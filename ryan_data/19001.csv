"A nice concept for the office or other area without a stove or microwave to heat up the water, the Bodum Electric Coffee and Tea maker is adequate only.The Positives.  THis is a relatively compact appliance that works without fail (but within some frustrating limits--see below), and that includes both a press for coffee and a filter for tea. In the Amazon.com picture, the tank on the right is filled with water, and one adds either coffee or tea (inside a filter) to the container on the right. When the two (washable) plastic containers are in place, the machine will turn on--heating the water which transfer over to the container with the coffee or tea.  Tea is brewed and coffee is pressed down with the familiar French press mechanism so that the water is infused with coffee and the finished product has no grounds.After brewing tea or coffee, one fits a safety lid (liquid won't pour without depressing a lever), and then pours the beverage into cup or mug. The heat turns off as soon as either container is removed.  To keep any remaining coffee/tea warm, one must remove the safety lid, put on the other (flat) lid, place it back on the Bodum, and then turn it back on.  These safety features are welcome, but also *too* cautious (as described later).  One other thoughtful feature, the tea/coffee container's hot bottom (from restng on the heating element) is somewhat protected by a lip that extends beyond it, thus minimizing contact with the surface upin which you place it.Coffee and tea taste fresh (after all, you just made it!), is hot (initially), takes a little over 7 minutes to empty a 4-5 cup (full) carafe ONCE it is heated (more on that, too) and brewing is safe. That said.....Negatives.  Yes, this will sound all ""Grinchy,""  but, taken togther, I found myself disappointed, feeling it's not worth the money even at a 30% discount over list price. Many of these negatives stem from what I see (others may disagree) with a over-concern for safety.  I'd feel differently if this were a device that children will use, but I doubt they will be the primary users.Temperature.  While the initial gulps will be enjoyably hot, replacing the container on the hot plate does not keep it close to this temperature: It loses its heat in a very short period. IT's not lukewarm or tepid, but it's just not hot.Tempermental.  It appears that if the two containers are not set in the machine ""just so,"" the Bodum will not begin heating (either that or it takes an inordinate amount of time--well over ten minutes) for a full water carafe to start transferring hot water to the other container. It appears to work best when the handle on the receiving carafe and the numbers indicating cups on the hot water carafe are facing outward--but that may just be coincidence. Basically, I have to fool around with these containers to feel confident it will begin heating.Extension Cord.  In a wonderfully paternalistic nod, Bodum informs us that--for safety reasons--they include a short ekectric cord, and that we may need to buy an extention cord (they assume that's safer, I suppose). Safety or less expense for Bodum, I wonder...Taste. Tea is not a problem, but French Press coffee should have a richer, somewhat oily (from the coffee beans) taste and texture. I think that the size of the receiving carafe mitigates against this. The carafe bottom is so wide that the coffee just settles at the bottom--there's little mixing of water and coffee as you press down (with little or no resistance) with the ""plunger.""  Although this may work better with smaller quantities of water, and even more coffee, the coffee is strong and fresh, but it does not taste very much like French Press coffee.Bottom line.  I can't really recommend this because of the price/value, temperature, and operating deficits noted above.  However, if you absolutely need your coffee/tea fix, have no easy access to a microwave or other heat source, and you're not too fussy about recreating conventionally made French Press coffee (and if you do use this to make tea, not just coffee), you may feel it's a worthwhile purchase.  While concern with safety is laudable, one wonders if designers could have made an equally safe product that produced a more satisfying taste at a more consistent temperature.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KPZZ09KG17C7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EKAROG#wasThisHelpful","R1KPZZ09KG17C7","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the time-honored tradition of ""more is more,"" Remington Azor 5 has five (5!)blades to hone your face to it's stubble-free, baby-bottom potential. We all know from ads that each blade not only has its own cutting action, but ""lifts"" your skin and whisker for an even closer cut by the next blade. The physics of this argument may be debatable, so let's stay with performance. First, though, a word about features:Appearance.  Surprisingly good. The look and almost the heft of metal in a $6-$11 product, with a grippy white inset on top (and the entire bottom) and sleek blue sides!  While no one will mistake this for real metal, it's a much more grown-up look than the supersized multi-blades and the cheapie orange plastic ones, if that matters to you.Feel in the hand. Very well-designed, with ergonomic contours for the hand-- especially the thumb--against which the razor rests. The white-colored material has a slightly sticky texture which helps hold it in your hand.Price. Good to great, depending on whether the Azor is on sale.  The blades are (really) cheaper than competitors for a similar product, and this will save you substantial money over time.General Functionality.  While there was a learning curve, you *can* attach the blade cartridge directly from its container to the razor; however, it's simpler (after some study of what fits where) to just press the blade on.  The pivoting blades move smoothly from its slight upward tilt(or--if holding the razor upside-down for a ""go against the grain"" upward tilt)to a 135 degree angle. In my test (see below), I had no cuts or razor burn, and the blade rinses well.Performance. The Ockham's razor of any evaluation. (Yes, I'm using that phrase incorrectly, as this has nothing to do with parsimony in one's assumptions, but somehow it just seems to fit).  Here's my experimental set-up: I used a blade on about its fifth shave (to test durability), and the skin-Azor interface was hot water with regular soap.  I used both downward and upward strokes for the closest shave obtainable.Results.  A very close, smooth shave--not perfect--but the best I've had from a razor with more than one blade. The bumper (a thin white strip that precedes the blades on an upward stroke) becomes slippery when wet and helpsthose FIVE blades glide over your face. I needed both upward and downward strokes for the closest shave, and a few horizontal strokes beneath the jaw where the contour is curviest.  Sometimes the pivot moved too much, but I discovered that I could position my thumb directly behind the blade to restrict its movement--thus almost replicating the simple but effective short power stroke of a single-bladed razor.  With just a little practice, you can master this easy technique and obtain a much closer shave.  Just as the pivot has its (resolvable) downside, so do the five blades: They quickly collect those shorn whispers, and without rinsing during your shave, you'll reduce the cutting efficacy.Bottom line. As shown in my mini-experiment, there is no single perfect razor (both electric and single-blade have their advantages), but, on balance, this is the best shave for the money out there.  With the adjustments I've suggested (or some of your own), you'll discover how to get the most out of this relatively attractive, inexpensive, and quite effective razor. Now we just wait for the launch of the 15-bladed razor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R230OQGJP15AVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ACNPKA#wasThisHelpful","R230OQGJP15AVL","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Menthol, Menthol, Menthol.That's the first screen for anyone interested in trying this product. If you don't like the scent of menthol (with slight undertones of eucalyptus), you will like not the KING of SHAVES ALPHAGEL (what a name!) Sensitive Shave Gel, no matter how well it works for you.But let's say you can't get enough menthol!  (I'm in between--it doesn't bother me particularly, but I found the scent strong enough that, if I used Alphagel, I wouldn't want to attend a meeting without washing my face several times afterwards and letting some time go by).  The clear lotion has a nice feeling to it and applies easily to one's face. True to its description, it doesn't foam (think 1920's slapstick), nor does it even work up a lather comparable to plain soap). Bascially, you have a slightly viscous mostly-clear (some of it will turn a little white) gel on your face, like aloe vera gel only much lighter.My experience with the gel leads to this conclusion: Alphagel does much more to protect your skin than to enhance your shave.  It did not seem to appreciably soften my 2-day old stubble or give me a closer or faster shave.  In fact, the decreased friction seemed to make the razor work less well (although I used a multiple blade non-electric razor; a single blade may work better). I'd say it reduces the pain of blade on skin without lubrication, but soap and water (or water alone) would probably do as well or better.The biggest advantage is that the many natural and chemlab produced ingredients in Alphagel D) make your face feel much smoother after shaving than soap and water.  Very, very smooth, in fact.One other note--the ingredients. This may look clear and natural, but take a look at he ingredient list (from the Remington web site):Aqua (Water), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe vera) leaf juice, Sodium laureth sulfate, Glycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) seed oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea tree) leaf oil, Eucalyptus Globulus leaf oil, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) leaf oil, Tocopheryl acetate, Camphor, Agar, Benzophenone-4, Mica, Cocamidopropyl betaine, Polyquaternium-11, Polyacrylamide, Limonene, Propylene glycol, Sodium chloride, Citric acid, Triethanolamine, Magnesium nitrate, Magnesium chloride, Benzyl alcohol, Potassium sorbate, Sodium benzoate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, CI 77891 (Titanium dioxide), CI 60730 (Ext Violet 2), CI 42090 (Blue 1).Bottom line: I wouldn't recommend this unless 1) you like a MENTHOL/Eucalyptus/camphor scent, and 2) you have experiece with other non-foaming gels and they woork well with your razor, and 3) you don't mind  Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Polyquaternium-11, Polyacrylamide and many other substances mingling with the more familiar and natural ingredients like tea tree, spearmint, and grape seed oils, and aloe vera.Happy shaving!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25H55PFNFZ778/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ACNPLO#wasThisHelpful","R25H55PFNFZ778","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh, the times that I or my friends have downloaded a free anti-virus program, only to have it conflict with whatever anti-virus program came with the computer. The results may be that one of the other (or both) won't work; worse, the computer may crash or work more slowly.I haven't had that problem with Trend Micro Titanium. Yes, I did remove the downloaded freeware I had been using to enhance the computer's bundled virus protection, but once I did that, there have been no problems (and I've been using this for several months now).It installs very easily, and operates smoothly and quickly. As other reviewers have noted, there's not a whole lot of user control. This is an anti-virus program that works quietly behind the scenes, occasionally popping up to ask whether you really want to go that site or add that software.  However, the unobtrusive nature of Titanium is somewhat of a drawback as well:  It's difficult to determine how well it's working, what it has removed or prevented. Go ahead, brag a little, Trend Micro!  That will give me more guidance about whether I want to purchase this again. If next year is anything like this year, the price is heavily discounted mid-year (perhaps earlier), but it's not worth it if yo uhave no other virus protection.Bottom Line: A satisfactory product that does not interfere with my computer, and that seems to work well. I can say I've had fewer problems with this software than many others. There are probably more powerful (and expensive) anti-virus tools out there, but in mnay respects this seems superior to some of the freebies available for download.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10Y8G9EP5VFAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VIVYIA#wasThisHelpful","R10Y8G9EP5VFAF","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm going to assume that you're not pinching pennies, or that you order supplies for a company that isn't. That's because, at the current Amazon.com price (at a nice discount as of this date), you'll be paying a little over a dollar per hanging file folder; certainly, you can get a different type for cheaper.However, I'm not sure you'll find something as nice in this price range.  The first thing you may notice (other than the nicely selected pastel colors of light blue, green, and the more somber beige/brown) is the stronly reinforced tabs that cover almost all of the bar at the top of the folder. This is usually the most vulnerable point for ri[s and tears, as you remove and replace the folders from and to your desk drawer's hanging folder structure. The metal bar is very solid and won't bend unless you're doing strength contests at the office. (And, really, should you really be doing such shenanigans on company time...)  Moreover, the exposed part of the metal bar is coated; it's warm and smooth to the touch.Folder titles may be directly hand-written or typed on self-adhesive labels on the tabs extending up from the folder.  These tabs are staggered for ease of viewing while in a file drawer; tabs are located atop either the first, middle or last third of the folder.  Quarter-length tabs would have allowed for more horizontal visibility while in a drawer, but these have the advantage of a larger writing area.  The folders are made with thick 10% (minimum) ""post-consumer recycled content.""This is a solid buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WVV7G3TAOQ3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001L1RF9G#wasThisHelpful","R2WVV7G3TAOQ3T","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...And here I thought it would transmit my brian waves to my computer, automatically correcting any misspellings or illogical ideas.This light stylus is used instead of one's (much bigger) finger tip to operate electronic keyboards, other electonic ""buttons,"" and to scroll though (in any direction) windows on Ipods, Iphones, Ipads, and other electronic devices not made by Apple (if there are any suc devices). No more smudges, no more pressing ""G"" instead of ""F,"" and no sore fingers from all thta scrolling.I really liked this product. It has great sensitivity (you don't have to press down hard to activate the screen), and it feels like it ""bounces"" back after you're done pressing in one spot. (It has a very interesting design, featuring a kind of sheath over the harder metal point at the end. This also, of course, protects your screen).You can buy similar products for a lot less (as low as $2.00) and a lot more; this seems to represent a good balance between functionality and economy. I have just two minor complaints; these lower my rating from a full 5 to a 4.5.  At this price, I'd expect some sort of GRIP, both to increase one's hold on the pen, and so that the pen has a warmer feeling to it. Again, a minor point.  The other quibble is that this might be very easy  to lose.  Although the pen clip works well,providing an option of colors (or, say a pen GRIP in a contrasting color) would reduce the liklihood of misplacing or losing the product.Bottom line: Works very well, greatly eases use of electonic gadgets, minor flaws, an OK price--but worrh the money.

"The only problem I have with this product is the Amazon.com website for it. IF you read it too hastily you may think you're purchasing one of the many  other types of Sticky Notes they sell. These include notes with adhesive at the top as well as the bottom, transparent notes, perferated sticky notes, fercryinoutloud!Nope, these are quite similar to the most commonly-used sticky note product: Post-Its, the pioneer and the predominant brand. Avery would love to change that. There's not much difference here, so price and current dicounts may be one deciding factor.

Go with the upstart, or honor the company that invented it, ecology or education, 3 (by now, fairly boring) 3M pastel colors, or 4 (somwhat fresher) colors from Avery...

"""Bottom Line Up Top"":  While individual tastes may vary, this healthy and humanely produced dog food is a real treat that bot you can your dog will feel good about; you in your head and heart, the dog in a very happy tummy.This is ""one cookie"" (Newman's great line in ""The Young Philadelphians) that was a HUGE hit with our 14-year old Golden Retriever, ""Sadie, The Wonder Dog."" After some circumspect sniffing and tentative gnawing, Sadie got into these in a major way.  Yes, they're crunchy, but Sadie had no trouble chewing it up and gave us the patented ""Retriever Look"" signaling she wanted MORE.Ingredients:The treats are about 1"" by 2"" and are scored so that they can be broken in half.  THe ingredient list reads like something you'd find at a California health food retreat (well, except fo rthe meat):Organic barley, Organic lamb, Organic carrots, Organic apples, Organic palm oil, Organic molasses.In the interest of full disclosure I should tell you that Sadie is not very particular when it comes to food. Not at all. Oranges, cherry plums, lettuce, bok choy, and tofu(!) are cherished by her; she holds the bok choy with both paws as if it were a bone. She's not totally easy (she refuses to eat spinach--probably some early puppy experience), but calling her the goat of Goldens would not be a cheap shot.However, it's important that Sadie stay away from typical canine snacks, especially at her age. She has arthritis, and a poor diet has been linked to a number of disorders in older dogs. Fortunately, our vet has warned us about this, and it's become necessary to tell a certian neighbor to stop feeding her raw hamburger, baked potatoes with sour cream, bacon, etc.Now, I don't want to guilt-trip anyone over what they're feeding their pooches, but here's a (partial) list of culinary ""BAD DOGS"" that you won't find in Newman's pet foods. (The following--and MORE--can be found at [...]. WARNING: The following contains graphic descriptions of typical dog food ingredients.  HIDE YOUR CHILDREN.NO Poultry by-products - Ground, rendered, cleaned slaughtered poultry carcass parts such as necks, feet, lymph nodes, undeveloped eggs and intestines (and a small amount of feathers). The quality is very inconsistent between batches. Note: By product meals are often derived from 4-D meat sources - defined as food animals that have been rejected for human consumption because they were presented to the meat packing plant as ""Dead, Dying, Disabled or Diseased"".NO Chemical fertilizers - Chemical fertilizers have been incriminated in serious health problems in animals and are not allowed in organic-certified products.NO Antibiotics or steroids - Long-term daily administration may result in a compromised immune system, muscle wasting, and destruction of the friendly bacteria living in the intestines that aid the digestion of food and assimilation of nutrients.NO Chemical additives or artificial preservatives - Chemical antioxidants, such as ethoxyquin, BHT or BHA, that were designed to extend the shelf life and reduce fat spoilage (rancidity) of pet foods may cause allergic reactions and affect liver and kidney functions.NO Artificial Colors and Dyes - Coloring agents provide an artificial ""rich and meaty"" look to modify the appearance of highly processed foods and make them more appealing to pet owners.As if this weren't enough, 100's of thousand of dollars are donated by the Newman Foundation to animal advocates (lest you think this means radical animal activists, we're talking mainstream things like animal shelters, etc. Details available at the website above).Sadie says, ""Give it a try!""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6PT5T7FQT9YY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045XE32E#wasThisHelpful","R6PT5T7FQT9YY","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been detailing as a hobby for fifteen years now and during that time I have experimented with a lot of different products.  Regarding waxes, initially I used liquid waxes but I never liked the fact that you had to let some of them haze before you could begin to remove them and once you started to buff them out, they would create dust or require the application of a quick detailer spray to remove caked on residue.  For wax, I strictly use paste waxes now.I used the Mothers California Gold Pure Brazilian Carnauba about 10 years ago and the ease of use and quality really amazed me because it is very easy to apply, does not need to dry, and creates a solid barrier from the elements; it also smells great!  I've used this on black cars and white cars with excellent results.  This wax and Meguiars Gold Class were two waxes that really amazed me but I just like the Mothers better.  I haven't tried Zaino products or some of the really expensive stuff from Zymol but if you are looking at those products, You're probably not buying your car care stuff from an autoparts store.  I feel the Mothers is an exceptional wax considering it is readily available to everyone and is as good, if not better, than any high-end wax.Please read my detailing tips below and I hope they offer you some insight into how some of these products should correctly be used.Wax is not what makes your car ""shine.""  Wax is actually the final step that ""protects"" all the other steps that you have done.This is how I detail my cars...**  Work in the shade and when the paint is cool or else you will be doing more work than you need to.1.  Wash with dish soap or paint prep product like Griot's Paint Prep to remove any old wax residue and dry car2.  Clay with detailer spray (use the spray liberally...don't be afraid to make a mess with the spray and dry car when complete)3.  Machine Polish with random orbital (you can polish by hand but that takes a lot more work)4.  Hose down car...Griot's used to make an interesting orange-based ""Pre-Wax Cleanser"" (since discontinued) to remove any caked-on polish5.  Glaze...(Apply as many coats as you have the time for)6.  Hose down car and dry completely7.  Apply wax or paint sealant (Apply as many coats as you have the time for)**  Maintain with a ""Spray-On Wax"" product after each washOut of those steps, the most important is step 1 because if you're surface is not prepped correctly, the wax will not adhere correctly and can streak or look cloudy.  It's actually steps 3 and 5 that give you the ""show-car"" shine.  If you do those two steps right, then the wax is actually the step that protects all your hard work from the elements.  If you never had to take your car outside, you actually don't need wax as the polish and glaze gives you the ""wet-look.""  The concept is very similar to looking at a brand new crystal glass and one that has been run through a dishwasher for years.  Polish removes or lessens the swirl marks that refract the light and give your paint a dull look; glaze fills in whatever the polish missed and adds other filler/shine properties; wax is simply protection from the elements.Don't get me wrong, if you take any car and throw a coat of wax on, it will look better than it did without the wax because the wax does share similar properties as polish, glaze, and spray-on quick detailers but from a detailer's perspective, that's not the correct way to use wax.It sounds like a lot of work but you are only doing the seven-step process once a year or every other year.  If you're paint is properly maintained, you can just clay and wax every other month and then maintain that look with a spray-on wax every time you wash the car.Try this process out and you will see a difference.  I use Griot's polishes but I use the Mothers glaze and California Gold Pure Carnauba.  They say not to mix and match brands but I've been doing it with no problems.  Stay away from cleaner waxes as those have polishing properties and if you already polished your car, why would you introduce more polish?  Always stick to a product that says ""Pure Carnauba.""I want to point out that I have never seen a wax make it through an automatic car wash.  If you do all this work and run your car through one of these machines, you will lose all of your work as the detergents they use are very harsh and will strip every bit of wax off.  Only wash your car at home with a true car wash product that specifically states it won't strip wax.  Also, If you keep your car out in the baking sun, the heat will eventually melt the wax.  They say paint sealants are able to withstand this but I haven't used a paint sealant.  If your car is not garaged, you will probably have to wax your car more times than someone who maintains a garaged vehicle.For step #7 in my process, the Mothers California Gold Pure Brazilian Carnauba is my favorite wax and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11TGTXMF9D9F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002U2V1O#wasThisHelpful","R11TGTXMF9D9F0","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first saw this particular model, I knew it would look great in my living room and match my TV stand. I liked the fact that this model was not boring and that it had nice moldings and pillars to enhance the look. It's usually hit or miss with this kind of furniture but it really looked good in the pictures.  When I received it, I was very satisfied with the quality and the look.  Assembly took several hours because I like to take my time.It is a very sturdy piece of furniture and it just has a quality look and feel to it.  The door hinges feel solid and I don't notice any wobble or anything.There are a few things that I was somewhat disappointed with:1.  The doors themselves could be of better quality.  When you tap on them, they have a strange hollow sound to them as if the center piece and the frame are two separate pieces that are not held tightly together.  I guess that's what you get for this price.  Aesthetically the doors look just fine.2.  The back piece that you have to nail in is not the best quality and detracts from an otherwise great piece of furniture.  The back piece has a rippled look to it and when the light hits it, it is more visible; in a dim room, you can't observe this.  Again, for under two hundred bucks, I think that's the best you will get at this price point.  I have another bookshelf that I purchased from a furniture store and the back piece is of much better quality but I also paid more for that bookshelf.Other than those two issues, I really am impressed with this library/bookshelf and I am glad I bought it.  It has a very nice look to it and I have received many compliments about it.  It certainly looks more expensive than the price would suggest.The only modification I made to the library was that I installed two rubber bumpers to the door stops so that when you close the doors, it gives it a more solid feel and is somewhat quieter.  I didn't install them on the wood, I installed them onto the black door stops that snap into the cabinet area.I want to point out that you cannot use wood glue if you wanted to because all the pieces except maybe 1 have finished edges so there would be no place for you to apply wood glue to make the item even sturdier.  The unit is very solid without any extra glue so it doesn't even matter.  Also, a few of the pieces are not labeled so make sure you place all the pieces out and take your time when picking which goes where as a few of them look alike.  The color is also darker than the picture on Amazon.  I have a TV stand that is an ""espresso"" color and this library is just as dark.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22FN3ZKH7Y6HW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007N7ZFK8#wasThisHelpful","R22FN3ZKH7Y6HW","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own the ceramic box cutter which is an excellent product and I just purchased the retractable pocket cutter (Model 10514) which uses the same blade as the box cutter.This safety cutter is the total opposite of the box cutter in terms of functionality.  The blade is too small to do anything and the magnet is weak.  Also, I don't like the fact that the tiny blade is exposed because you can barely see it and if you are not careful, I am sure you can cut yourself or something important.  The retractable pocket cutter is what I really need for opening packages that come in the mail or opening blister packs because it has a retractable blade; a larger blade; and a rubber grip with what looks to be a larger magnet.  I don't know what I will use the safety cutter for and I might just toss it for safety reasons.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UZWK4KC62174/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002OOVC84#wasThisHelpful","R3UZWK4KC62174","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I like about these baskets are that they are very sturdy and well-made.  You can fill them up with heavy items and when you grab them on any one side, they won't bend or flex.  I was looking for storage baskets a few years ago and I mistakenly purchased a lesser model which has less capacity and is not as well made.  I will be upgrading those baskets to these InterDesign baskets.The baskets are also stable when they are stacked as the base and top of each basket securely fit together.  Also, the design and color are very neutral and blend in very well. They are also made in the USA.At first I was hesitant to purchase them at ten bucks a piece but they are certainly a quality product and worth the extra money.Highly Recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JBHO00QVH8G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00097ICVS#wasThisHelpful","R3JBHO00QVH8G9","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I put this in the bathroom so that I can see a little bit in total darkness before hitting the lights.  It serves its purpose and illuminates as I would like it to but the batteries will only last for four weeks.  The bathroom is a high traffic area so it is going on and off several times a day.  When you factor the cost of AAA batteries and the fact that I am only getting about four weeks of use out of them, this little light can get really expensive really fast.  Also, installing the batteries is a pain because the housing uses four plastic screws to access the three AAA batteries, I've changed the batteries out twice and my screwdriver is eating up the plastic.  I've also noticed that one screw is not as tight as it used to be.  It's all just a hassle and the plastic is pretty cheap to begin with.I have a couple of Mr. Beams battery powered lights for a closet and the den but those run on D batteries so they last much longer and are even much brighter.  Also, the plastic on the Mr. Beams product is much better quality and feels more solid.I guess it depends on how you want to use this light but I don't think using it in a bathroom when it is dark is asking too much.  Beyond that, the light is not even that bright so I don't understand where else you could put it for it to be useful.I don't recommend it.  If you want a battery powered motion light, make sure it is using higher power batteries.I will be removing this light and putting it away.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GUDD9I8Z6RB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9SVM06#wasThisHelpful","R1GUDD9I8Z6RB6","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up a small 4oz bottle just to see what this product could do and I am very satisfied with it.  I used it to clean up an oily and greasy granite kitchen countertop and tile backsplash and this was the only product I have ever used that cut right through it with ease.  Usually with other products, the mess would smear around and take a significant amount of elbow grease.  I noticed that I was putting in less elbow grease with this product for much better results. I want to add that I followed up the degreaser with a Vapamore MR-100 steam cleaner.  The steam cleaner alone could not do the job as the KrudKutter was needed to break up all the stains.  But the two products together have given me amazing results.The product has a very thin consistency and it is clear with  no noticeable odor.  Previously with other cleaners, the smell was so obnoxious that I could not use them unless the windows and den door were wide open.  On top of that, the other products would make the room smell terrible for hours.It says that this product is non-toxic and that is very important to me because I have some degreasers that are very irritant and not fun to use.  I like that I can use as much of this as I want without any fear that I am endangering my health.I will be switching over to KrudKutter as my go-to degreaser.  They make a ""Tough Task"" variant which I am going to try as well.Excellent product","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MTEZP7IDRL6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000S8EQFO#wasThisHelpful","R1MTEZP7IDRL6K","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I opened the package and knew right away that it was going back.  This is the second Rolodex product I have received that I have been disappointed with.  Both times, the issue was related to the quality of the mesh.The printer stand just looked sloppy to me; the mesh appeared to be dented in several places; the metal borders did not appear straight in a few locations; and the legs, when properly attached, were still wobbly.The worst part was that it was shipped with Styrofoam and I needed to use a vacuum cleaner to clean up the mess and then clean up the little pieces that got lodged in the mesh!Functionally, the printer stand just looks clumsy.  It actually looks better in the pictures and that's the reason I bought it but in real life I think it is just too big for what it is supposed to do.  Also, I don't like the fact that the shelf does not slide out because it is a deep shelf and if you were to lose something inside, it could be inconvenient to reach in and retrieve it.Lucky for me, I had another UPS shipment coming in the same day so I packaged this up quickly and sent it back on its way.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHCTQJ8K4X7H2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IJFEYU#wasThisHelpful","RHCTQJ8K4X7H2","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My Epson inkjet is just not economical when printing documents. It's weird, even though I print in B&W, the color cartridges seem to get used up. I bought this Brother model to print my word documents and PPT presentations for school because they are usually 20-30 pages each.Wireless setup was a breeze and I had the unit up and running in about 15 minutes. I have nothing but praise for this laser printer especially at this price point. I got it when it was 91 dollars and I think that is a steal for what you get.The printer looks great, it has a small footprint, and it does the job very well. The noise, as some reviewer's pointed out, doesn't bother me. Actually, my Epson is much much louder when printing and it has a high-pitched shrieking sound and sometimes it even sounds like it is breaking! The Brother laser printer sounds like the fan on your computer; only a little louder. The fan on the Brother does keep running for a little while after the print job is completed but it eventually shuts off. I don't mind it at all.The only weird thing is that when the printer turns on or when it is printing, the lights in my room flicker a little. Then again, I have it plugged in with a two prong adapter so I don't know if it needs to be grounded. (Problem has since been solved as I have moved the printer to a three-pronged grounded outlet.)The speed and economy of a laser printer is well worth the investment. Printing text on an inkjet is a waste of time and a waste of money. I wish I bought this laser printer years ago. At this price, you can't lose.I am very happy with this product and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XIN7VAAY1NDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00450DVDY#wasThisHelpful","R2XIN7VAAY1NDJ","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a pair of similar adidas soccer shorts several years ago and I thought these would be of the same quality. I was wrong.I received the package today, tried the shorts on, took them off, put them back in the package, and printed a return label.The reason I am returning them is because the material is very thin and they don't look like they are of high quality. It's hard to explain, they just don't feel right. I realize they are a soccer short but I have seen better soccer shorts. I was wondering why they were only 20 bucks and now I know. Also, you need to buy these one size up. If you usually wear medium sweatpants, you should get these in a large as the medium is very tight around the waist.You don't have to take my word for it but I think you will feel the same way if you see them for yourself.Spend a few more bucks and buy better quality.You get what you pay for.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBU645EXUZJ6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FPH7KC#wasThisHelpful","RBU645EXUZJ6Y","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice table. My Sony 60"" sits perfectly on it and they look good together. The finish of the wood is high quality and the construction is very good. I think it actually looks more expensive than what it costs.I ran into a few issues related to the setup that I wanted to point out so that you don't make the same mistakes I did.  Assembling this table took me about several hours longer than it should have because I installed the center panel incorrectly TWICE!  The instructions should be more accurate and tell you to install the center panel with the smooth side facing forward and the cam-lock holes facing down.  I installed the smooth side facing the rear and then when I thought I had corrected that, I actually installed the panel with the cam locks facing up.  It's easy to make this mistake because you install this section first before mounting it to the two larger bottom and top panels and it is easy to confuse the configuration.  Just take your time with this step before tightening the cam-locks because if you make the same mistake I did, you will have to disassemble a good part of the unit to make the correction.I want to point out that if you are installing AV equipment in the side shelves, you will most probably need to install them through the rear first and then screw the rear panels on.  This is because in the front, the openings are obstructed by the beveled edges of the side panels and you loose about several inches of clearance.  This can actually be a pain if you are planning on adding more equipment or adjusting the cables of the existing equipment already in the cabinet.Regarding ventilation, My AV receiver doesn't seem to get too hot to begin with and since I have the back panel off, I think it has some room to breathe.  I have my Xbox 360 in one of the cabinets and after an hour of playing, it does get really hot.  I don't think you can do anything about it though.I have my audio video receiver and a Monster Power Center installed in the center shelves and I had to remove the middle rear panel cover as it was impossible to manage all the wires from those two small holes.  If you have a very simple setup, you can keep the rear panel on but if you have a lot of wires, just leave the center panel off because it is not worth the inconvenience. Just imagine if an HDMI cable were to come loose, you would have a hard time trying to see where it plugs in if the center panel was attached.Initially I was not a fan of the silver/platinum hardware but now I actually like it and I think it looks pretty good and provides good contrast. Initially I wanted to buy hinges that matched the color of the wood but it doesn't bother me anymore.I broke a few of the plastic cam-lock covers and my screwdriver chewed up a few of the cam locks during the assembly.  I contacted Sonax and they quickly sent me these replacement parts free of charge and very quickly.  Sonax customer support is excellent and that is more of a reason to buy this product.Overall, if you need a 60"" stand, I think this is a really good one for the price. I am very happy with it and I have received many compliments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FXIZJQBI4FLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZAOANE#wasThisHelpful","R2FXIZJQBI4FLG","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already had a standard box cutter and I bought this just for fun to see if it could make the job any easier.I just finished cutting up a box used to ship a large TV table.  I can say that this ceramic box cutter did the job better than I could have with the metal blade.  The cutting was just more fluid and the tool feels really good in your hands.  The cardboard was a little thicker than a standard shipping box and the ceramic blade did a great job of cutting it.  I don't know how to describe it but the ceramic blade makes a very distinctive ""hissing"" sound when cutting through the cardboard.  I think that demonstrates that it is sharper than the metal blade because the metal blade makes a more lower pitched sound.Also, with the metal box cutters, my hand usually gets fatigued when doing a large job because the tool does not feel good in your hand.  This ceramic cutter feels good in your hand and I had little to no fatigue. I want to point out that you should take care not to drop the tool as I can see how the tool would be susceptible to breaking if it fell to the ground.Other than that, if you are cutting up a lot of boxes, I highly recommend this tool.EDIT 7/6/15:  I just wanted to update this review with a few more thoughts and suggestions.  I recently was in the basement cutting up all the Amazon boxes that I have and it just struck me that if I didn't use this tool, It would take me forever to get through that job with scissors or even a regular box cutter.  Those boxes were chopped up and tied up into medium-sized squares in no time.The ceramic blades obviously last a long time but they are also double-sided so they last even longer.  I purchased the box cutter several years ago and have been using the same side of the blade since then.  For this last job, I flipped the blade and I noticed how much sharper it was.  I guess I'm going to get another few years out of this side of the blade which is great.I noticed that there is an orange and green model of this tool and I wanted to explain the difference and my opinion on which is better.  The orange tool is a manual cutter which means that you extend the blade and it remains extended until you pull back on the lever.  The green color model is automatic which means that the blade stays extended only for as long as you have your finger or thumb on the lever.  I can understand the automatic model from a safety perspective but I think the orange manual model is the better tool.  The tool is so well-designed that for some packages, I just extend the blade and gently pull on the ""U-Shaped"" finger guide and it easily cuts through packaging tape.  With the green model, you would need to put more pressure for a simple task like that which I don't think is effective.  I have never cut my skin or anything by accident with the orange tool so I don't really see a need for an automatic model.  The other day I purchased the Slice Ceramic Pocket Cutter (Model # 10514) which is an automatic cutter but in this case I think the automatic mechanism is better because the tool is so small and your fingers will be on the lever at all times.  Also, since it has a magnet, you can keep it attached to a fridge or a metal object on your desk without worrying if the blade was left extended.  I think the 10400 + the 10514 are a great combination for a variety of tasks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B8QD4R6HZRGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00428M7IO#wasThisHelpful","R2B8QD4R6HZRGM","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my home theater so that I could hook up all the internet-enabled components. I used to think that when a product was Ethernet-enabled that meant that you had to run 100 feet of Ethernet cable from your router, through the walls, and to your components. That sounded messy to me so I always looked for WiFi-enabled products.  I initially thought about buying a bridge instead but my understanding is that the Powerline adapters were faster since they are a wired connection.  I can't verify that but that is what I was told so double check.I was also told that for the Powerline adapter kit to work, both outlets must be on the same circuit.  I don't know about you but I am not an electrician and I really do not know what this means.  So I just crossed my fingers, bought this product, and hoped for the best.The product contains two adapters; one that you plug into an outlet by your router and another that plugs into an outlet wherever your other equipment is located.  You also get two Cat5e cables which I find to be a little on the shorter side so you may want to buy a six foot or longer cable.  There is no instruction manual included just a small diagram. Honestly, you don't need an instruction manual because the four-step diagram really sums up the installation process.Here is what you do:1.  Plug the single port end into an outlet by your router2.  Connect it to a port on your router3.  Plug the other port near the other equipment4.  Connect this port to the port on the equipmentThat's it, no settings to change and you will be online (assuming both outlets are on the same circuit.)  All I had to do was go into the TV menu and perform the ""connect to internet"" setup and the TV recognized the signal right away.I highly recommend you spend the extra few bucks and get the four port version because you never know when you will need the extra ports.Regarding the circuit breaker issue.  My understanding is that the kitchen and the bathroom are on different circuits from the bedroom and living room.  Apparently my bedroom and the living room are on the same circuit so perhaps that might be the same for a lot of other people.I'm glad I found out about this product instead of just buying an overpriced WiFi adapter for my TV or buying a more expensive Blu-Ray player with built in WiFi. A wired connection is best so try that first before wireless.This is such a cool product and I think you will agree. I highly recommend it.EDIT: 6-month update 1/9/13:  I have never had an issue with this unit since I hooked it up. The signal and performance have remained strong!EDIT#2:  7/21/15:  Just want to point out that you should not plug these into a surge protector and perhaps even a power strip.  I recently re-did my living room and plugged this into a surge protector and I did not get signal.  Initially I thought it was something else and I kept resetting it but it turns out you have to plug these directly into an outlet.  Once I did that, problem solved.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RFGEVASY4WFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JG5S6U#wasThisHelpful","R3RFGEVASY4WFT","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If your speakers have five-way binding posts, I recommend you install banana connectors as opposed to just using bare wire.  The banana connectors look much nicer and offer a secure connection.  Bare speaker wire can corrode over time so why risk that when you can pop these on with minimum effort?I like the Monster product better than some other competitors because they look nice, they feel like a quality product, and I like the design of the rubber grips and knurled cap.  I have these on Monster XP cable and the install was easy and they look great on my NHT Super Zero 2.0'sJust buy them. You will be happy.

"I just bought some new speakers and I needed to put some banana plugs on my cables.  After looking at what was available on Amazon, I purchased this model based on the reviews and the fact that it looks unique. The red color also matches my FACOM tools!The last time I tried to strip some speaker cable, the ten dollar model I bought at Home Depot cut the cover as well as some of the copper wire strands. It was not a clean and uniform process.  I was not happy with that tool and I thought you had to spend a lot of money for a tool that could do the job right. That was until I used this Neiko model.This model did not come with any directions but I found a YouTube video that might help:  just go to youtubedotcom and type in qpIWgRmRIMwThis tool made quick work of some Monster Cable XP and made a clean and uniform cut.  I actually cut two wires at the same time and the process was so easy that I could not believe it.  Not even one copper wire was harmed.  What blew me away was after I made the cut, a piece of the thin shielding was left on the wire and I made another cut on that area and it took that tiny film off without cutting the copper wire!!!  All you have to do is adjust the red stopper thing if you want to create uniform cuts for many wires.  Other than that, you just put the wire in and it strips it cleanly. I also like the ""ratcheting"" sound that the tool makes; it just adds to the quality.The tool itself is built very well, it looks very nice and feels great in your hand, and most importantly it gets the job done and done right.  The only thing you should be careful of is getting your fingers caught in the crimping area.  The crimping area is right between the handles and it is rather sharp so don't let your fingers wander around there as you could get injured.I smiled as I was using this tool.  I just wish I had more speaker wire to cut!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HPUQL9E3RBDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IYTCG6#wasThisHelpful","R1HPUQL9E3RBDD","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not a bad printer but it is inefficient with respect to ink usage.  I use it a lot for scanning and copying and it has helped me immensely; it looks pretty good too.It gets one star because it literally gobbles up all the ink. Sometimes I even wonder if somebody is using it while I am not at home.  I thought I got this for a good deal back in 2009 until I realized that they got their money back many times over through ink sales.  I only print in text mode and it still sucks up all the ink.  I don't even print pictures or anything like that.The scanning and copying capability are actually very useful and the Wi-Fi works flawlessly.I can also verify that the machine literally shuts down if you have only one empty cartridge.  Even if your black cartridge is full, if a color cartridge is out, the printer stops functioning till you refill it. It's like Epson is holding the printer hostage till you buy their ink.The printer is also a little noisy compared to some others that I have heard even in quiet mode.  It makes a very high pitched sound when printing. My old HP from 1998 was fairly quiet.  The carbon fiber look on the top is nice and the small display looks good as well.  It has a card reader as well which is useful but redundant in this day and age.I'd like to really give it a better rating because it has some useful features but the ink issue is just unacceptable. Due to cost concerns, in the near future I will probably have to upgrade this to another model or perhaps a laser printer.EDIT November 20, 2012: I purchased a Brother laser printer and a Brother all-in-one inkjet and I packed this Epson printer up and put it in the basement.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R112IQT46EL43Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026KXR1Q#wasThisHelpful","R112IQT46EL43Z","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I specifically bought this to break up cardboard boxes.  Here is an example of the last time I used this utility knife:I just purchased a 60"" LED TV last week which was double boxed in one of the biggest cardboard boxes I have ever seen.  The freight company took the TV out of the box and left the box in my den.  The box is so big that it wouldn't even fit through the door and down the stairs to my basement.  I actually dragged it down to the basement and everything was going well until the box pinned me to the end of the staircase and wall. I didn't know what to do because I couldn't push it back up because it was lodged between one of the steps and the ceiling; the box couldn't go back up and it couldn't go down either because the staircase makes a sharp left turn. I didn't know what to do and I didn't have my phone and I was home alone so nobody would hear my screams for help.  I did notice that there was about four or five inches between the box and the railing so I mustered all of my strength and charged up the stairs like there was no tomorrow to my toolbox where I keep this knife. Some how I made it back up the stairs and when I came back down I used some force to squish the box a little.  If I was a large man, I would have been stuck in the basement till somebody came home to get me out.  Anyway, I knew I had to chop this box up on the staircase so I got the knife and I proceeded to dismantle it as it sat on the staircase.  Within 15 minutes, I broke it up enough to toss most of the large panels downstairs. With all the weird angles, it took a lot out of me and I had to return the next day to finish the job.  Now that I had the panels flat on the floor, this little tool went through each and every panel like a hot knife through butter.  And I want to note that this box is thicker than your regular cardboard shipping box and this knife still cut through it with ease.  Now I have the contents of the cardboard box in one trash compactor bag in small pieces.  I completed the job in 1.5 hours as it is much harder than you would think and I needed to take several breaks. Over the years, I abused this knife so much and it still does the job each and every time.I'm sure it has many other uses but for what I use it for, it is indispensable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EBHK87OPHHX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002X204#wasThisHelpful","R3EBHK87OPHHX5","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I noticed was that the cable itself is thick and high quality.  I was expecting some thin cheap cable of subpar quality but I was very surprised to see that this cable was built very well.  The cable is actually as thick as what you would buy from Monster. I'm glad I bought the BlueRigger and not the Amazon Basics cable which I thought looked too cheap.  The cable is imprinted with ""High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet"" on the side and it comes with some useful plastic covers for the tips so that you can protect the ends when not in use. The cable arrived spooled up in a sealed plastic bag in an Amazon box.I bought four of these cables. I am currently using two and they worked the moment I plugged them in. I watched ""Planet Earth"" on Blu-ray with no flickering issues and the picture was stunning.  For the price, I am very satisfied.

"I only bought this because it was on sale.The biggest problem I have with this razor is that the design does not allow you to shave your upper lip area effectively.  I constantly have a small bit of stubble left in that area and if you try to use the razor to shave against the grain to shave that stubble, then you risk cutting yourself as the 5 blades make the surface area so big that you cannot maneuver in that area.I don't know why people make razor's with 4 and 5 blades when 2 is more than enough.  When you have so many blades, you cannot effectively cut around the contours of your face. This razor also cannot cut the chin area or neck area effectively.  There is always stubble left behind.  If you make 2 and 3 passes, then you again risk cutting or irritating the skin.I am just waiting for the last two cartridges to run out and then I am going back to the Mach3.Since 1999, I haven't found anything better than the Mach3.EDIT: I decided to give this unit 3 stars instead of 1 stars because I think it does give you a close shave on the flatter areas of your face and I am actually getting used to the handle of the razor.  It loses stars because you honestly need this plus a smaller razor to get to the upper lip area; using two razors is just not convenient.  The cartridge is just too big to navigate the upper lip without accidentally cutting yourself.  The ergonomics of the razor are actually pretty good but the five-blade design is just too cumbersome for intricate areas. Mach3 shaves equally as close and it gets the upper lip area so I recommend that more.EDIT #2: The more I use this, the more I am liking it.  But you still need that second safety razor to get the upper lip.  I guess my skin is just getting used to the blade and I like how it shaves the rest of my face.

"I used this for my undergrad medical anthro course.Like the other reviewer said, this book has absolutely no pictures or illustrations. It is just page after page of text. I mean, wouldn't it be easier to visualize a group of people or a disease if you at least had a picture to look at? For an undergrad course, I thought this book was difficult reading. There were a few selections that I read through and by the end I had no idea what I had just read about. Most of the selections are a few pages to about 10 pages but they are just so hard to read and understand. The language is definitely graduate level and some of the discussions are a bit over the top. It's actually not a traditional textbook but a selection of essays so this is probably why I did not notice any type of flow. I think this book would be a great supplement to a cultural anthropology course but I don't think using it alone to study medical anthropology is the way to go.My rating has nothing to do with the content as I am not an academic and I am not in a position to judge the selections. My review is strictly based on my opinion of this text having used it in a class as an undergrad student. If you have no problem reading dry books, then you might actually like this book.

"I actually used this book as a textbook for a bioethics course. The book seems to cover most of the relevant issues regarding medical ethics but my issue with the book is that the language is just so hard to understand. For an intro book, I think the author should have ""dumbed it down"" a little considering the intended audience. Instead, his writing is very wordy instead of being straight and to the point and it reads like a boring textbook. I had to read each chapter two or three times to figure out what he was trying to say. It should be noted that Tony Hope is English so he is writing from a British perspective and you will see a lot of British references like the NHS.I don't understand why some authors decide to write in a complicated fashion when they can certainly use fewer words to make the same point.I had to give the book three stars because it's a pain to read. Maybe this is how British people write but I found it to be too wordy.For the price, I don't think it's a bad deal but I'm sure you could find a better medical ethics book.Borrow it first.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R89MS8I16XE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0192802828#wasThisHelpful","R2R89MS8I16XE4","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not my first book on managing finances.  I have read Dave Ramsey's books and also several others so I am familiar with the message.  What attracted me to this book is the title which suggests that the author may introduce us to some new ideas. After reading the book, I didn't learn anything that I haven't already heard.The book itself is short with big print.  You can finish it within an hour or less.  In some ways I would say that the brevity is a good thing because it keeps your attention till the end.  With a much larger book, you might not finish it if you get bored with it or if you just don't like reading bigger books.  The author does say that he chose to keep the book short for this reason so I can't hold it against him.Basically, the message of the book is that debt is bad, possessions are bad, money is time, marketing tries to separate you from your money, how to create a basic budget, and a few other topics.  Again, nothing new here.I actually enjoyed the first eight chapters but I wasn't a big fan of the author's budget in chapter 10.  I like Dave Ramsey's plan from his book ""The Total Money Makeover"" better. Actually, budgeting is a very personal thing; you should create a budget that works for you not something that works for someone else.It was also nice to read a book that emphasized the idea that spending makes you a slave to your money and that possessions are a prison.  Sometimes when I see people who buy cars, fancy clothes, electronics, and other things, I automatically assume that they must have lots of money to afford those things.  This book helped emphasize the point that many of those people may be ""all flash and no cash"" or as the author puts it...""big hat, no cattle"" (from page 48). So just because other people are buying iPads, BMW's, or other luxuries, that doesn't necessarily mean that they are doing better than you and that you should buy the same things; They might just be victims of the ""GMM.""One part of the book that I don't agree with is that the author suggests that you close your credit cards (after you have paid them off of course) to avoid the temptation of spending.  The idea may be the most sensible but when you factor in the damage that it will do to your credit score, I can't believe he would suggest such an idea.  You should pay off your credit cards and then just shred them or hide them.  Closing them is a very dumb move as it lowers your credit to debt ratio.Other than that, I thought it was a great introduction to the subject but nothing more than an introduction. Because books cost money and you are not supposed to waste your money, I have to give it three stars for the content.  I will give anybody who writes a book about personal finance five stars for effort because debt really is slavery and everybody needs to be educated on how to get their finances in order so that they can experience freedom.In the end, personal finance is not a science nor is it only understood by really smart people or the wealthy; it is simply common sense and discipline.  If you don't change those habits that are getting you into debt, then you will always run into debt and you will never get ahead.  If we all had the discipline to live within our means, we wouldn't even need to read books like this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TO9UJ2D506R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0978545702#wasThisHelpful","R1TO9UJ2D506R","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was actually looking at the Stanley Bostitch B310HDS heavy duty stapler when I came across this Swingline model.  I actually thought the Stanley looked more appropriate for heavy duty work but I ended up choosing the Swingline model because it came with 500 staples.I am so happy that I purchased this model because it is more than enough for my needs.  I'm usually stapling stacks of PowerPoint class notes which are about 20-30 pages thick and a regular stapler can't handle that kind of load. When I first used this stapler to staple a stack of 25 pages, the staple went right through the stack like a hot knife through butter.  The stapler itself is very ergonomic and the movement is effortless and requires very little force.  I was actually surprised how fluid the motion was because the stapler doesn't really look heavy duty to me. It actually looks only slightly bigger than some other desk staplers albeit about an inch or two longer.  It also looks great on my desk.  The Stanley Bostitch and other heavy duty models are much larger and look cumbersome on your desk.You will still need a regular stapler when stapling only a few sheets together as the heavy duty staples don't staple flat when used to staple only a few sheets.Overall, this stapler is a great buy at a great price and it COMES WITH 500 STAPLES.  One thing I want to point out is that in the picture there is a ""purple"" colored part at the head of the stapler but in reality it really is a ""bright red.""  The metal construction is great, it has a non-skid base plate, and the handle really is designed to increase leverage.If you need a heavy duty stapler to staple 20-40 pages, then this is your best bet.  I think the other bigger heavy duty models are more appropriate for stapling giant stacks of paper reaching 100 pages or more.  For the average person, this should be more than enough.Highly Recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IIB9BOERDGWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IFLA#wasThisHelpful","R3IIB9BOERDGWL","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a decent book and it's also very easy to read.  Just don't expect to find anything here that you can't find in any Intro to Management text.  All the strategies described in this book relate one way or another to some topic that you will be taught in an undergraduate introductory management course.  There is no strategy in this book that is only specific to Dell.The book is divided into two parts for a total of 15 chapters.  The first part which covers chapters 1-7 discusses the inception of Dell Computers, a few of their early struggles, and then their rise to the top and their dominance.  The second part which covers chapters 8-15 discusses all of the business strategies that Dell has employed to get to where they are today.If you do not have a management background, you will love this book because all these ""strategies"" will be new to you.  If you have even a basic management background, then this book is really just for entertainment purposes because you will have already been exposed to the ""strategies"" discussed.I decided to give the book four stars because it is easy to read and it gives you a nice overview of applied management.  If you find management textbooks boring, this book should help put them into perspective and clarify the different principles. There is a lot of positivity in this book and I was looking for greater insight into the low points or conflicts that Dell encountered over the years and how they overcame them. It does talk about one or two low points early on but nothing from the most recent years. The way the book is written, you would get the impression that Dell just rose to the top of the computer industry in a linear fashion but I'm sure there were many challenges or dips along the way and I wish Michael Dell would have talked more about them and how Dell's strategies helped them overcome those obstacles. I guess I was looking for the book to be a little more in depth than it is.I think this is still a great business book and it can only help you to be a better manager and it can only help your company. It is also a great read for business students.I recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTMDLBE3TU67R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060845724#wasThisHelpful","RTMDLBE3TU67R","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The material of the coat feels very cheap. It does not feel soft like a good quality peacoat should. I have a Macy's Ralph Lauren peacoat that I am returning because it is too big but it is much softer and higher quality than this one and I bought it for the same price on sale. The material on this coat feels like ""synthetic wool."" It does not have the same feeling that a good quality wool coat should have. The material on this coat actually can get wrinkles if you fold it!The bib on the inside also looks and feels cheap and it does not feel good on your neck as it feels itchy.I literally tried this on for two minutes and then I packed it up to return it.Just trust me on this one. If you are looking for a real peacoat, this is not it. It doesn't even look like a Kenneth Cole product. It is just a cheap peacoat with a Kenneth Cole tag. Buy another peacoat or spend a little more and buy better quality. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for.EDIT: After a little bit of shopping, I ended up buying a Polo Academy peacoat from Lord & Taylor which I got for 60% off retail.  This new coat is world's different from the crappy Kenneth Cole coat.  Not only is the material and craftsmanship on another level but the coat looks like a real peacoat as far as fit and cut.  Even thought I paid double what this Kenneth Cole coat is going for, you are getting a coat that is in a different league and will never go out of style.

The language was easy to understand, very engaging, the layout and structure are excellent and it does not read like a dry textbook.  Actually I have seen magazines that are bigger than this book.

If you can buy the book used, just do that.We went through the whole book over the course of 15 weeks and each topic of discussion was fresh and interesting.  After taking the course and reading this book, I can honestly say that cultural anthropology has opened my mind to be sensitive to other cultures and the way they do things.  You won't forget the material like you will in some other courses.  The information you learn in this course will stay with you long after your last class.I also had an awesome professor who did a lot of group work and supplemented our lectures with relevant videos so I'm sure that played a major role in why I liked the class and this book.If you want to self-study cultural anthropology, this would also be a great book to use.

Keep in mind that some other companies sell a similar towel and I'm sure it performs just as well.

They also leave behind lint no matter how many times you try to ""season"" the towel. Then I used a product called the ""Absorber."" I think it is a synthetic chamois but I just grew tired of it. This drying towel is superior to any other drying product for a few reasons.1. The waffle-weave design is perfect for absorbing water and not introducing new swirl marks.2. It has hand pockets sewn in so moving it around your paint is easy.3. It's big enough that one towel will dry a medium sized car in no time.4. It's very efficient; it cuts your drying time down considerably.My advice regarding using this towel is to make sure that you do a final rinse of your car with a flat stream of water so that most of the water sheets off.  Don't try to dry a car that has too much water already on the surface as the towel can only absorb so much.  Just remember to do that final rinse and this towel will work 10x better. Also, you might be tempted to dry off some dirty parts of your car like the windshield cowel but don't do it. Don't stain this towel.  Use this towel only on the painted surfaces and then use the Griot's door jamb towel for dirty spots.  Do your best to keep this towel clean.  I have never washed this towel since 2003 because it never got dirty and I just air dry it after every use.I liked this towel so much that I bought two.  If they ever discontinue it, I don't know what else I would use.Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29I6G07PMI92E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00449AC9C#wasThisHelpful","R29I6G07PMI92E","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been detailing my car since 1995.  I've used quite a few wheel cleaners during my time and this is probably my favorite.It is my favorite because it does the job well and it doesn't suffer from any of the negative aspects of some other wheel cleaners.Griot's Wheel Cleaner is not a spray-on hose-off product.  With this product, you spray it on, agitate it, and then hose it off.  Griot's includes a yellow sponge with your order which is nice.  Personally, I recommend buying their lambskin wheel mitt as it is more effective.  I actually use this product with Griot's short-handle boar's hair brush and I finish up with one of the green three-finger detail mitts.  I don't like any other detail tools for the wheels.  Griot's sells a stiff foam brush with a black handle. I've used that and it is ineffective and a waste of money.The Griot's Wheel Cleaner obviously removes the brake dust effectively.  The reason why I like it is because...1.  It doesn't have a strong chemical smell.2.  It does not irritate your skin.3.  I believe it is also environmentally friendly4.  It doesn't damage any painted surfaces both inside your wheel well and on your car.Here are some of my tips to make this product work effectively...First, always work on a cool wheel. Then, spray just enough product on the wheel so that the mist coats the whole wheel.  There is no need to waste product.  Now here is the trick, make sure when you start to agitate the wheel with either the boar's hair brush or another brush or mitt that the tool is dripping wet.  Don't use a dry tool on the wheel as it will just soak up the Wheel Cleaner and work ineffectively.  The extra water helps lather up the wheel.  Do one wheel at a time and work quickly with fast movement. Then hose the wheel down and follow up with a green detail mitt if anything is left behind.  The key to the Wheel Cleaner is to get good lather.This is one of my favorite products from Griot's Garage. I've actually never used P21S wheel cleaner because of the price and shipping charges.  I've heard some people say that the Griot's product works just as well if not better.  IMO, I don't see how a wheel cleaner could work any better than this product. The only wheel cleaner that I ever liked that was sold in an auto parts store was the Turtle Wax wheel cleaner because it was non-alkali based.  If I was desperate for a wheel cleaner, I would use that.  If I had choices, the Griot's Wheel Cleaner would be my first.Griot's now makes several other wheel cleaners for specific wheel types.  I think the Wheel Cleaner is a great general purpose wheel cleaner and you will be very happy with it. 35oz should last you a good while depending on how much you wash your car and if you use it conservatively. If you have a car that suffers from heavy brake dust and you like to keep your wheels clean, then you probably should invest in the gallon size. Griot's now makes a foaming sprayer and I just might pick that up as it seems more appropriate for this product than a misting sprayer.I highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39HUPYMZW5FRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NG7R2S#wasThisHelpful","R39HUPYMZW5FRG","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used this product since 2003. I actually don't use it anymore for automobiles.  I only keep an 8oz bottle so that I can clean up my drum set.  Yes, my drum set.This product has several limitations.1.  It is too ""wet"" and does not have enough lubricity.2.  The product goes bad pretty fast.  After sitting on your shelf, the product constantly separates and even if you shake it up, it doesn't work or look like it did when it was new.3.  Can only be used with Griot's clay, you will damage your paint if you use this as a lubricant with most other clay bars.Speed Shine does not have enough lubricity or cleaning power to be used as a true instant detailer/clay lube.  The product is very ""wet"" and it should be more slippery.  When you spray it on your paint, it tends to run instead of cling.  If you have bird droppings or some other contaminants, I found the cleaning power to be on the weak side. The consistency looks something like ""watered-down"" milk when it should look like regular milk.Speed Shine is also is a terrible lubricant. It manages to work with Griot's clay but it is not compatible with most other brands of clay.  I used it with Meguiar's medium clay and I nearly damaged the paint on my car. I thought the clay was the problem but it was the Speed Shine.  My paint had clay streaks and it just looked messed up.  Luckily I didn't do more than half of the hood so I managed to clean up the mess. Even with Griot's clay, Speed Shine just seems too weak.Another problem I noticed is that the Speed Shine seems so unstable.  The product seems to separate if you don't agitate it every other day.  I had a bottle that was a year old and the product literally separated and I could not shake it up and mix the blue with the clear liquid.I am very disappointed with Speed Shine.  It is the only Griot's product that I don't like.  I only have an 8oz bottle and I use it to clean my drum set and other misc. items around the house that need a quick shine.  I would never use this on my car.  There are so many other instant detailers on the market today and most of these will perform better than the Speed Shine.  Personally I use a commercial product manufactured by Hi-Temp called Clay Lube.  It is even the same color as Speed Shine. It addresses each and every one of Speed Shine's shortcomings and I am very happy with it.  Meguiar's Instant Detailer and Mothers Instant Detailer are also fine products.  Since Griot's products are really more for special rides, perhaps Speed Shine would be more appropriate for an already clean car that only has some dust and fingerprints.  I don't like Speed Shine for daily drivers.I don't recommend this product.  Buy another instant detailer.Tip:  As with any quick detailer and/or clay, always make sure you are working on a cool surface.  These products are not designed for working in the sun.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FHRHCUTM2TT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042KL8BY#wasThisHelpful","R1FHRHCUTM2TT0","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually own the older yellow model.I understand the newer model has an upgraded grill and can measure the appropriate amount of car wash.That's fine and it certainly is an improvement over the model that I have but the two units still look the same and suffer from one big problem.That problem is that they are too big to be used effectively as wash buckets. They are light when they are empty but once you fill them with six gallons of water, they become quite cumbersome. Just picture a steep driveway and a runaway bucket with six gallons of water! Luckily my yellow model does not have the casters so I don't have to picture that scenario. But then again, I can't move the bucket around easily because it is heavy.I personally use a standard Rubbermaid bucket to wash my car and I use this Ultimate Car Wash Bucket to store my detailing brushes. I tried to wash my car with this bucket a few times but I just found using a standard old bucket to be more effective. In the end, car washing is not a science, you don't need grit guards and all this fancy stuff. I mean what is a grit guard going to do for you? Some debris will still make their way to the good water.As a storage bucket, it's great and it holds all my long-handled brushes and small brushes. I am happy with the product because it solves another problem for me in that it holds a lot of my detailing supplies.I'll give it three stars because it's an awkward wash bucket but a great storage bucket. Considering the price, I'm sure you could find a better alternative for either use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BZYM4RM0GT64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00469HOOG#wasThisHelpful","R2BZYM4RM0GT64","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been an avid detailing enthusiast since 1995 and I have been using Griot's products exclusively since 2003. Overall I like their products and they have certainly met my expectations.  I have been using Spray-on Wax for several years now and I will offer you my take on this specific product.First, it smells like bananas.  Seriously, I enjoy spraying the car because it makes the air smell like bananas. It's even yellow like a banana.You have to understand what this product is and what it isn't. Don't buy it thinking that it is a true spray-on wax.  This product can either be used as a high gloss enhancer or a base-wax enhancer.  If you have a coat of wax already on your car, after you wash the car, you spray this product on while the car is still wet and then dry it. The ""base-wax"" then becomes enhanced or rejuvenated.  If your car is not waxed, you can also use this product to enhance the gloss and you should get some basic protection and ""slipperyness"" for a few days.This product has to be applied to a freshly washed car that is already wet.  Do not try to apply this to a dry car as you will get streaks.  I've generally avoid spraying on glass and plastic but during application some mist does get on these surfaces and I have not noticed any streaking.  Of course, the final step for me is to clean the windows with glass cleaner so if there is any streaking, the glass cleaner will take it away.  I highly recommend you use this product with their waffle-weave drying towel.  Actually, I think this product works best with that towel as it not only dries the car faster but it spreads the wax around uniformly without any lint.  I no longer dry my cars with cotton towels as they don't work as well as microfiber IMO. Also the waffle-weave microfiber towel cuts drying time in half as you just simply have to go over the paint with one pass and it absorbs all the water.  Cotton products tend to streak and they always leave behind lint.I'll give the product 4 stars simply because it is rather expensive.  Griot's sells you 35oz with no sprayer and the 35oz gets used up faster than you would think.  Also, Griot's is still mail-order for the most part so you can't just buy this one product alone; you usually have to buy a few items to make the shipping worthwhile. I'd give it five stars if it was more economical and had more protection. (EDIT: As of 10/25/11, Griot's still has FREE SHIPPING).As far as durability, I personally use this as a gloss enhancer and I can get a few days of shine on a freshly WASHED car.  This is demonstrated by the fact that the water will still bead up after a few days. To save money, when my car is already waxed, I don't apply this product as the base wax is much stronger than this. Other than that, Spray-on Wax is no substitute for a monthly or bi-monthly wax job.  The only thing that I wish Griot's would change is that I wish they could ""juice"" this Spray-on Wax up as well as their Speed Shine.  I want more protection from this product and I want more durability from the Speed Shine. In other words, I would like to use the Speed Shine as a gloss enhancer and the Spray-On Wax as a true spray-on wax.Griot's products are really for garage-kept vehicles and show cars, I think they are overkill for daily drivers.  In the next year, I am planning on switching back to Meguiar's or Mothers due to price. Also I have had a few quality control issues with Griot's bottles and sprayers that are kind of annoying.I have no problem recommending Griot's products though. The Spray-on Wax is a good product when used correctly and I think you will like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7TP4KV05QW8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002E02H7I#wasThisHelpful","R7TP4KV05QW8G","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've actually been using this for the past few years with my Nuvi 760.  I did not like the position or the ""ring"" of the window mounts.  Also the window mounts will mount the GPS so far from you that you cannot operate it while driving and because it is farther away from you, the screen looks even smaller.This vent mount is built really well, it is not bulky, and it looks great.  It mounts the GPS in the best possible position for you to clearly view the screen as well as operate the screen while driving (when you are at a stop of course.)The only thing I would change on this unit is that I wonder if they could engineer it to mount/dismount a lot quicker.  You have to manually depress the clips to hook them to your vent and then depress them again to remove the unit.  I wish there was a way just to hook and unhook in one movement as it makes it easier to move from car to car.  To solve the ""wobble"" problem just make sure that the hinge is mounted to the lowest possible vent fin that you can use.  If the hinge is mounted to a vent fin that is higher up, you will get more wobble as it is not as stable. Also the ball mount is not fluid at all, you need to use both hands to adjust the tilt of the screen.  For the price, I don't think you could expect more.Other than that, I don't know of a better way to mount a GPS unit in your car.  My review is more like 4.5 stars.  I have to deduct that one star because after a while, install/removal does became a chore.I would buy this again in a second and I would recommend it to anybody.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM4BMBEJVD05I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015A6YN6#wasThisHelpful","RM4BMBEJVD05I","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just developed an interest in gardening and this was one of the tools that I needed for my project.I bought this same tool at Home Depot for the same price.  The unit seems well-built and has the desirable squared tines. The ergonomics are also good, and it did everything I wanted it to do.  I might have even over-abused the unit by trying to get under some heavy weeds and raise them.  The handle stood up to this abuse with no signs of giving or stress.  The only problem I have is that the plastic D-handle has now become loose.  Not really loose but it definitely is not tight anymore.  I think the hole where the metal rod goes through in the wood has become enlarged due to the constant up and down pressure that I placed on it.  There is no way I can tighten the handle because I believe it is riveted on.I used this tool to dig up and turn over a 20x4' area and this tool made quick work of the job. I was actually trying to do the job with a round-point shovel but I noticed it was taking too long. Once I bought this tool, the job was much easier.  I actually have all Ames garden tools and they seem to be of the same quality as this fork.If you are looking for a spading fork, I have no problem recommending this one. I just have to deduct one star because of the handle as I don't think it can be fixed and I don't think it should become loose even with the abuse I dealt it.Overall, this is a great tool at a reasonable price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ILFC96OMHOMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OMIJXE#wasThisHelpful","R1ILFC96OMHOMV","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book because I am a student and I will be taking Intro. to Financial Accounting this summer.  I just wanted a head start before the semester begins as I don't know anything about accounting.  This book was very easy to read and comprehend and I actually finished it in just two days.  If you have a whole day to spare, you can easily get through this in a day with extra time to spare!What I liked about this book was that it makes a point or a statement and then re-emphasizes that point or statement many times until you get it.  As a result, I did not get lost in this book.  There were one or two points that didn't make a whole lot of sense but I scored a 90% on the end of book test. Accounting sounds pretty boring but this book really did make it seem somewhat interesting.The writing is in big print and heavily spaced with color charts.  I would say it is engaging and the chapters are short so you don't get frustrated. The book is definitely not intimidating like a textbook.After reading the book, the accounting principles make sense to me and I can now understand why things are the way they are.  If anything, the fact that I learned that the ""Left side has to balance with the right side"" has helped me to understand the purpose of financial accounting. Also for a basic book, I was surprised that the book talked about prepaid expenses.  The prepaid expenses used as an example in this book will give you an understanding of the adjustment concept. This book also does get into FIFO and LIFO but again, it gives you the overall picture.  FIFO and LIFO in a textbook is much more in depth.This is by no means a full course in accounting.  I flipped through my school textbook and there are things in there that you won't learn here.  The purpose of this book is to give you the ""Big picture.""  I think after reading this book you will be less intimidated by accounting and you will feel comfortable learning it.The one part of the book that I wish they could change was that for certain charts, you have to constantly flip back to previous pages or chapters to get the information.  That's a little too tedious for me.I will try to update this review once I finish my class to let you know how much this book has ultimately helped me.Overall:I liked the book, I learned something, and I will recommend it.I'll give the book four stars just because I think the authors could have thrown in some extra material in the book without making it much harder and the fact that you still have to flip back to complete some of the charts.Other than that, the book is worth buying.EDIT: July 7, 2011.  It is now July and I have completed my Intro to Financial Accounting class.  I am happy to report that I received an A in the class. I can honestly say that this book played a part in that because I was prepared for the class before it started.  In my initial review I gave it four stars because I thought it was too basic.  I'm going to change my review to five stars because I think it is probably better that way.  If this book was harder, than you might get confused.  I think this book keeps it simple but gives you the main ideas that you need to really understand.  After reading this book, either take an accounting class or work through a textbook to understand all the other concepts.*****I want to strictly emphasize that this book is a great introduction to FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING ONLY. Managerial accounting is totally different.  This book has NOTHING to do with managerial accounting just in case you were wondering.*****Overall, highly recommended.EDIT: August 4, 2012.  After taking Intermediate I and II, I can tell you that this book is in every sense of the word only a ""basic"" introduction to accounting.  Once you get to Intermediate II where you are calculating leases, bonds, etc., you will begin to see how hard accounting really is.  I still highly recommend this book but just be aware that accounting is not just simple debits and credits like you see in this book.  Once you have to start calculating the debits and credits, that is actually real accounting --and it is not easy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CQ8WTGFIOK0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402211864#wasThisHelpful","R1CQ8WTGFIOK0N","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can get this same item at Home Depot for thirty five bucks.  The price is inflated on Amazon because they are going to get you for the shipping as this is a cumbersome item. So just stop by at Home Depot and pick this one up yourself.I needed a wheelbarrow for a gardening project that became bigger and messier than I expected.  I went to home depot and picked this one up because it was the cheapest one that they had.  It is sold (or shipped) in three parts.  You get a parts box which is not too big, the plastic bin itself, and the wooden handles.Setup was fairly easy and I did it by myself.  The only tool you will need is a 13mm socket.The unit looks really good and the plastic bin is pretty strong and I don't think it would crack unless you seriously go out of your way to compromise it.  I went ahead and loaded the bin to the brim with soil.  Moving the wheelbarrow was surprisingly pretty easy.  The wheel/tire can make or break a good wheelbarrow and the wheel on this unit is very good and navigates well through different terrain.  I didn't have a problem with wobbling, any sense of imbalance, or moving from grass to concrete. The wheel is of good quality and certainly makes using this model very easy. Unloading is pretty easy too with a fluid up and down motion.I did notice some flexing when fully loaded with heavy weight but then again I could have always made two trips.  I wouldn't load this wheelbarrow up with that much weight on a regular basis as I think you could possibly break the unit.  If I could change one thing, I would swap the plastic ""levelers"" (those black things that keep the red plastic bin level.)  I would swap them with metal pieces because that would make the wheelbarrow at least twice as strong.  The plastic ""leveler"" things are the weakest link on this wheelbarrow and if they crack or become loose, you would be in trouble as the whole unit will be rendered useless. I had to deduct the one star because I think they could have given you those metal parts without increasing the price too much.Overall, considering the price, I have no problem recommending the unit as it will do the job. Until I bought this wheelbarrow, I didn't realize how much I needed one.  If you are planning on doing heavy-duty work or if you need a wheelbarrow for daily use, you probably should spend the extra money for a metal unit.  Other than that, for gardening and occasional heavy usage, this unit is a great buy. It also looks good too!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HR05LME1LWU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009GZA4G#wasThisHelpful","R1HR05LME1LWU2","A36E8TYZM3OW4S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36E8TYZM3OW4S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I take pretty good care of myself to begin with. I thought this book would go above and beyond the most basic of grooming and hygiene and teach me some tricks I don't know. I was wrong.This book is small and the advice given is very basic. You are probably doing most of the stuff here already. I actually got the impression that this book was intended for slobs or people who have little to no manners or sense of style.The only part of the book that I found interesting was the natural deodorant recipe because you could spray it on your whole body. But then again, you could find this on the internet somewhere. Other than that, I know how to wash my face, trim my nose hairs, shave my pubes, get a haircut, check for bad breath, and wipe my mouth after I eat. After about a few pages, I knew this book was not going in the right direction for me. After I finished it, I didn't come away with any tips which were that much different than my current grooming habits.This book gets one star because of the high price to useful information ratio. The advice contained in this book could easily be added as a chapter in a book on ""Manners for men"" or any other ""Men's style book."" I'm not trying to knock the author for his efforts, it's just that the title leads you to believe one thing but the book delivers something totally different. Honestly if you want grooming secrets, all you have to do is subscribe to a men's magazine or just talk to your girlfriends and even your fellow guy friends.I found a USED copy on eBay for 99 cents. I actually decided to sell it back because it was not something I would keep on my bookshelf.Take my advice, you can pass on this title; it's not an ultimate guide to anything. Just flip through some men's magazines and you'll be good.  Or better yet, get a girlfriend and she can give you some advice for free.  Do not buy this book to meet women.Also beware of the five star reviews on this site as they are from the author.

"The 2015 OxyLED BTL-10 Rechargeable LED Bicycle light is reasonably priced and offers multi-mode red LED rechargeable bicycle safety light functions with both red rear facing LEDs and down facing red bike""safety Lane/line""  LEDs. With a full charge the bike light operated for ~four hours with both light features operating in rapid flashing mode.Light Mode Details: The light has eight (8) rear-facing LEDs and two (2) laser safety line projectors, each controlled by separate buttons. The multi-modes  (controlled by additional successive button pushes) includes solid eight LED on, flashing 8 LEDs on, multi-pattern three LEDs flashing. The laser line safety line LEDs offers solid on, slow, or fast flash modes via a separate switch.Recharging details: A two-prong wall outlet mount 120v to USB power adapter with power LED and USB-to-mini plug power cord is included (see as-opened review photo) view) to recharge this Li-Ion battery powered light. There is no ""charge complete"" feature in the system. The light comes with a one-year warranty. Specs indicate an internal 1000 mAh 3.7V 14500-type (~AA sized)  Li-Ion battery.Mounting details: The thumb screw bracket plastic mount required no tools for mounting/removal of the bracket and allows for easy mounting and removal of the light. A retaining clip on the mount, makes a positive lock with the slide on-off bike light. The mount will accommodate a seat/ frame tube as small as ~23mm up to 34mm and allows for pivot adjustment to horizontal orientation for proper light projection. The mount is of moderate strength construction - recommend being gentle/careful with it.The safety lane/laser lines are a nice idea but bright vehicle headlights would likely wash out the thin LED lines so they are not likely visible to drivers from a distance. They look great from the bike in the dark, and would be visible to pedestrians other nearby bicyclists at night.The case has a has a solid precision made look and is finished with a flat black rubberized finish. The finish or case edges may get marred if you carry the light unprotected in a tool bag or drop the light on rough pavement. Because it has an LED element design, vice fragile less efficient incandescent bulbs, it should withstand vibrations and small drops well.Disclosure: this product was received as an evaluation unit for review purposes from vendor hisgadget.com and is available for purchase on Amazon.com, with Prime shipping available. We have purchased other OxyLED products and they have worked well for us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAEQBGU7K0V0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWH0A7M#wasThisHelpful","RAEQBGU7K0V0C","A1XYOVJW5J06X5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XYOVJW5J06X5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Find a new home for your tiny 1 amp USB chargers they just don't have the power capacity need by larger smart phones or iPad tablets. With today's larger smart phones (""phablets"")  and mini-tablets the old 1 amp low watt USB cube charger adapters simply do not put out enough power to properly or quickly charge these larger devices, and many larger cube adapters have only one 2.4 amp port, and can only charge one high demand  item at a time. This can charge two 2.4 amp devices simultaneously.The attractively priced well built iClever 2.4 amp  x2 (4.8 amp) USA 2 prong 120VAC 24 watt dual cube is the size of an OEM Apple iPad/tablet  USB power adapter and has soft blue (unobtrusive) LED lighting inside the USB ports to let you know it's properly connected in the wall outlet. It can charge two high-demand (2.4 amp) devices at the same time. It is available in black or white housing color.This SmartID power adapter cube (allows safe rapid charging for devices that support this tech) charged a large Samsung Galaxy ""phablet"" smart phone and an iPhone 6 Plus easily. The fit and finish is smooth and precise. The fold-able power prongs function smoothly as they disappear into the housing for travel transport in your pocket, a briefcase or a suitcase, and appears very solid mechanically.

"CREE XM-L2 generation element. This is a nicely made/well finished premium LED flashlight. Very bright high output light 920 lumens in turbo with 18650 Li-Ion, and 1000 lumens w/2xCR123A batteries. Has a claimed 160 meter/525 foot beam range. 2 to 720 hour battery life based upon brightness high through moonlight. Claimed waterproof to IPX-7 (1 meter depth).Nice product but not a huge value so gets a 4 (pretty darn good) vice 5 (wow!) star rating. Warranty: 30 day return to original retailer, and 5 year repair/replacement warranty from Olight Technology Co. Shenzhen, China not sure how practical that would/will be. There is a USA Olight site at http://www.olightusa.com but it was down for maintenance at the time of this review.The vertical (standing) USB connector powered magnetic charging stand (750 mA rate) with USB pass through is convenient/effective and does not require battery removal. Charging stand LED glows red when flashlight in in position and turns green when charging is complete.Not having the typical end-cap on-off switch (has a magnetic charging mount)  does require some use adaptation techniques, we use the pocket clip mounted 180 (other side) from the side located on-off switch position as a ""locate by feel"" reference point. Memorizing the button click pattern to get to all the modes (brightness and strobe) takes some deliberate thought, but is not difficult. Has a nice battery saving low moonlight setting (claimed 720 hours), and also a ""memory"" position.Our Olight package included a 18650 battery, a belt holster, a 12volt auto USB power adapter, and two bonus night light LED light sticks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GYUD7IG7R6YQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QBP8W7Q#wasThisHelpful","R1GYUD7IG7R6YQ","A1XYOVJW5J06X5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XYOVJW5J06X5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Complete kit, screen digitizer high quality no issues, good quality tools. We were worried by the quality control issues/poor reviews of the lower priced screen replacement-only screen parts on Amazon. The instruction booklet was very thorough and the magnetized tools were a higher quality than previous iPhone tool kits we have purchased vis Amazon/others. Highly recommend the ""splunger"" tool set available elsewhere on Amazon.Over the years, I've replaced two iPhone 4 screens, Li-Ion cell batteries, one iPhone 5 screen, and a power supply in an old iMac all-in-one flat panel desktop that Apple no longer supports/services - great fun.It is within the capability of nearly any patient semi-technically adept person with good eyesight (the screws are TINY)  to replace a cracked screen or replace the Li-Ion battery in an iPhone 5/4.Replacing the screen in the 5/ / 5s is MUCH easier than the previous generation iPhone 4 which was opened from the back. The iPhone 5 is opened from the front. Give yourself 45 minutes to an hour to accomplish the task in a clean well lighter area.

"Excellent USA made OEM substitute. Replace these struts in pairs (qty two).  Simple ""two minute"" install. Get a narrow tip flat head screwdriver to release old strut's retaining clips. Procedure: While holding up the hood, on one side loosen old strut's retaining clips and pull off old strut from two ball pivot pins, match positioning of new strut as the old one was, snap in new strut on both pivot balls, repeat on other side.Basically after ~12 years our original nitrogen hood struts on the F-350 simply pooped out as these struts will do after a decade plus. The old ones would just barely hold the heavy hood up on a warm day, but  not in the cool of evening/night. We've read of folks getting thwacked on the head by a falling hood. Didn't happen to us but we were not going to take a chance...These struts are made in U.S.A. by AVM Industries Inc. in Marion County, South Carolina.

"We had several 3.7v 18650 Li-Ion batteries that needed homes and bought these flashlights-only  for them. These larger flashlights are longer battery-life companions to the convenient, powerful and smaller AA sized 14500 Li-Ion powered flashlights available via Amazon Prime.Brightness: The CREE LED OEM website site lists the output of their single XM-L T6 LED element at 1,040 lumens (at 10 Watts maximum, driven at 3 amps maximum.These Cree XM-L T6 element based flashlights are bright (~1050 lumens) and the 18650 batteries have greater capacity/ a longer life than the smaller 14500's. The flashlights are MUCH better than the Techlite 3-Pack 3-AAA Alkaline powered flashlights sold by Costco because they do not have the annoying shelf-storage battery drain-down problem the Techlites have.  After replacing AAA batteries every ~6 months we're simply done with those.The 18650's are a loose fit but our flashlights came with a plastic tube sheath that prevented 18650 battery from rattling in the tube. These come with a triple AAA battery adapter cartridge (3x1.5v=4.5v)  to you can use conventional (AKA primary) batteries if necessary/ desired.Size: Size wise, these fit nicely/comfortable in the average size man's palm (4"" across) but are NOT the diminutive size of a 14500-based Cree LED flashlights that fit so nicely and unobtrusively in a pants pocket or small purse. Weight wise, the 18650 based units weigh about 2.6 times the weight of the smaller AA/14500 sized LED flashlights.Dimensions & Weight: To be specific, these larger single-cell 18650 units are 6.85 oz 1.5"" in diameter and 5.5"" long, much larger and heavier (relatively) than the 2.6 oz 1"" in diameter, 3.5"" long 14500-cell units (weights are with a Li-Ion cell installed).Modes: While we generally prefer the simplicity of operation of single-mode (on-off) LED flashlights, these units feature a fully acceptable and unobtrusive 5-mode operation. Full single-click button actuations will bring the flashlight to life in ""the last mode used."" Partial actuations with subtle releases will cycle through the modes - high , medium, low, flashing/strobe, and finally SOS (Morse Code).We have seen videos on the Internet that claim that counterfeit/clone/bogus UtraFires do not support ""the last mode used"" memory function described above. These did - so they must be ""authentic"" UtraFire units.Focus: The focus function of these flashlights is also a nice feature. The broad beam gives a uniform and comfortable lighting area suitable for trail walking, or illuminating a night-time work area.Water Resistance: These units are splash/rain resistant but are not 100% waterproof because there is no O-ring seal behind the front strike bezel or in the area of the LED circuit board mount. It is also unknown if there is a O-ring in the Lens head zoom mechanism. There is clearly an O-ring seal at the screw-on base cap. We would not recommend giving these a full-immersion/dunk test.Again, great value and performance for the price. Amazon Prime shipping is a plus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G9SC3MFQSR1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRAZ7ZG#wasThisHelpful","R3G9SC3MFQSR1J","A1XYOVJW5J06X5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XYOVJW5J06X5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a large, Made in USA belt drive floor fan/air circulator.

Has a 2-year warranty.This unit arrived in excellent condition (its a large box, this is a 42"" diameter fan) but that depends upon the shipper's handling of the item. If the fan/its box is subjected to rough handling or sustains box damage in shipment it is very likely the fan inside will be damaged or bent because there is little padding or packing material around the drum body - so immediately upon delivery, inspect yours carefully and plug it in and operationally check it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SOO1X0AWJCVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JQJHR2#wasThisHelpful","R1SOO1X0AWJCVX","A1XYOVJW5J06X5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XYOVJW5J06X5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Setting up wireless IPCAMS is always a chore. These FOSCAM FI8905 units work well as outdoor nightime illuminated cameras. They slightly more costly than the nearly-identical to the Agasio 603W that served us well for ~5 years until the wireless (RF) side went bad. Apparently FOSCAM USA (Texas) and Agasio USA have merged or at least have a business relationship.These FOSCAM/Agasio units  have a slightly wider than normal 73 degree field of view and significantly better nightime IR illumination that is bright and effective than the older slightly smaller Asgsio M105I camera.WRT IR illumination, these cameras are not/do not have the newer/more expensive invisible ""black"" 930-940nm (nanometer) type IR LED illuminators so they do have a red glow (780-850NM) that is visible to humans and animals at night. Some customers believe cameras should be seen at night, others prefer the stealth of the ""black"" IR illuminators.Note the FOSCAM uses standard SMA connectors on their products and not the Reverse Polarity SMA connectors more common on other products - you have non-FOSCAM IPCAM accessories (cables/antennas/amps) you will either need to use the FOSCAM OEM antennas that come with the FOSCAM cameras, buy FOSCAM antennas, or get standard to RP SMA adapters of the appropriate gender to use your existing cables/antennas/WiFi amps.

"The Tin Snail is one of those stories where something that actually happened in history is turned into a children's book, where a child, who never actually existed in real life, becomes a hero.  Personally,  I don't think it's a good idea to create such stories, because it's teaching fake history to children. But this story has enough real history in it, plus incredibly intense feelings about what happened when the German army rolled into France, that I can't help but think it's an exceptional children's book.Our young hero, thirteen-year-old Angelo, is living in Paris in the 1930s with his Italian parents.  His father is a car designer, but is in need of a new design.  Angelo desperately wants to help his father, because things seem to be falling apart in their family, and comes up with the idea for a new type of car. The car is created, but ends up destroyed, thanks to Angelo.  There are lots of vehicle crashes and wild rides in this book, which makes it seem very much like a children's book for young car enthusiasts.  Yet, after Angelo then comes up with the idea for the Tin Snail, which in real life was the Citron 2CV, and they have to keep the car out of the hands of the invading Nazis, the story no longer seems only for young children.  In fact, I'm not sure why it's not being suggested for teenagers, too.  I'm not sure it wouldn't be too intense for 9-year-olds.  Angelo's fears of what the Nazis might do if they don't get what they want are very real.By the end of the story, I had forgotten my irritation about all the vehicle crashes, and my amusement that French and Italian individuals were often using British expressions.  Instead, I was thinking that I had just learned a pretty good history lesson, and had read a book with very well-developed characters. What started off seeming like a simple, if not often silly, children's story about cars, turned into a serious and complex story about life in France during the 1930s, that even adult readers could appreciate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GQRVAR0OR1FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553536389#wasThisHelpful","R3GQRVAR0OR1FH","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a lifelong Peanuts fan, I wish I had liked this book more than I did.  Its well researched and very readable, but I wasnt as interested in the main topic as I thought.  Author Stephen J. Lind covers both Charles Schulz personal religious beliefs, as well as how religion, particularly biblical references, appeared in the Peanuts comic strip, the TV specials and the movies.  In addition, he explores Mr. Schulzs personal life, particularly his family life; things I had never read elsewhere.  Interestingly, even though I remembered when he died, I also had never read much of anything about his illness, death or funeral, until now. (This was the second time I cried while reading a book in the last few months.)  What Charles Schulz was thinking and feeling, when he knew his illness was terminal, clearly showed you can spend your whole life, or most of it, thinking about God and faith, but still end up not totally knowing what is the meaning of life and death?(Note: I received a free e-copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3712DIJPBWUZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496804686#wasThisHelpful","R3712DIJPBWUZM","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Krusteaz is not as well known as Betty Crocker, Pillsbury and Duncan Hines, but, in my opinion, their mixes are a notch above those.  I baked this in a loaf pan, using cooking olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and the cake was delicious.  Just a small piece will satisfy anyone's craving for chocolate, and if you heat it up a little in the microwave before eating, the chocolate chips in the mix will be melted.  Watch out for the chips, though, after baking in the oven.  If you use a toothpick to see if the cake is done, you may hit a melted chocolate chip and think it needs more cooking, when it does not.  I baked it for 55 minutes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DJXQ5JK36TXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHNXSEO#wasThisHelpful","R3DJXQ5JK36TXD","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It unfortunately doesn't work for a 6"" Fire at all, since this is a hard shell case and the Fire must be snapped in to keep it from sliding out while reading.  So, three stars for a neutral rating.

This is a good tree for playful cats, too, which mine don't usually seem to be these days.  I guess playing is for the younger cats and kittens.  They love to sit and sleep on the cat trees, though. So, with this one, they have to go all the way up to the top perch, which gives them climbing exercise.  They also love to do their nails on the sisal posts.

Not all the humor was great, mind you; like most contemporary quirky novels, some of it was juvenile and tasteless. Nevertheless, there were enough laughs, as well as enough major happenings, to keep the novel afloat.  In addition, there were enough subtle reminders throughout the story about the human need for families and fathers to make much of what was happening seem downright important.

"Bosch probably had builders and other such professionals in mind when they released this item.  After reading all the warnings in the manual, you have to wonder if maybe it is best left in the hands of professionals, too, and not for those who simply want a swift and nifty way to measure things around the house.  The biggest warning is about the laser causing severe eye injury or blindness.  Hence, you should never stare into the laser beam or direct it towards any other living creatures, including children and pets.  Also, you should not point it at any reflective surface that might reflect the beam back to your eyes.  This of course means you really need to keep it out of the hands of young or disobedient children; as well as  have serious reservations about loaning it to an idiot relative, friend or neighbor who thinks product warnings are for sissies. (Update: Although according to online research, few people get eye damage from lasers, because the eye moves. But this laser 2 beam is stronger than the laser found in cat toys, which is usually laser 1, so don't let children play with it.)I'm going to leave all the wonderfully complex things this laser measure can do to professionals who write reviews, or amateurs who understand as much as the professionals, or to anyone who got better grades in geometry than I did.  What I've been using this Bosch for so far is measuring walls, measuring mailing boxes and measuring the distance between the garage door and the curb across the street, in case I get a surveillance camera one day.  I discovered using the ""real time"" measuring function with the target cards is the easiest way for a math challenged person to measure.  It's also a lot of fun.  You just put or hold the target card where you want it, point the laser at it, and there you have the length, width or distance.  Measuring the distance across the street was the most fun.  In just a minute or so, I realized the surveillance camera I looked at that shot up to 65' was not good enough.  Standing four feet away from the garage door, it was 84' and 6 inches to the curb across the street.It would have taken me much longer to get that measurement without this Bosch, since I have no measuring stick/tape longer than 7 feet.  So, this would be a very useful item around the house.  (Two other things you can use it for is to quickly determine how much paint or carpet you would need for a room.)  I did not try the Bluetooth function yet, since I do not have a Smart phone, but you cannot use this laser with Bluetooth  ""in the vicinity of gas stations, chemical plants, areas where there is danger of explosion and areas subject to blasting""; as well as in airplanes; or in ""the vicinity of medical devices"", or operate ""in the direct vicinity of the human body over longer periods of time"".  I'm not researching that warning online.

"After recently reading The Witch of Lime Street: Sance, Seduction, and Houdini in the Spirit World, I wanted to read a little more about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  This biography seemed to fit the bill--it wasnt too long and author Michael Coren said in his introduction that his book was a biographical study, not an orthodox literary biography.  That suited me, since I was most interested in reading about Sir Arthurs personal life and his interest in spiritualism.  This book did indeed have quite a bit about those two topics, but also had quite a bit about Sir Arthurs mystery books and other writings that were not about spiritualism. That was okay, though, but I did skim most of the parts about Sherlock Holmes.Mr. Coren also mentioned in the books introduction a short video of Sir Arthur made in 1929, where he spends about five minutes talking about Sherlock Holmes and about five minutes discussing spiritualism.  You can easily find this video online and watch it.  Its an interesting film, and quite funny when he discusses Sherlock Holmes; because he tells about letters he gets addressed to the great detective, by readers who obviously dont know they are writing to a fictional character.  Many are from women asking Mr. Holmes if he needs a housekeeper.But back to the book  .  .  .  Mr. Coren does a good job describing Arthur Conan Doyles childhood in Scotland; education, including in a Jesuit school; trips to many countries;  family life, both as a child and as an adult;  writings, both fiction and nonfiction; speeches on about everything; involvement in political and social issues; interest in all types of sports; years as a doctor, including during the Boar War; intense interest in spiritualism; and final years before his death in the summer of 1930, at the age of 71.  There was less in the book about spiritualism than I wanted, but maybe that was for the best.  Sir Arthur was such an intelligent and accomplished man, and it seemed so odd he seemed so gullible about certain aspects of spiritualism, such as mediumship and psychic pictures, like the fairy ones.Personally, I think he was concentrating on the wrong metaphysical topic.  I think he would have been far better off studying and thinking about reincarnation, instead of trying to talk to the dead.  That could have both satisfied his need to believe in the existence of an afterlife, as well as his interest in history, including making sense of the oncoming war he so correctly feared was going to happen.  Moreover, just looking at, listening to and reading about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle makes me think there was a man who had lived many times before.  A man who had acquired much knowledge and experience during those lifetimes, which is why he was such an accomplished man in his lifetime as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.(Note: I received a free e-copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HLOA5KWXSU1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DJW8NI#wasThisHelpful","R1HLOA5KWXSU1A","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This epilator has 48 ""rotating tweezers"" compared to the 24 on the other Panasonic one I tried--the Panasonic ES-EU20-P Multi-Functional Wet/Dry Shaver and Epilator with Three Attachments and Travel Pouch.  Does having twice as many tweezers, as well as a dual-disc pivoting head, make much difference?  Yes, it does.  This Panasonic removed much more hair on the first try than the other single-disc non-pivoting one.  But it was also at least twice as painful than the other one.  I had to greatly limit the area being epilated on my leg.  (It's suppose to be less painful if using shower gel in the shower, and I will try that later on in the season when the warm weather is gone.)This model has more attachments, too, including a smaller epilator head for more sensitive areas like underarms.  I can't imagine, though, epilating underarms. As a shaver, this model works well like the other less expensive model, because it is exactly the same as that one. It does not pivot.  Do 48 tweezers justify the extra cost?  If you are seriously into epilating and want to remove as much hair as possible in a single swipe, yes.  It's faster and more efficient; although, as stated above, more painful.  If you think there is a good chance you may end up just using this Panasonic as an electric razor, however, save money and go with the other model. (Unless you want a shaver with a light, at which time you would need to get this one.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34E1K60S9JZ7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XN1PLHA#wasThisHelpful","R34E1K60S9JZ7Q","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a highly readable biography that left me with highly mixed feelings about Alex Haley.  He wrote two outstanding books during a time when black history wasnt exactly mainstream knowledge.  Reading about the first book, The Autobiography of Malcolm X: As Told to Alex Haley, was most interesting to me, far more interesting than reading about  Roots.  Reading about Alex Haley's second book was a bit distressful because it appears he did not write a great deal of the book.  Apparently, he was totally absorbed by the research, as well as other smaller projects, and had another man doing much of the writing.  There was also constant excuses from Haley about why the book was not finished, most of the excuses raving about how successful the book was going to be after it was published.  Fortunately for him, that proved to be true, especially since he kept asking for more advance money.Its important to note Mr. Haley  had huge financial problems at the time, which made him feel obligated to do smaller projects to get quick cash.  The IRS was after him, and he made very bad marriages.  Thats another cause of my mixed feelings--he obviously had major problems with women, starting with his mother and stepmother, and appeared to spend little time with his children.  He was always running off here or there, he said to research or write.  The irony of this is that Roots to him was not only the incredibly important telling of the story of so many black families, but specifically the story of his family.  Yet, he himself could not be seen as much of a family man, at least not where his wives or children were concerned.Roots, too, brought on some lawsuits, which is not at all unusual for a highly successful book.  One, involving plagiarism, though, appeared to be legitimate, considering similar texts found in both Roots and Harold Courlanders The African.  Another plagiarism case involved Margaret Walker Alexanders book Jubilee.  I found it quite interesting to read about that case since I recently read  Song of My Life: A Biography of Margaret Walker.  She did not seem like the type of person to falsely accuse another author of plagiarism.  In this biography, however, author Robert J. Norrell claims her charges were totally false, and were made strictly because of jealousy of the success of Roots.  I dont know if that was a fair charge by Mr. Norrell or not, but he struck me in this book as trying very hard to be fair.  Fair both to Alex Haley and to the readers of this book, by presenting an honest account of Mr. Haleys life, not a fan account; even though he has the highest regards for Roots and The Autobiography of Malcolm X: As Told to Alex Haley, and the tremendous impact both books had in the United States.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NZ2UTMNMGZAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137279605#wasThisHelpful","R3NZ2UTMNMGZAG","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Compared to a Remington epilator I have, this Panasonic is a lot less painful.  I don't know if it's because it works at a higher speed, or because I've been wearing shorts for 6 months and my legs seem ""tougher"".  I can epilate my legs with this Panasonic just as fast as I can shave my legs.  No, it doesn't get all the hairs, but neither does the Remington.  Also, the epilator head sometimes pops off!  The shaving head works as well as any excellent ladies' shaver, but it's never going to be as close as a razor.  While this Panasonic can be used in the shower, I'm not sure what the reasoning is for using an electric shaver/epilator in the shower, unless it makes epilating less painful.  I only intend to use it dry, and will try this time to stick with epilating long enough to see if it's worth the extra time and attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B8DHCHF8HQH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XN1PQIE#wasThisHelpful","R3B8DHCHF8HQH5","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I put off getting a Kindle for years, because I've never really liked reading e-books, which I've done for years with Kindle on my PC.  But I always wondered if reading on a device I held in my hand might be different than reading on my laptop. Thus, I started looking at Kindles, but didn't like they only had black and white screens.  So, I started looking at Kindle Fires, and when this one went on sale for $69 one week, decided it was time to get a Kindle.  I reasoned that if I still didn't like reading e-books on a Kindle, at least with the Fire, I would also have a computer and a device I could use for listening to music.Well, it turns out I love reading e-books on my Kindle Fire, almost as much as reading hard copies of books.  Actually, I haven't read any Kindle books yet, but am reading books sent from NetGalley, which took me a while to figure out were under DOCS, not BOOKS. I played around with the fonts, font sizes and brightness to get my reading screen exactly how I wanted it.  Unlike books or docs, though, you only have the choice of three font sizes when viewing the internet on this Kindle Fire, which is not a problem with me; but I'm sure it's a problem with some individuals since the web print is so small.  I haven't really used the Fire much for the internet.  I still prefer using my laptop for that.I also haven't tried the camera, since I always prefer digital cameras when taking pictures, than using cell phones or other such devices.  I've listened to some music, however, and think the sound is fine. While navigating the touch screen is never a problem when reading books, sometimes it is a problem for other things.  I don't know if it's me, since I'm not use to using touch screens, or if it's the Fire. Maybe I should get a touch screen stylus pen.  It's never a big, continuous problem, though.  Hence, all in all, I love my Kindle Fire, and am very happy I got one to read books. I'm also very happy I got the magenta one.  I had second thoughts about getting such a bright color, but I really like having such a colorful Kindle.  If you love colors, get a Fire.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JRS1573OQASV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCJ4HUW#wasThisHelpful","R2JRS1573OQASV","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a mail scale which is extremely accurate in pounds and ounces, but only goes to five pounds.  This Rubbermaid scale goes to 250 pounds so my days of worrying packages I mail will be over five pounds are over.  While this scale does not do ounces, it's accurate enough to know what pound weight to choose for a mailing rate. (I weighed items under five pounds on both this scale and the mail one to compare weight readings.)  It also has a most useful ""memory lock"" feature that you can use for big boxes that block the weight window.  Just put the big box on the scale, push the ""memory lock"", take the box off the scale, and its weight will be locked in for you to view.  The zero adjust knob is on the right side of the scale, and the briefcase design with the handle is great for easily moving the scale wherever you want it.  It's not a light scale at all, and it's not ""legal for trade"", but is going to be wonderful for mailing packages from home.

"***SPOILERS***Small Moments: A Child's Memories of the Civil Rights Movement is a work of creative nonfiction.  In the Author Q & A at the end of the story, author Mary Barrows provides the following description of that genre:  The term creative nonfiction means sticking to the truth as much as possible.  The stories are true, the characters are real people, and the places are real.  However, elements used in the craft of fiction are introduced to create cohesion and to introduce ideas.  Does this creative nonfiction story work?  In some ways, yes.  In other ways, no.There are three major problems.  One, the reader is left with a child protagonist, the author in the 1960s, who appears to be obsessing about the familys black maid and racism, when she probably was doing no such thing.  Two, the reader is left with a child protagonist who appears to have incredible insight about what is going on in her family and the country in the 1960s, when she definitely had no such thing.  Three, it was totally inappropriate to have a deathbed scene where the maids thoughts were being described.  There is no way the author knew what this woman, who was not a fictional character, was thinking when she was dying, and it was outrageous for Ms. Barrows to create such fictional thoughts for this book.Hence, one is left feeling that this story is a bit of an odd duck.  Yet, one is also left feeling deeply moved about the life of Amelia MacIntosh, the familys maid.  Amelia MacIntosh was born in 1902 in North Carolina, the last of 13 children.  She grew up motherless, never learned to read or write, and was married off at the age of 14 by her elderly father,  to a much older man who had a drinking problem.  Her only beloved child, a son, died at the age of 12, from lack of medical care for what was possibly congenital syphilis.  She herself died in 1964 from syphilis, gotten from her husband, who may have been part of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment.  When she died at the end of the story, I could not keep from crying, no matter how hard I tried.  Thinking of Amelia MacIntoshs life and death made the tears flow.*Oh Happy Day(Note: I received a free e-copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ORWU6R0RLD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940014069#wasThisHelpful","R21ORWU6R0RLD5","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second kocat wood cat litter I've used.  The first one had heavier, bigger pieces and tracked badly.  This ""soft step"" one has a much finer texture, and doesn't track . . . or maybe it's too hard to see it in the carpet.  It's also the lightest weight cat litter I've ever used.  The cats like it fine, but they're not picky, and it clumps pretty well, so the litter boxes are easy to clean. There's been no odor, but I'm scooping every day. While the litter is light, don't expect even the small box to be that light to lug around.  It's light in the litter boxes, but a full closed box of the litter still has weight.Update 10/24: Here it is over two weeks later, and I now will have to go buy more cat litter for the two boxes.

"If you cook this rice on the stove top or in the microwave, it will take approximately 30 minutes from start to finish.  I cooked it instead in my Hamilton Beach Digital Simplicity Rice Cooker and Steamer, 14-Cup (Cooked) Silver (37549), where it took 60 minutes on the ""whole grain"" mode.  It came out perfect, too.

Sticky or not, this Zatarain has a terrific white rice taste, and is suppose to be more nutritious than white rice, like  Minute Rice Long Grain White Rice - 14 oz, but it's really not. For example, Minute Rice has more protein, iron, niacin, folic acid and thiamin than the Zatarain rice.  The Zatarain rice, though, has less carbohydrates, more fiber and more calcium.  I didn't know Zatarain even made rice, and will have to check in the grocery store to see if I've simply been overlooking it.  I'll have to check and see if they have started stocking ZATARAIN'S Shrimp Creole Mix again, too.  I use to buy it all the time until no store had it any longer.  I thought they stopped making it.

"Although Killer Apes, Naked Apes, and Just Plain Nasty People: The Misuse and Abuse of Science in Political Discourse covers very serious topics, it's hard not to laugh throughout much of the book.  Author Richard J. Perry not only has written a book the general population can understand, he uses both facts and outstanding wit to go after those who are trying to pass off their personal prejudices as science.  He particularly likes to target scientists who forget to ""take the 'science' ID tag off the windshield"" when they drift from the field of science over to the field of social philosophy.  Give this book as a gift to anyone you know who thinks they are superior to others due to their ""race"" or their genes.

"Written with her youngest son, actress Charlotte Rae tells her life story from her Jewish childhood in Milwaukee to her current life as a 89-year-old.  There are lots of interesting stories about the plays, TV shows and movies she did, with lots of names of her fellow actors and how she felt about them.  While the cover of the book shows  The Facts Of Life: The Complete Series cast, only a small part of the book is about that show, because only a small part of her life was spent as Mrs. Garrett.  (Not that people don't still see her as Mrs. Garrett, and get all excited when they do see her! :)  Ms. Rae has been on television for over 60 years.Along with countless stories about her acting career, she also is not shy about talking about her personal life, including dealing with a drinking problem; dealing with a husband who made a startling confession one night; and dealing with her oldest son's autism, during a time period when the majority of people had never even heard the word ""autistic"".  The actress tells how she was so relieved and happy when a specialist finally diagnosed her son as autistic, because she thought he said her son was different because he was ""artistic"". The doctor had to write the word down on a piece of paper to help her understand what he was saying.  What he was saying broke her heart, too, but Ms. Rae is not one to succumb to self-pity or stupor.  Well, yes, she did drink a lot during many years of her life, but she overcame her drinking problem with the help of AA.  Charlotte Rae has always overcome adversity one way or another.  She's dedicated, she's happy, she's positive, she's thankful.(Note: I received a free e-copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R351PSVR1J7EZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593938527#wasThisHelpful","R351PSVR1J7EZ4","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Little Girl Blue: The Life of Karen Carpenter was a very interesting read, but not really ""superior"" to Ray Coleman's The Carpenters: The Untold Story : An Authorized Biography, as some reviewers have suggested. The major difference between this book and Ray Coleman's book is that Karen Carpenter is presented as a more tragic figure. Instead of being a strong-willed, opinionated woman, as she was in Mr. Coleman's book, she seems more emotionally like a confused perpetual little girl in Randy Schmidt's book. For example, the reader is told she didn't cancel her wedding to a cad, as she wanted, because her mother wouldn't let her. Mind you, she was in her thirties when she married. She then stays married to the cad, who is spending all her money, because she didn't believe in divorce, and desperately wanted children. Mind you, he had a vasectomy before they married, and told her so before they married. And what did she believe in--a marriage that was a total sham from the start?Randy Schmidt doesn't ask questions like that, or ponder any contradictions between Karen Carpenter's words and her actions. She is a victim in this book. She is the epitome of the silently suffering woman who dies from a broken heart. If that is how you see Karen Carpenter, you will love this book. If you want a book with more diverse viewpoints about her, Ray Coleman's book might be a better choice. I personally would have preferred to have read a memoir by 65-year-old Karen Carpenter, telling how she overcame her low self-esteem and her eating disorders--instead of a book entitled ""Little Girl Blue"".  She was a beautiful, enchanting woman, with one of the greatest pop singing voices ever . . . who simply sadly, slowly self-destructed.*Road Ode","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z2EYDRAR2A3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1569768188#wasThisHelpful","R1Z2EYDRAR2A3H","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Early on in Some Kind of Lonely Clown: The Music, Memory, and Melancholy Lives of Karen Carpenter (Hardback), author Joel Samberg describes how popular Karen Carpenter still is with fans, and how many things associated with her get sold at high prices.  One can imagine that matter was on Mr. Sambergs mind when he wrote this book, because this is strictly a fan book with nothing new in it.  While the title of the book suggests he is going to explore Karen Carpenters darker side, that really does not happen. If someone in the book was quoted as saying she seemed melancholic, others would be quickly quoted as saying she actually seemed like a happy person most of the time; although the author does strongly suggest she played a clown to cover up her unhappiness.  Hence, the title of the book.  Why  such an unflattering picture of her was chosen for the cover, however, is a mystery. Is the picture suppose to make her look lost and confused?The Carpenters fans this  biography is going to most appeal to are the ones who like to think of  Karen Carpenter as a perpetual hurt child.  For, once again, we have the theory that her mother was the main cause of her unhappiness and eating disorder.  Once again, we hear how she didnt find out her fianc had a vasectomy until right before the wedding, at which time she wanted to call it off, but her mother told her the show must go on!  Its curious that no writer has ever suggested Karen Carpenter only claimed she desperately wanted children, but in reality did not want to bear any; which could partly explain her eating disorder, which left her with the body of a boy; as well as the fact she did indeed marry a man who could not get her pregnant.  But thats the way the Karen Carpenter story tends to goeven though she was a woman in her thirties, her mean mommy was still responsible for most everything bad that happened to her.  Mr. Samberg even suggests Karen and Richard Carpenter were possibly in a constant state of anxiety due to the fact their prejudice mother might discover how many individuals they worked with were Jews!Talking about Richard Carpenter, theres no Richard bashing in this book.  Moreover, their father, like usual,  is seen like a really nice innocent bystander.  The only thing in this biography not usually found in other ones about the Carpenters is the author mentioned Karen Carpenters sexual orientation was questioned in forums about her.  Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, the author makes no similar suggestions about Richard Carpenter or the man his sister married.  This is not a book meant to create controversy.  Some Kind of Lonely Clown: The Music, Memory, and Melancholy Lives of Karen Carpenter (Hardback) is meant mostly to be a nostalgic look back at the Carpenters and the time period in which they lived.  Mr. Samberg also does a bit more speculation than others about what future projects  Karen Carpenter might have done if she had not died so young.  There is much wishful speculation.  Thats one of the things that makes this 164-page book strictly a collectors item, for those who collect anything and everything by and about the Carpenters.(Note: I received a free e-copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q02DR9VAGDS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593938691#wasThisHelpful","R2Q02DR9VAGDS8","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unless you have read Jubilee, Margaret Walker may not be a name you recognize.  That's one reason Carolyn J. Brown wrote this biography--she wanted to bring attention to a black woman writer who deserves more attention and recognition.  It's basically a short biography that is written in a way the general public will appreciate, and covers Margaret Walker's life from her birth in Alabama in 1915 to her death in Chicago in 1998.  Besides being a writer, Ms. Walker was also a college professor in Jackson, Mississippi for 30 years, and started one of the first college black studies program.  She also had a happy long-term marriage, four kids and lots of grandchildren.  (There is a lovely photo in the book of her surrounded by those grandchildren.)  With all that was going on in her teaching life and her home life, it took her decades to write Jubilee.  Poetry is where she started, though, and some of her poetry is included in this biography.  Poetry would always define Margaret Walker and the South would always define her poetry.""O Southland, sorrow home, melody beating in my bone andblood!

"This book by singer Jewel is part memoir, part self-help.  It also has endless introspection.  Jewel is one of those souls who basically raised herself.  Her father had a drinking problem and was abusive.  Her mother, for some reason, failed to see she was responsible for raising and financially supporting her own children.  She would eventually, however, become a big part of her daughters life after her daughter acquired lots of money her mother could squander as she wished.  Jewel played in bars with her father as a very young child, and went out on her own at the age of fifteen, at times being homeless.This is a slow, sad, draining book in many ways, partly because of the circumstances of both Jewels childhood and adulthood, and partly because of all the introspection.  In other ways, however, it shows how strong a child can be, and shows how success and stardom can be made possible with hard work and perseverance.  As an adult, Jewel obviously wants to help others with her writings, others who are having or had difficult childhoods, as well as others who want to be singers and songwriters.  That is certainly commendable.  She appears to be mostly happy, too, with her current life as a mother, singer and writer. Still, by the end of the book, it was difficult not to feel sad and overwhelmed by her life story.(Note: I received a free e-copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUNKATFJENWUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399174338#wasThisHelpful","RUNKATFJENWUR","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Never having used a robotic vacuum, I don't know how this Bissell compares to other robotic vacuums.  I just know it's a very interesting item that works fairly well.  I say fairly, because it never picked up everything off a carpet or floor, at least not in 30 minutes.  It can run for 99 minutes, however. It also navigates very well when I have it on the ""auto"" mode.  Additional modes are  ""spiral"" ""along the wall"", ""Z formation"" and ""random"". There are two suction choices--normal and turbo, and the docking station that comes with it can be programmed to send the vacuum to work the floors certain days of the week.  While the vacuum can go back automatically to the docking station, I haven't tried that yet.  Mostly I've been trying it out on various floors.  It did well on green carpet, a white ceramic floor, a black ceramic floor with white grout, and a totally black thick carpet.  But it did not work at all on a black floor covering, that is sort of like a very, very thin rug.  The E5 error code comes up on dark surfaces the vacuum cannot do.The dust bin, brushroll, filter, and edge cleaning brushes are easy to clean.  Moreover, replacement filters and edge cleaning brushes will soon be available at the Bissell website for $14.  You can also buy a remote control at that web site, when it becomes available, if you did not get one with your model.  One did not come with this model.  With the remote control, you can control what direction the vacuum goes, as well as choose modes, suction powers and times. A remote would make things a bit easier, but it's not really a necessity, especially since most people will not be standing or sitting there watching the vacuum work . . . at least not after they've used it for a while. :)  This model did  include an ""invisible wall"" that requires four AA batteries that are not included, which will keep the vacuum from going past a certain point, such as into another room.  (Unfortunately, there currently appear to be no additional ""invisible walls"" that  can be purchased at the Bissell website.)  All in all, I think it's a good vacuum for those who want a vacuum running when they are not around; or for someone who wants to set it up for an elderly, ill or incapacitated person, who can't vacuum; or for someone who wants less housework to do.  Personally, I still think it's easier to just grab a vacuum and do the job yourself.  More stuff gets picked up in a shorter amount of time.

I installed Windows 10 this week on my laptop, got this book, just finished it, and now know all sorts of things about Windows 10 I did not know; things that probably would have taken some time to figure out without the book.  Some of the information in the book is very basic, so it would work for someone who had limited computer exposure.  Some of the information is more complex, but the photos and detailed directions make it all seem simple.  Windows 10 is pretty exciting, in my opinion, and Paul McFedries' manual did not dampen my excitement, but instead left me feeling more knowledgeable about Windows 10 than the average user.  That's a sign of good teaching.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HN6IVZ9PTC2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119057027#wasThisHelpful","R2HN6IVZ9PTC2A","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know I probably should wait a while before reviewing Windows 10, but I'm so happy with it that I decided I'll just update in the future if it goes bad on me.  Right now, though, it is the faster and most fabulous Windows OS I have ever used, except it doesn't have Word for free like the Vista on my Dell laptop.Okay, I'm reviewing the free download from Microsoft, which anyone can get for any device with home versions of Windows 7 or 8 on it.  Months ago, I reserved Windows 10 for my Toshiba Satellite laptop with Windows 7.  After reserving it, my Toshiba started having problems, especially on start up.  It could take me sometimes 10 minutes to get online! Firefox froze constantly, Chrome was only slightly better, and IE would hardly ever work at all.  I suspected the problems were due to Windows 10 either being downloaded or tested out on my laptop in the background. At one point, I even stopped the automatic Windows Updates so I could see what was being installed.  Unfortunately, I forgot I stopped automatically updating and when I went to Windows Updates this week, saw that I had countless critical updates.  I also had only one choice to choose--Install Windows 10.  They didn't even send me a notice it was my time to do so, after I had been waiting for the notice for months.Well, I hit the install button, left my laptop plugged in and went about my day.  When I came home and checked the download in the late afternoon, it said it had failed.  The error code suggested the laptop lost connection to the internet.  Thus, I started again and the download amount immediately went to 49% . . . but then it went down to 0%.  I then decided to try to do individual installation of all the critical updates for Windows 7, pushed cancel, and discovered I no longer could view the individual updates.  My only choice was to choose installing Windows 10 again, which I did, and my download amount immediately became 90%.  It then quickly went to 100%, the installation started and finished in no time, and I, at long last, had Windows 10.It started off with some settings questions that seemed like nothing but spying to me, so I chose ""off"" for all of them.  That didn't seem to slow down Windows 10 at all or mess it up or whatever.  Now, when I go online, I'm online in usually 60 seconds or so.  Firefox, Chrome and Windows Edge, which replaced IE, are all working well.  I can go from one browser to another with no problems.  Also, my Epson Expression Home XP-420 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner & Copier, Adobe Digital Reader 4.5, WordPerfect Office X7 Home and Student and SecureAnywhere Internet Security Complete 2015 5 Device 1 Year PC are all working well.  Moreover, iTunes is starting up quickly, and it's going to  be interesting if I can finally get that working right, which I've never been able to do with the Toshiba.To learn everything about Windows 10, I'm using Teach Yourself VISUALLY Windows 10 (Teach Yourself VISUALLY (Tech)).  I just started the book tonight and it is terrific about explaining everything in words and pictures.  For the first time ever, I now understand what apps are and what they do.  In the past, I just ignored reading or learning about them.  The book also shows you to how to connect your Microsoft account to your Windows user account, in order to access all sorts of Windows features, some ""previously inaccessible"".  I still worry about spying and security with Windows 10, but right now I'm plowing ahead and hoping Windows 10 does prove itself to be the best Microsoft OS ever created. We'll see . . . .Update 10/1:  Had my first major problem--after installing Windows 10, my DVD drive was not recognized at all.  I put a disk in tonight and absolutely nothing happened. Turns out, it's an easy fix for Toshiba owners, though.  Go to your control panel . . . and you have to type that in the search box to get there . . . which is one thing I don't like about Windows 10 . . . choose programs and uninstall the following two programs: TOSHIBA Recovery Media Creator and TOSHIBA Disc Creator. Then, restart your PC and your DVD drive will be recognized.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSVNCFUF4ND3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01019BM7O#wasThisHelpful","RSVNCFUF4ND3U","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used Woods surge protectors for years, and was surprised how inexpensive this one happened to be.  When I saw it, however, I realized why it was so cheap--it's a very basic, very cheap plastic surge protector for items like clock radios and such. It's an extremely tight fit putting plugs into it, too.  If you have three normal type plugs, all outlets can be used.  If you have something like a cell phone plug, though, only two outlets can be used.  (The outlets do have dust covers, so the one you can't use can be closed.)  Putting this surge protector in the top wall outlet will also allow you to use the bottom wall outlet.  It's UL listed and made in China, and I would only use it for inexpensive electronic items.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RODQ5DMLRJQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMJ8W#wasThisHelpful","R1RODQ5DMLRJQ2","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a story about a young woman in the 1950s with one foot in her hometown and one foot in New York City.  She immediately feels uncomfortable in more ways than one when she returns home to her small town in the South.  She doesn't fit in.  She can't be like all the other women in town.  She can't bring herself to accept a marriage proposal from a dear old friend, because she knows she can't stay, and cannot be the type of wife he wants or needs. She also has to come to grips with the fact her friend and the father she idolizes are segregationists.  Realizing her father is like that is the hardest thing she has ever had to deal with in her life.  For he's always been like a god to her.  This is a story about growing up and realizing only children should idolize others.  Maybe if some readers realized that includes idolizing authors and fictional characters, they would appreciate this novel for what it is--not only an insightful story about becoming emotionally mature, but also a detailed description of how complicated the integration issue was in the South during the 1950s.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZGMVH7XBR37L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062409859#wasThisHelpful","R1ZGMVH7XBR37L","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review will hopefully help anyone trying to decide between getting this Panasonic Plush Pro or the Panasonic MC-CL943 JETFORCE Mult-Surface Bagless Canister Vacuum Cleaner.  These two vacuums are actually exactly alike, except for their nozzles, pet/air turbine attachments and color.  Everything else is the same and you could interchange all attachments, if you had both canisters.  After using both vacuums, I think Panasonic should consider either making a model that includes both the power nozzle of this Plush Pro and the multi-surface nozzle of the other canister; or sell the nozzles as parts for anyone who wants both nozzles.The Plush Pro nozzle excels in carpet cleaning, including plusher carpet.  Its heavy and self-propelled and is as good as an upright in vacuuming.  Its also does a great job with heavy rugs and carpeted stairs.  Only, the big power nozzle makes it feel very heavy when doing stairs.  But thats where the included air turbine attachment comes in-it, too,  does stairs really, really well and can be attached directly to the handle.  Both the nozzle and the air turbine attachment easily suck up pet hair. The Multi Surface Panasonics nozzle also does a great job getting up pet hair, but I find its pet attachment useless on carpet.  Moreover, if youre vacuuming long silky type pet hair, you have to constantly pull or cut off hair from the agitator brushes and the two small wheels on the bottom of the nozzle.  This is time consuming.  The much larger, more powerful Plush Pro nozzle can handle more pet hair.  (Ill add a picture of the two nozzles side by side after the review posts.)Both models do floors well, too, but I think the Multi-Surface excels in all floors.  The Plush Pro sounds like a tank on ceramic tile floors, while the Multi-Surface glides, with its lightweight and super soft bristles.  The Pro Plush bristles are harder, typical vacuum bristles.  In addition the Multi-Surface has an innovative edge cleaning design, complete with super soft bristles in front of the nozzle that dusts the baseboards!  The Pro Plush also does baseboards well, but nothing can compete with the Multi-Surfaces edge cleaning.  As a smaller nozzle, too, it fits easier under cabinets and such, but the Pro Plush also fits under cabinets. In addition, the Pro Plush nozzle is more like the nozzles on the traditional canisters with carpet height adjustments.The canisters are heavy on these Panasonics, so they dont easily perch on stairs and cant be held while vacuuming.  Thus, even though the telescopic wand extends from two feet to three feet, a long, straight stairway could be a challenge to vacuum.  There are three filters--a cleanable pre-filter in the dust cup, a washable sponge one in the dust cup, and a HEPA exhaust one in a drawer in the canister.  To me, the HEPA one smells like an air purifier with an ionizer on.  I really like that, but some may not.  Both the HEPA and the sponge filters are replaceable.  The HEPA filter is actually suppose to be replaced when it becomes evenly dirty.  Currently, on the Panasonic website, the HEPA filter costs $8, the sponge filter costs $6 and the belt is $5.  The dust cup is easy to empty and clean, and complete directions are included in the users manual, which is a most excellent and thorough one. Safety features include a motor protector and a thermal protector.So, which model to get?  As stated earlier in the review, its too bad you cant get a model with both nozzles, or buy a nozzle by itself.  Then youd have the perfect canister vacuum. You can, however, buy an air turbine attachment for $25 at the Panasonic website, and I would recommend that for anyone getting the Multi-Surface model, who also wanted a good air powered small attachment.  If you have a lot of floors and not too thick carpet, I would indeed suggest getting the Multi-Surface model, unless you think you would be constantly cleaning the agitator brushes due to long hair or threads and such.  If you need a canister for lots of carpet, though,  including plush carpet, the Plush Pro model might be your best bet.  Both models are excellent canister vacuums, because Panasonic tends to excel in canister vacuums.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KXQQ3VU18T0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHUEZIQ#wasThisHelpful","R2KXQQ3VU18T0H","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This nice looking, roomy shower caddy is replacing a much smaller one where the paint was flaking off.

"When I first started reading My Southern Journey: True Stories from the Heart of the South, I had problems sticking with it.  That was due to the fact I like to read books straight through, and that's not the best way to read this book.  It's best to read all these short glimpses of the South and of a Southerner's longing for the South in short reading sessions.

"It has been a long time since I have bought a bath scale, so this one was a bit of a surprise.  It looks like a glass floor tile, and goes well with the tiles in my dressing room.  It's simple to use, too.  You just step on it and when the numbers stop flashing, there's your weight.  If you're badly nearsighted, you can even step off of the scale, pick it up and read your weight, before the numbers disappear. If you move the scale, though, when you put it back down on a floor, you need to step on it and step off of it, and then step back on it to get your correct weight.It has to be placed on a hard, flat floor, too, since it will misread on carpet.  My only disappointment in the scale is you cannot use it to weigh boxes.  They don't register at all.  Also, I was picturing cleaning it with Windex, but you can use no chemicals to clean it, only a damp cloth and a mild soap.  The scale comes with the two needed batteries--Energizer CR2032 3 Volt Lithium Coin Battery 10 Pack (2 packs of 5), has a low battery indicator, is made in China, and has a limited 5-year warranty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B7CN3ZU5CPJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014IUI59A#wasThisHelpful","R2B7CN3ZU5CPJI","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is definitely one of the oddest stories I have ever read.  On one hand, parts of it are relatively normal and interesting, such as the idea that West Virginians Homer and Elsie are taking their pet alligator Albert back to where he came from--Florida.  (Yes, that's the normal part.) On the other hand, parts are totally ridiculous and irritating beyond words, such as many of the adventures they all have on their long road trip.  The way everyone talks is often odder than odd, too.  Maybe this story is a parody or parable that I simply don't recognize or understand.  Maybe I simply don't get the humor.  The hurricane part was obviously not meant to be humorous, however, and I'm not sure what that was even doing in a book filled with silly adventures.  Finally, while Homer is a decent enough guy, Elsie is highly unlikable, and Albert . . . well, if it wasn't for Albert and his yeah-yeah-yeah happy sound, I would have quit reading the story shortly after they picked up John Steinbeck, which was way-way-way in the beginning of the book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3909DR00ZFB7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062325892#wasThisHelpful","R3909DR00ZFB7W","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cucumber seed pod was part of a set I got this summer.  Like usual, I planted late--early July--and it was mostly in the 90s all summer.  I also planted the pod in old soil in a pot.

"Panasonic canister vacuums have never disappointed me.  They have always been very well made and have vacuumed very well.  This one is the first modern designed Panasonic I have ever used.  My others have been the traditional designed ones with a lid that opened and stored all the attachments.  With this one, the crevice tool and dusting brush attach to the wand with a plastic holder.  (The ""pet glide"" attaches nowhere.)  When I saw a picture of this vacuum, I was expecting it to be much lighter than the traditional canisters.  I was wrong.  It's just as heavy, and cannot be easily perched on a stair, just like the traditional ones cannot.Moreover, when I saw the small multi-surface nozzle, which is approximately 10 inches, I suspected the vacuum might not be as multi-surfaced as promised.  I've used vacuums with small nozzles that only did well on floors, not carpets.  But Panasonic told no lies!  I was surprised to no end how well this canister vacuumed both floors and carpets, including thicker carpet.  Even more delightfully surprising was how well it worked against baseboards and in stairway crevices.  I've never seen a vacuum work so well.  This ""edge grabber"" nozzle is especially designed to be special when it comes to baseboard cleaning.  There's even a super soft bristle attachment in front of the nozzle that dusts the baseboards as you vacuum.  The small-sized nozzle superbly fits under cabinets and such, too, and you can vacuum both vertically and horizontally.I've used the vacuum on thick carpet, thin carpet floor covering, ceramic tile and normal tile, and it has proved to be truly a multi-surface vacuum.  On carpeted stairs, it does a most wonderful job; but my stairs have a center platform, where I can safely place the canister to do the top part of the stairway.  Doing a long stairway that goes straight up would not be so easy, even though the wand extends from approximately two feet to approximately three feet.  As stated earlier, it's not the type of light canister that can be easily perched on stairs or held while vacuuming.  Panasonic makes sturdy vacuums.The multi-nozzle also does an excellent job of getting pet hair off carpeted stairs, while the ""pet glide"" attachment does not.  But the ""pet glide"" is suppose to be more of an upholstery attachment anyway.  It's not a powered one, however, and has just plastic rollers. Thus, if you're specifically looking for an exceptional pet hair attachment, this vacuum is definitely not for you; unless you want to get an exceptional air turbine attachment at the Panasonic website for $25.  ( Update 9/26: After writing this review, I tried this vacuum out at a home with a large,  long-haired dog with silky type hair. Not using the pet attachment, but just the multi-nozzle, all the hair was easily picked up.  Yet, you will have to constantly cut off hair and clean the agitator brush, as well as two small wheels behind it, to keep the vacuum working well. )Filter wise, there are three--a cleanable pre-filter in the dust cup, a washable sponge one in the dust cup, and a HEPA exhaust one in a drawer in the canister.  I like the smell of the HEPA one-- it smells like an air purifier with the ionizer turned on.  Both the sponge one and the HEPA one are replaceable.  In fact, the HEPA one is suppose to be replaced whenever it becomes evenly dirty.  Currently, on the Panasonic website, the sponge one costs $6 and the HEPA one costs $8.00. (There is also a belt in the nozzle, but I see no belt part number.)  The agitator in the nozzle is suppose to be cleaned once a month, and full directions are provided in the included excellent user's manual.  The dust cup cleaning/emptying directions are of course also included, and dust cup removal and care is easy.Let's see, what else . . . the cord is retractable; the control buttons are on the handle, as is an air suction control; the release buttons work pretty easily; there are directions for removing clogs in the user's manual; there is both a motor protector and a thermal protector; the canister is a pretty blue and very cool looking.  All in all, I think it is a terrific canister for anyone with multi-floor surfaces, or anyone who just wants a canister for one type of floor surface.  (It's suppose to be most gentle with wood floors.)  Once again, it's exceptional for baseboard/stair crevice cleaning.  While the canister is heavy, the handle and wand and nozzle are not particularly so, which makes it good for those who can't vacuum well with heavier handles and attachments.  This Panasonic multi-surface canister vacuum also appears to be built to last, and hopefully it will last, because the warranty (labor/parts/motor) is only one year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMIO9HXSEEQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFUVNKS#wasThisHelpful","RMIO9HXSEEQC","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those who have read Wilkie Collins' work will probably get a lot more out of this book than those who have not.  Unfortunately, I am one of those who had never even heard of Mr. Collins before reading this biography, and ended up never feeling more than mildly interested while reading it.  Wilkie Collins was a very successful writer during Charles Dickens' time, and was a good friend of Mr. Dickens.  The women in his stories were often strong women, very different from how women were usually portrayed in fiction during that time period.  Wilkie Collins adored his mother and never married, but had two mistresses, at the same time at one point.  He was also ill with one thing or another and addicted to drugs, provided by his doctor, throughout most of his adult life. He still traveled a lot, however, and wrote a lot . . . and this is the type of brief review one not familiar with his writings will likely write, after reading Wilkie Collins: A Brief Life. :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BM15Q7A0YPZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537395#wasThisHelpful","R1BM15Q7A0YPZ8","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since The Light Between Us: Stories from Heaven. Lessons for the Living. was being described as one for fans of Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife, I almost did not read it.  For I'm no fan of Dr. Alexander's book, and see it as just another New Age money-making racket book.  Since Laura Lynn Jackson is a high school teacher, though, I wanted to see how she was mixing being a teacher with being a medium, and was she going to keep her teaching job after this book was published?All in all, Ms. Jackson's book turned out to be an interesting, well-written book.  It was also hard to imagine she was making up everything in it; and if she was doing that, how she would not be quickly exposed after the book was released.  In addition, much of her work has involved doing readings for parents who have lost children, and it's really hard to imagine this woman, mother and teacher taking advantage of grieving parents!  Furthermore, she did not come across as being narcissistic and self-deluded, like Eben Alexander came across in his book.Yet, to not imagine those things means she is a genuine medium who can communicate with the dead.  Now, I've read a lot of books on mediums over the years; including The Witch of Lime Street: Sance, Seduction, and Houdini in the Spirit World, which is being published next month; and I'm not convinced there are or were any genuine mediums.  However, I'm also not convinced there are or were no genuine mediums.  While Ms. Jackson's book made me think about the matter some more, until the day I personally encounter a medium who turns me into a believer, thinking and reading about the matter is all I'll ever do.  For me, that's enough when it comes to the interesting topic of mediumship.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37LMR00EDZZQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812998383#wasThisHelpful","R37LMR00EDZZQL","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A Place We Knew Well: A Novel worked in some ways, but not in others.  Author Susan Carol  McCarthy did an excellent job describing in both facts and feelings what was going on in Florida during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Her strongest character was Wes Avery, a father and husband, who dropped bombs on civilians in Japan during WWII, as well as was in a plane that flew over Hiroshima after the atomic bomb had been dropped.  It's less than 10 years later, and he knows good and well what will happen to his family, friends, neighbors and customers if they are bombed by the Russians. The crisis is also making him think more deeply about his family life, and what seems to be happening to his wife Sarah.Sarah, a most dedicated wife and mother, is becoming overwhelmed by a possible approaching hurricane and then the missile crisis.  She starts spending more and more time thinking about the past, including a singing career she could have had, and less and less time thinking about everyday reality.  At some point, she breaks, partly due to the stress and partly due to all the drugs she gets from her doctor.  This is the 1960s, when doctors handed out tranquilizers and all sorts of other pills like candy to ""distressed"" housewives.  Unfortunately, for both Sarah and the story, things stop working out at that point.  Sarah's story seems too incomplete and gives the book a terrible unfinished feeling.Add to that a dark family secret, as well as the arrival of a long lost relative, and the book seems like a misguided missile shooting way off in the wrong direction.  What did that family secret and lost relative contribute to the story?  In my opinion, nothing.  If they were both necessary, they should have stayed in the story's background.  But why did they exist in the first place? Was it suppose to be a comment on the stricter moral beliefs of the time? Talking about comments, what was the purpose of the nasty comment Sarah's daughter hears her mother say when she was out of her mind?  Was it suppose to make the story more dramatic or something?  Must so many contemporary fiction and nonfiction books have family secrets?  In nonfiction, so many of those secrets really aren't that interesting to those outside of the family.  In fiction, they are the same type of secrets being told over and over again.Yes, this story covered only 13 days in October of 1962.  But even with the first chapter, which takes place in 2009; as well as the unique ""epilogue"" at the end, which takes place in 2013; the story seemed unfinished and parts were detrimental to the novel as a whole.  Yet, I find I can't give this book any less than four stars.  One, the author did such a good job capturing the time period and the fears, as well as the weather and how it affected the feelings of those in Florida.  Two, she brought up things like Operation Pedro Pan; which most readers probably don't know about and will find interesting enough to do some further research.  Three, I love stories from the 1960s.  Moreover, although I was a few states farther north, and too young to remember the Cuban Missile Crisis at all, I still remember a military kid, four years later, bragging in class that we would be one of the first places hit, if the Russians ever bombed the United States. I believe he said that right after he played The Ballad Of The Green Berets for show-and-tell.  Ah, the 1960s . . . you had to be there . . . .","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYQK0WUPVR3ED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417654X#wasThisHelpful","RYQK0WUPVR3ED","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Author Alex Sheshunoff chucks his job, New York and his Spanish girlfriend for life on an island. Any island. Well, he does have a specific group of islands in mind in the Pacific. He also is fortunately not a playboy type looking for fun in the sun. No, he had the idea of bringing 100 books with him to read. His mother, a no-nonsense Canadian who lives in Texas, gives him her honest opinion of his plan, but that does not stop our Mr. Sheshunoff! (And he still stays in contact with his mother the whole time he is gone!)Thus, off we go to Yap Island in Micronesia . . . or maybe Yap is the name of a group of islands . . .I never got that straight. I just know he ended up on one and then another . . . and another? . . . until he sort of settled down on the island of Palau. Before getting to Palau, the story was extremely funny and very educational. Probably most Americans know little about all the specifics of those little islands in the Pacific, and certainly don't know what day-to-day life is like on those islands. When it comes right down to it, not much happens on those islands, but that's one of the things that made the story so humorous at times. Other times, it was like being in an old Twilight Zone episode . . . only one that wasn't scary and had no moral . . .but was simply strange.Then, our Mr. Sheshunoff got to Palau, and unfortunately the story started dragging and was not as amusing. I don't know, I think it was because he was hanging around other Americans, such as his future wife, and Americans just weren't as funny as the natives! (Or maybe he and his editors do not know how to edit well.) Also, while he, thank God, wasn't one of those writers who thinks everyone wants to read all the intimate details of his love life, he still provided too many details of his and his wife's courtship. So, so many of those details were totally mundane, too. While I'm sure this book will provide an excellent family record for his children and grandchildren one day, the whole matter of how Alex and Sarah got together and stayed together is just not that interesting to a reader outside of the family. (Interestingly, though, she appeared to be a bit like his mother!)Finally, we get to building a house on an island in the Pacific. The story then dragged even more and became even less funny. First off, they played juvenile jokes on those who were coming to the island to help them build the house. (Really, we thought our Mr. Sheshunoff was above such adolescent pranks!) Second off, he goes into great detail about building the house. Now, if you are thinking of building a house on a Pacific island, this is the book for you! However, if you're not, and you don't like to do things like hang around Home Depot, you might skim the house building part until you get to the baby monkey part. The baby monkey is SO cute and so much more interesting than that stupid house they were building! Go to our Mr. Sheshunoff's website to see pictures of the baby monkey. (Oh, you can also see pictures of the stupid house if you want .) In addition, you will learn from the website where our Mr. Sheshunoff is today and what he's doing. I'm happy to report he is obviously still writing very funny stuff . . .and hopefully learning how to do a better job of editing his next book . . . like maybe cutting out 100 pages! :)(Note: I received a free e-copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X4KX71YZ04BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02D90#wasThisHelpful","R2X4KX71YZ04BL","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Uncertainties frighten and anger Jackson.  He prides himself on his scientist-like thinking, and that's what he wants to be when he grows up--a scientist.  But, like most kids in a family with some serious problems, he has limited time to think about his future.  His dad was once a successful construction worker who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and could only take part-time jobs after that time.  His mother was once a middle-school music teacher, until her job was eliminated, and she then started working up to three part-time jobs at a time.  Unfortunately, all that part-time work never seemed to add up to full-time wages, and, once again, Jackson's family was looking at the possibility of having to live in their van.Living in the van didn't seem that bad to Jackson the summer before he entered second grade, but he could not fathom doing so again the summer before he was starting fifth grade.  That's when Crenshaw returned.  Crenshaw was there the first time the family became homeless, and he was back the second time it looked like homelessness was approaching.  Crenshaw was Jackson's imaginary friend, and he was one big cat.  Like Jackson, he also wasn't particularly sentimental and liked to stick to facts.  Unlike Jackson, who feared he was beginning to lose it, Crenshaw had no problem with the existence of an imaginary friend, even for a boy going into fifth grade.So this story goes . . . and it is an excellent example of a writer dealing with a major social issue without being too heavy-handed.  For some, the story will seem magical.  For others, it won't seem magical enough.  For example, at times, Crenshaw seems more like a therapist explaining why imaginary friends exist, instead of seeming like an imaginary friend created by a young boy. Yet,  maybe that's the type of imaginary friend a budding scientist would create in his mind.  Jackson also has a friend named Marisol who wants to be a scientist when she grows up.  The author is nicely demonstrating with her character the fact that having just one real friend can make all the difference in the world, to a child heading towards an uncertain time in his or her life. (Obviously,  having an unreal friend can help, too. )Uncertainty.  Legions of homeless children or those being threatened by homelessness are dealing with uncertainties every minute of their lives.  Crenshaw may be a book that helps those children.  It also may be a book that will help children who never have to face the possibility of homelessness understand better those who do.  Crenshaw is a cat.  A big cat.  There is no animal that has better survival skills or instincts.  This is not a particularly sentimental story.  It's also not a story that will scare children . . . at least not too much.  The ending is one of hope, but not hope of an unrealistic type.  Yet, the story shows magic can exist . . . even in the mind of a young scientist . . . and can help make a difficult time less difficult.  So can love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V92G5D891Z17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250043239#wasThisHelpful","R3V92G5D891Z17","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this Bluetooth clock radio came with a short user manual, Philips suggests going to their website to download the full user manual.  I would strongly suggest the same thing.  Your life will be easier and less confusing if you do so.  Only, finding the manual turned out to be confusing itself.  When I went to Philips support, this model was not listed.  Thus, I had to list the model in a search engine and then find it on a Philips support page that way.  (I'll list the support page in a comment after my review, so the review won't be rejected for having a web page listing.)  The full manual helps you set the clock much easier.  I used the short manual the first time I set it, and it took me a while to get it right.  It will take you a minute with the full manual instructions.  The clock can be set 12 or 24 hours, and will lose its time if there is any power outage.  Thus, you can install 2 AA batteries if you want, to keep that from happening, but you cannot use batteries to run the clock. (Note: Only the PM symbol is present on this clock.  There is no visible AM symbol.)The clock numbers have three levels of brightness that can be adjusted using the SNOOZE/BRIGHTNESS button.  I didn't find any of the levels to be too bright at night, and I am a person who likes total darkness while sleeping.  I did choose the lowest light level, however. The two alarms are also easy to set using the directions from the full manual, and you can wake up to a buzzing alarm or the radio station you last listened to.  (Remember to turn up the volume of the radio to one that will wake you, if waking up to radio.)  I only use the buzz alarm . . . which is actually more like a beep . . . and was surprised the first time I heard it, because it was so low.  I was already awake when the alarm went off, and thought there was no way that quiet buzz would wake me up.  Ah, but then the buzzing got louder and louder until I turned it off! I really like that, because that will allow you to wake up to the lowest buzzing sound that will wake you up.  (For you snoozers, it's nine minutes more sleep after hitting the snooze button.)Scanning and storing FM stations . . . and yes, it's only FM . . .is also easier if you read the full manual first.  I did not read it, simply hit the SCAN/PROG button, and it automatically scanned in 20 local stations from lowest call number to highest.  That was great, except there are more than 20 FM stations in my area, so some were left out after that scan.  But you can of course go back and manually program by storing another station in the place of a stored station.  Sound wise, I think this little 4"" x 4"" box has a terrific sound! I was surprised, too, how high the volume got.  This is very unlike the radio alarms of the old days, which is the last time I had a radio alarm clock.Okay, this is the Philips model that will play music from any Bluetooth device you have that is ""compatible with this product"".  My iPod is a classic one, so I have no Bluetooth music device.  This clock radio can memorize up to four paired devices, and the operational range will be approximately 30 feet between this clock radio and your Bluetooth device.  I do have a Bluetooth capable flip phone, and had no problem connecting my T-Mobile 768 Prepaid Phone (T-Mobile) to this Philips.  I have no desire to keep my phone connected to any Bluetooth speaker, however, so I just tested out this phone feature once.  The person who called me sounded perfectly normal while using this clock radio, but she thought there was a slight echo when I was speaking in front of the radio, but not when I was speaking towards the top of the radio. You can answer a call, end a call and reject a call with this model.  Moreover, any music playing will pause when there is an incoming call.Other things you can do . . . you can easily set a timer to turn the radio off after 15-120 minutes.  In addition, you can charge your cell phone or MP3 player or what have you with a USB cable, which is not included.  I tried charging my phone, using the cable that came with my HP Roar Mini Bluetooth Speaker, White, and it was charging fine.  (That was just to test it out, though, and I don't know how long it would take to completely charge the phone with this clock radio.)  It's certainly a nice feature to have, however, especially if you're traveling with this clock.At 4""x4"" and 13.1 ounces, this clock radio can certainly easily be packed up and taken places.  Yes, you can use your cell phone as an alarm clock, and that's what I've done at home for the last few years.  Only I grew to hate using a cell phone.  Even at its loudest, sometimes it did not wake me up out of a deep sleep, and I hated the alarm sound choices. ( Music doesn't always tend to wake me up, either. I just incorporate the song playing into my dreams. :) Hence, I'm very happy to have a dedicated alarm clock once again, and this Philips is certainly a nice sounding, stylish one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ULE7QNNY8MJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012J1B8CG#wasThisHelpful","R3ULE7QNNY8MJY","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The pot I received does not look like the current item picture.  (It looks like the pot currently being advertised on this page by Lenox called the ""Rick Bayless 16-qt Red Stockpot"".) It does not have a glass lid, but a lid that is made of the same material as the pot.  The handle on the lid is the same as the handles on the pot, too, and all handles get very hot when cooking!  Thus, you need a pot holder to open the lid and stir your food. My pot also looks very much like a Rachael Ray 12-qt speckled red stockpot my mother bought at Walmart. Her pot was only half the price of this one, and did not come with a steamer rack, which is apparently for cooking tamales.I was hoping the included recipe booklet would encourage me to cook some new Mexican food, but I'm afraid Rick Bayless' recipes are all out of my hemisphere.  Thus, so far I've only used the pot to cook chili, and will probably use it in the future for other soups and stews, too, as well as for cooking chicken.  In addition, I was hoping it could be a large steaming pot for vegetables, since all my steaming pots are small, but a steamer rack is not a steamer basket, so that's out.  My chili did not stick to the pot, which is good since nothing abrasive can be used to clean the stockpot; and it cannot be put in the dishwasher, contrary to what the item description currently says on this Amazon page. (Bad news for me since I'm very big on putting almost everything in the dishwasher!) It's a handful to wash, too, since the pot is 9 and half inches tall.All in all, though, it is a beautiful pot with enough room to cook a whole lot of food at once.  (Thus, make sure you need a stockpot this big, instead of a 12-qt one.  The deeper the pot, the more strenuous the stirring.  And the less food you have in a tall pot, the more heat hits your arm while you are stirring.)  It also looks like it is made to last forever and ever, which is good in this day and age of cheaply made items. This Rick Bayless pot was made in Thailand for Gorham, a division of the Lenox Corporation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XS5OI9OSW6PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAAR8LQ#wasThisHelpful","R1XS5OI9OSW6PW","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I listened to music for years and years using only a $10 pair of Panasonic headphones that were discontinued a few years ago--Panasonic RP-HG10 Neck Band Headphones with XBS Extra Bass System (Discontinued by Manufacturer).  Since that time, I have searched and searched for decent sounding Panasonic small headphones.  Most newer models I tried sounded nothing like my old cheapo model.  These travel ones are better sounding than other pairs I've tried, but make sure you adjust your equalizer on your iPod or whatever to a sound that you like.  ""Off"" or ""flat"" will not work with these Panasonics. The music sounds terrible.  I strangely discovered songs sounded best on the ""piano"" EQ setting.  Usually, I use the ""dance"" or ""spoken word"" settings with small headphones, but neither of those sounded quite right with this pair.Listening to talking on online videos sounded like being in a tunnel to me, as did talking on the phone.  The headphones worked well with my T-Mobile 768 Prepaid Phone (T-Mobile), though, in regards to using the microphone in the cord to answer calls.  Comfort wise, I intensely dislike these Panasonics.  They are too sticky in hot weather and the band is too hard a type of plastic.  The band does have a wide size range, however.  It goes from approximately 12 to 15 inches.  But I'm just going back to my Philips SHL5100YL/28 Strada Headband Headphones, Yellow to listen to my music.  I was one of Panasonic's biggest headphone fans for years, but no more.

"When you first look at this Dell keyboard and mouse set, it appears to be nothing special, and you wonder why the combo is currently selling for $50.  Like so many other sets, both the keyboard and mouse have on/off switches, and the batteries for both are included.  (The batteries in this set, though, are suppose to last for 12 months. They are standard Duracell.)  The keyboard weighs 15.8 ounces and is 17 inches long.  The mouse weighs 3.1 ounces and is four inches long.  Both seem to be made of very thin plastic. The keyboard is comfortable enough to type on, but I don't think it's elevated enough in the back for comfortable extended use on a flat surface.  The mouse wheel is loose and smooth.  The combo uses a Logitech USB plug, and the drivers quickly installed on my laptop, after putting the plug in a USB port on my Toshiba.That USB plug can also be used in other devices, such as a TV, and that is why this keyboard and mouse set is different from many others.  As the description states, it is a multimedia set; which means it has dedicated media keys other keyboards do not; such as play, pause, fast forward and reverse, as well as three volume ones.  It's like the Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad, Black or the Microsoft Wireless All-In-One Media Keyboard (N9Z-00001), only this Dell has a mouse and not a touchpad.  Also, the Logitech 400, which I own, does not have as many dedicated media keys as this Dell, but the Microsoft one does. (Another keyboard you may want to look at that does have all the media  keys is the Logitech Wireless Desktop MK320 Combo).I tried the Dell plug in my LG Google TV,  which turned out to be the same exact plug as my Logitech keyboard plug, and the up and down keys, volume keys, play and pause keys all worked.  But the fast forward/reverse ones did not work on a show in my Amazon library.  The media keys also worked with  my Toshiba DVD Player, although I did not try the fast forward and reverse ones. When it comes right down to it, though, I prefer not to use media keys on a keyboard, but my TV remote control, or the media controls on a laptop or screen.  Also, when using a keyboard with my Google TV, I want a touchpad, not a mouse, which is why I got the Logitech 400. Thus, I'm presently not that impressed with this Dell keyboard and mouse combo.

"From start to finish, Nonsense: The Power of Not Knowing is a highly readable, engrossing book that explains how important it is to be able to deal with ambiguity, and not to be always seeking closure.  Author Jamie Holmes points out early in the book that successfully dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty does not require a high IQ, but requires that one learns to master the emotional challenge of figuring out what to do when one has no idea what to do.  He states that he hopes to convince the reader of ""a simple claim"":  ""In an increasingly complex, unpredictable world, what matters most isn't IQ, willpower, or confidence in what we know.  It's how we deal with what we don't understand.""Those who don't or won't master that ambiguity challenge are more likely to ""jump to conclusions"", ""deny contradictions"", be mentally rigid, be prejudice and ""revert to stereotypes"", assert control elsewhere when losing control somewhere, be less creative, be more confident about an erroneous course of action, and be trusting of those who don't deserve trust and not trusting of those who do.  There are also three things that tend to make individuals less likely to successfully deal with uncertainty and, thus, need a quick closure--fatigue, urgency and stress. States Mr. Holmes: ""We have to reduce the messy world to manage it. But resolving something--fitting it into a metal box--also means that you stop scrutinizing it. Recognition means closure, and it marks the end of thinking, looking, and listening.""Embracing uncertainty, on the other hand, helps creativity and invention, deepens empathy, improves your ""odds of making rational decisions"", makes you less likely to fixate or clutch to ""one aspect of a complex and shifting reality"", and opens you to outside influences and traveling . . . which in turn feeds creativity and invention. As the author quoted Jerome Bruner:  Creativity often results ""when the ambiguity wins"".  Even mind traveling in books can be a big help, according to Mr. Holmes.  He says:  ""And it's why reading fiction--which puts us in other people's shoes--can both lower our need for closure and make us more empathetic."" (Interestingly, in novels, I prefer stories with closures, but I don't feel the same way about short stories.)On page 87 of Nonsense: The Power of Not Knowing is a ""closure test"" that the reader can take.  But don't imagine this book is a self-help one, because it's not.  It's more a book for those who like to think.  The author provides many interesting stories, too, to help the reader visualize both successful and unsuccessful attempts to deal with ambiguity.  Those stories include ones on:  A doomsday group in the 1950s; the incredible increase in marriages after the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco; the 1992 Ruby Ridge standoff; the 1993 Waco standoff; the 1973 Yom Kippur War; and the fallacy of more and more medical testing because ""the culture of medicine has little tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty"".In addition, there are stories about: The use of brain scans in criminal cases; the failure of the midi-skirt to replace the mini-skirt in the early 1970s; how ambiguity aversion leads to higher insurance premiums; Toyota; the Zara fashion store in New York;  Alexander Graham Bell; the Hand To Hand school in Jerusalem; bilinguals; Anton Chekhov; puzzles (""The act of puzzling is a protest against the mind's reduction of ambiguity.""); and how in the business world ""strategies with the greatest possibility of success also have the greatest possibility of failure"". (While reading that part of the book, I thought it was a shame Mr. Holmes did not look at Paul Reichmann and the Canary Wharf project--The Reichmanns: Family, Faith, Fortune, and the Empire of Olympia & York. In fact, Paul Reichmann's entire career as a builder would have been most interesting to explore in this book; since it is believed that the reason he took on so many projects with so many uncertainties was because, for him, there were no uncertainties where his religious beliefs were concerned.)When I reached the epilogue of the book, I was surprised.  One, because there were so many pages left.  It turns out the book has approximately 75 pages of notes.  Two, because it didn't feel like the book was concluding.  But I guess that is appropriate for a book that is proposing it is not good to constantly seek certainties and closures. Nonsense: The Power of Not Knowing actually reminds me in some ways of Kevin Ashton's How to Fly a Horse: The Secret History of Creation, Invention, and Discovery.  Both books were about creativity, both books made me think quite a bit, and both books used up a lot of my supplies in my Post-it Study Kit with Tabs, Flags, Arrow Flags, Note Tabs, Grid Notes, Full Adhesive Notes, Label Pads, and Flag + Highlighter. ( Kevin Ashton, though, sounded more like Thomas Edison, from Mr. Holmes' description, than Alexander Graham Bell. :) I also felt the great need to quote both authors in the reviews of their books.  Hence, let me end this review with two quotes that I liked from Jamie Holmes.  One:  ""The heroes of this book are all protesters, and they are protesting the premature destruction of the world's mystery.""  Two: ""Owning our own uncertainty makes us kinder, more creative, and more alive.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A5Z6PHLU5TNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348371#wasThisHelpful","R3A5Z6PHLU5TNP","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a rambling, repetitious book that proposes science is God, and one cannot believe in anything unproved by science if one wants to be known as a ""critical thinker"".  The author also preaches humility, which was amusing; since after reading the book, the ""about the author"" page, and some of Mr. Harrison's website, one has the feeling he would not recognize humility if it hit him in the face. Read instead Carl Sagan's The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark.  Even though it needed better editing and had a bit of a doomsday mentality, Dr. Sagan still did a much better job of doing what Guy Harrison tried to do with this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19OT4DURBNYGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880648#wasThisHelpful","R19OT4DURBNYGE","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second Nutro dry food I've tried this month.  The first one was a turkey formula that the cats ate the first day, but didn't particularly want from then on. Thinking a chicken formula would work better with them, since their usual food is a chicken one, I got this Nutro.  (Well, I actually ordered a high protein chicken formula, and got this hairball formula by mistake.)  Unfortunately, they wouldn't eat this one at all, except to taste a few bites at first.  I'm wondering if it's not too much fiber for them.  At 11%, this food has almost five times the amount of fiber than their usual dry food.(Note: I received a free 3 pound bag of this cat food by mistake from Amazon Vine in exchange for an honest review.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NDK38HAPBE8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZI42GG#wasThisHelpful","R1NDK38HAPBE8I","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While no one will ever convince me that plastic fans are as powerful as metal ones, this large Holmes totally plastic fan does put out a lot of air.  It also can be rotated to bounce the air off the floor or off the ceiling.  It has three speeds, a two blade plug, and a 2.5 Amp/5 Amp Max, 125 Volt fuse in the plug.  By no means, can it be considered to be a quiet fan, even on the lowest setting.  Hence, it's a good fan for those who like white noise, which I do.The two support feet hold this Holmes safely on the floor or on a table or dresser, but it does not have the heavier weight of fans with metal parts.  For example, right now I'm using a mostly metal Patton fan on a dresser.  I plan on replacing it with this fan, but am having second thoughts because I'm not sure if one of my cats was chasing another, the chased cat could run in back of this fan and knock it off the dresser.  Other than that, it's a safe fan around pets and children.Being made of 100% recycled material is great, too, but the buyer is obviously paying for that price wise.  So, right now it gets four stars and will keep four stars unless it disappoints me during the rest of the summer, or amazes me in some way or another, at which time I will update this review.  Oh, and make sure you keep it dusted, because it can't be opened to clean.

"It's always easy to tell a cheap faucet from an expensive one--namely, the weight.  This is one heavy bathroom faucet that is extremely well made.  I love the sharp modern design of it.  Even though it has a 6"" escutcheon for 3-hole sinks, it could not go in the dressing room I wanted it in, however; because I never really noticed how much space was between the faucet and the knobs, or that oval sinks would need a curved escutcheon.  The only sinks this faucet would fit were the downstairs powder and mud rooms.  That's okay, though, because it was perfect for the mud room, since that sink is white with a chrome frame.  Also, the fixtures in there were decades old and looked it.  It looks like this faucet was made specifically for that sink, and I expect it will last a long, long time.

"Ah, the 1920s . . . jazz . . . flappers . . .cars . . . money . . . sliced bread . . . mediums . . . seances . . . ectoplasm. Ectoplasm? If you don't know what ectoplasm is, you haven't read much about spiritualism in the 1920s. The 1920s was the golden decade for spiritualism in Europe and the United States. Due to all those who perished in World War I, as well as those who were killed by the influenza pandemic of 1918, organized religion no longer was providing enough answers and comfort to those who lost a loved one or many loved ones. People who normally would be asking God in prayers as to what was the meaning of so much death and suffering, instead began desiring to ask those who were now on the ""other side"". In other words, they were trying to contact the dead. And there soon was no shortage of mediums who claimed they could do exactly that, connecting anyone and everyone to the dearly departed.One of the most famous and influential persons who believed wholeheartedly in spiritualism was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a Scottish physician and writer, known for his Sherlock Holmes books. His oldest son survived the war, but died soon after of influenza and pneumonia. His death, along with the deaths of other family members, only strengthened Sir Arthur's desire to preach spiritualism, something he had been interested in since his twenties.  One of the most famous and influential persons who wholeheartedly denounced spiritualism was Harry Houdini, the greatest magician of his time. Houdini could not contact his father or mother after their deaths, and had seen all the tricks used by fake mediums to dupe those desperate to contact the deceased. He spent much of his lifetime exposing fake mediums, and even tried to get laws passed to lock them all up.The relationship between Sir Arthur and Houdini is one of the most interesting parts of this book. They were good friends at first. One reason being that they had certain things in common. According to author David Jaher, they both knew ""the humiliation of poverty"" and both wanted to ""redeem their fallen families and uplift their martyred mothers"". Sir Arthur also felt Harry Houdini could do supernatural things, even though Houdini repeatedly tried to show him it was all trickery. Houdini's crusade to expose mediums brought an end to their warm friendship. For Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was as much zealously dedicated to promoting spiritualism as Harry Houdini was zealously dedicated to destroying it.Then, enters Mina Crandon, the woman pictured on the book cover, who was ""the witch"" of Lime Street. She was no witch, however, but strictly a medium; one who was greatly impressing many of those associated with a contest by the magazine Scientific American, where a $2,500 award was being offered to anyone who could legitimately produce ""physical phenomena"". (Another $2,500 was offered for legitimate ""spirit photography"".) Supposedly. Mrs. Crandon had no interest in mediumship until she was told during a seance that she was a natural medium. Her husband, however, was highly interested in it and had even discussed it with Sir Oliver Lodge, another well-known spiritualist. Her husband was a prominent doctor, much older than his third wife, and provided young Mrs. Crandon with a much more comfortable life than she had ever known.Was Mina Crandon a real medium, truly contacting her late brother, who so often highly entertained those at her seances? Or was she a total fake, but a very talented one, as Harry Houdini claimed? That question goes on and on throughout much of the book. It's not a short read, goes into great details, and keeps the reader wondering if ""the witch of Lime Street"" was truly a gifted medium, not a gifted fraud. Much of the book is also about Harry Houdini's life, which should please his fans. Moreover, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle comes across very well, if not gullible at times, and doesn't end up seeming at least a little creepy like so many others in the book end up seeming, including Houdini.By the end of the book, the reader is well-versed in spiritualism, mediumship, magic, trickery, creepiness, and the undying hope held by many that those who have died are still alive elsewhere. By the end of the book, Harry Houdini is dead, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is dead, and spiritualism is all but dead to most people. The wealth of the 1920s is gone and the Great Depression has started. One can only guess the mediums and the spirits could not provide needed physical comfort to those who were still alive on Earth, such as food, clothes, shelter and jobs.(Note: I received a free e-copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher, as well as a hard copy from Amazon Vine, in exchange for an honest review.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JTIV6SWMPHKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012YSQMFW#wasThisHelpful","R2JTIV6SWMPHKS","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is actually the first video game I have ever played.  I'm against them, especially for children, especially for very young children. I think they make them hyper.  Yet, after playing this one, I can see the educational benefits of it, as well as the fun a young child can have with it. With this game, using the LeapFrog LeapTV Educational Gaming System, which has a camera you place on the TV stand, the child is on the screen in the game! The characters from Frozen (2013) are all so vivid and colorful, too.  Leap TV has obviously put a lot of work and brains into their games and system.There are ads, apps and a shopping cart visible in the system, so they are trying to sell games to kids, though, or maybe that's just for the parents and grandparents of young children.  Setting up the system was a bear, too, since it made it look like you needed to connect to your Wi-Fi network, using your security password, which actually you don't need to do to play this game. (I didn't notice the skip button. But that's another review.)  I'm still not sold on video games, but as stated earlier, I do see some of the benefits, including teaching eye-hand coordination . . . which I seemed to be sorely lacking while using the transforming controller. :)P.S.

"The Georgian Menagerie: Exotic Animals in Eighteenth-Century London is described as ""entertaining and enlightening"".  I think it would have been better described as ""educational, and entertaining only if you find cruelty to animals entertaining"".  From cages to chains; from malnutrition to starvation; from freezing to death to perishing in fires; from being tormented by owners to being tormented by spectators; from ending up in soups to ending up as wig grease; it's all there for your ""entertainment"".  That's what the exotic birds and animals were mostly doing in London--entertaining the masses.  Or entertaining those who could afford to own them, such as royalty.Not everyone was unkind or indifferent to animals, of course.  When animals would harm or kill humans, they usually were not ordered destroyed by the courts, but instead their owners were fined very small fines.  Loose, rampaging animals were usually the only ones destroyed.  Yes, if you prefer reading about the harm that sometimes happened to owners, trainers, keepers and sightseers of exotic animals, not to mention innocent pedestrians, go straight to Chapter 8 : ""Bitten, Crushed & Maimed"". Be forewarned, though, some of those attacked were children. My favorite tale in that chapter was the one about an elephant named Miss D'Jek who got revenge on her mean keeper one day.In all fairness, the book is not all dreary and depressing.  For example, parrot lovers may find it more ""enlightening"" than others.  Actually, the book did exactly what it claimed to do on page 213: ""The Georgian Menagerie"" has revealed the life of the city's animal merchants and bird sellers, and the significance that the birds and animals they sold held for those who owned and saw them. The diaries and letters of Londoners and visitors to the city, in addition to wills, insurance records, court records, newspapers and broadsheets reveal a city bursting with exotic birds and animals.""  Now, how well the reader can stomach those revelations will greatly depend on how well the reader can stomach tales of cruelty to birds and animals.(Note: I received a free e-copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZ15DMSZWTAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1784530840#wasThisHelpful","R3TZ15DMSZWTAY","A3FS3FJPD3RJTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FS3FJPD3RJTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My cats reacted to this food as they do to all new dry food I try on them--they love it at first, but then prefer their usual dry food again.  Turkey is the first ingredient in this Nutro formula, with chicken meal being the second. From there it's two types of rice, pea protein, oatmeal, potatoes, dried beet pulp and alfalfa meal.  Alfalfa meal?  Like in rabbit food?  No corn or wheat, but are peas, potatoes, beets and alfalfa that much better for a cat?  And while it has no soybean protein, it does have soybean oil.

"This is an odd disjointed first person narrative of a junior officer serving in the last days of the US occupation of Iraq. The writing is odd, to say the least. Its full of bizarre metaphors and similes few of which convey any meaning. Instead, they seem to exist just to make the writing sound like literature. Also the book has an odd style. The author does almost no visual descriptions of people, places or layouts, but goes into, time and time again, smells. We read he goes into a place and it smell of maggots. Another place smells of balls. So we get an olfactory tour of conflict in Iraq rather than a usual visual one.The settings jump about too like an amateur horror flick (now Im doing it too). The author and his group are trailing along behind an armored vehicle and then next second hes on his face but also on the second story of a building. He enters a mosque to kill or capture a guy in a minaret. Next sentence hes waking up near the minaret or maybe not. Something happened. A rocket hit? A grenade? Were never sure.His motives arent clearly explained either. He decides he wishes to blow the whistle on someone who may have been part of an American death squad which murdered some civilians, but no reason why he got all obsessed about supposed crimes which may have occurred years ago. He then grows obsessed with an American soldier, now declared dead, who was respected by the Iraqis. Then he grows overwhelmingly obsessed with the latter soldiers now married ex-girlfriend.The one thing made clear in the book is the hopelessness of the entire war. Everything the Americans do make things worse no matter how well intended they are. If the book was a narrative on events in the war, it rates poorly. If its a narrative on hopeless pointless police action and why so many soldiers who served there today are broken men suffering from PTSD and more, it hits the target square.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N3F61EUCW6LQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501105744#wasThisHelpful","R2N3F61EUCW6LQ","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got good if limited results from this product, provided to me as a manufacturers sample, but  it will likely work better for most others. Let me explain.I have significant skin damage caused by my having lived aboard and sailed a small boat for a total of eight years. I never wore sun screen or used lotion. The combination of salt air, regular drenching of salt water and constant sun has taken its toll on my facial skin etching deep lines which likely were made worse by my constant squinting while on watch.  This etching is a good deal deeper than normal age related wrinkles.The upshot is that I got no visible change in the amount of this etching which exists around my eyes. I do think that if Id not have had the sea / sun / salt background, Id have experienced better results. I say that because the JK Vitamin C serum (odd appellation there) did significantly improve the general tone of my skin where used. My skin, while still wrinkled, appears better. I sort of glow with good health due to this products use.I think this is a five star product for most, but I can only report my experience with it and that was only partly successful. As I said at the outset, I think that those who have had a more conventional life experience will have better success with this product.

"This is a dandy scale. The manufacturers sample sent here is well-made and good looking which does everything one would wish a kitchen scale would do. It can weigh things absolutely or TARE or the weight of an item less the weight of the container. The controls are easy to use. There is an on / off / zero switch and another switch to change units which are, grams, milliliters, pounds / ounces (dry), fluid ounces. The fluid measurements are accurate with water or liquids having the same specific density as water but less so with others.Accuracy, especially in lesser weights, is vital to the utility of a scale. When tested with known weights and against a known good scale, the Accuweight proved perfect. There was no variance between the known weights and the values shown in the easy to read LCD display.One issue may have arisen due to the smaller diameter active weighing area of the Accuweight which measures 6 inches or 15 cm. When I tried weighing a known weight pot having a one foot / 30 cm diameter, the scale proved perfectly accurate. The reason is that the active area of the scale protrudes slightly above the bezel meaning that no matter the size of the vessel being measured, the Accuweight will produce accurate results.Small, light, accurate and with all the features needed in a food / general purpose scale  who can ask for more? Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R146FPX381ZAMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WU0G1W#wasThisHelpful","R146FPX381ZAMQ","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These pans are single use double aluminum pans with an absorbent layer between the solid bottomed and perforated upper pan.  The idea is that you bake bacon (or other foodstuff) placing it in the perforated pan and the fats or other liquid given off in the cooking process goes through the perforations and gets trapped in the absorbent layer. It works as designed.  My test trial with bacon yielded bacon that was as fat free as bacon that had been baked or fried and then drained on paper towels.There are some drawbacks - at least for me, but maybe not for you. The first and foremost for me is that these cannot be washed before use. To do so would saturate the absorbent layer making the pans just plain pans.  So you use these as the come and they dont come sealed. Here we have pans made somewhere, transported somehow, warehoused somehow and all the while being handled by people who arent anywhere near kitchen clean. This wouldnt be a big deal if they came sealed from the factory but they are open to anything. Presumably, the cooking process sterilizes them, but gee, would you feel comfortable knowing rodents may have crawled over your cookware and you used them for cooking without washing? I dont.Second is capacity. The test bacon was standard Hormel brand bacon. Each pan holds four bacon strips. Since there are 16 bacon strips in a standard 1 lb bacon package, that means that these three pans cant cook a pound of bacon. OK, theyre not expensive but neither are a few paper towels to use as drains or even a cloth towel you later wash.Lastly they are single use and are not recyclable at least in our city. The reason is the fat saturated middle layer disqualifying them from our recycle program. Again, this wont bother all and for all I know, Im the weird one feeling odd about putting aluminum in the landfill but thats my way.In the test, I cooked the Hormel bacon at 400 F for 20 minutes on the top shelf of the oven. The result was delicious  as good a bacon as Ive ever eaten. So the outcome was great but the drawbacks cause me a good deal of hesitation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DBJJEHAPHWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UN39MI#wasThisHelpful","R24DBJJEHAPHWD","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The manufacturers sample received here is a rugged and reliable performer. It consists of a solar collector, a light and a weatherproofed switch which works in series  low, high, off plus a stake for putting in the ground and some fasteners if you wish to attach this to a wall or overhang or what have you.As luck would have it, the weather during the test phase was nasty so the InaRock first got soaked with rain for a few days, then the rain froze giving it an ice jacket and finally it got a bit of snow. The function remained perfect even after this onslaught.The weather was mostly cloud covered during the test period so I left it out to charge for two days turned off. Then I turned it on low because in addition to the clouds, the light was located where it could only get light for half a day. Even so, the light managed enough of a charge to operate on low for the entire night. While the light is supposed to turn off during day time, it tended to remain on for a bit of day during morning gloom caused by some fog and dense cloud cover early on.

"This is a complex, unrealistic, muddled combination of 10% police procedural and 90% internecine squabbling.  Heres the setup. A bunch of Muslims have migrated into Canada and now plan on repaying the kind hospitality of Canadians by killing as many said Canadians as they can using some fertilizer bombs. A police informer has been killed infiltrating this plot so now we have two investigations. The first is to thwart the plot and the second to find the killer of the informer. The plot thwart element is mostly concealed from the reader.The clues tend to be the most laughably obscure oblique poetry references. For example, a bad guy says something about mud and crime. A good guy comes up, instantly, with the idea that that line is similar to a line in a poem and so he, the good guy, figures out, based on the theme of that poem, what the bad guy is about. That sort of off the wall, never-can-really-happen event pops up regularly and in fact, is a major plot point at the very end of the book.Most of the book consists of people blah blahing about their relationships. The police work against each other as do the members of the plot who have their base in a mosque. There is a brother and sister who constantly dispute. A bumbling, dimwitted inept sergeant who tries to infiltrate the mosque and who seems to be more concerned with saving some overtly guilty bomb plotters from punishment because they are young than anything else. Along the way we get a good deal of the Muslim complaint about the West invading their lands and mucking with their culture as justification for the bomb plot. Yeah. So some Saudis attack America, America in return attacks Iraq and therefore its logical and right that an Iraqi led plot exists to kill Canadians.  This is the road to peace and goodwill.By the time I was done with this book I was disgusted with every character and had no sympathy for any of them. I did have a great deal of sympathy for the innocent Canadians who were the target of the plot and wished they had a reasonably able police force to protect them from this threat.

"There are two features which cause these headphones, supplied to me as a manufacturers sample,  to soar above the competition. The first is the ergonomic. They have large ear cups which will accommodate all ear sizes. The mic folds neatly into an ear cup  a much better design than those which either detach or just swing out of the way. The headphones are light and so have all day comfort. I know since Ive worn these for hours straight in perfect comfort. Finally, the controls are large and easy to access including a true rheostat to control volume and an on/off switch for the mic.Tested on a Windows 7 desktop, a Windows 10 laptop and a Chromebook. There were no functional issues detected on any of these three platforms.So the design is as good as Ive ever seen in a headphone aimed at gamers, but there is a good deal more. These headphones, unlike most gaming phones, reproduce music and voice wonderfully. They could be marketed at such and be a success. I was really amazed at how good these sound.Like a few other higher end audio headphones, these have a significant bias (equalization) built in to give the phones a major bass boost and an overall very round, rich and full sound. Its not a faithful reproduction such as youd get from a reference headphone but one which the vast majority of people will prefer over the flat non-biased headphone or speaker. In addition to the fullness of the sound and bass boost, these headphones exhibit a sound clarity well beyond my expectations.This is easily a five star product and I can recommend it without reservations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K0AYELMY34NC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TRHOC0#wasThisHelpful","R3K0AYELMY34NC","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are reasonably attractive earrings, but I think they could be better. The first minor issue I have is that the stud isnt centrally located but rather on one end of the piece. This means the earring hangs down below the earlobe rather than being centered on the lobe. I would have preferred the centered look.The sterling silver treatment is great. It is an antiqued or tarnished look giving a very attractive patina to the metal parts of the earring. The turquoise is treated with epoxy and likely colored epoxy at that. This gives the stone part a fakey-doo look because its too uniform in color and consistency to look like a stone. It is a stone, or a composite stone but it could be plastic based solely on the uniformity of color.Since the stone is the center of the earrings, I am at best lukewarm about these despite liking the silver treatment very much. I live in an area where you can find turquoise just laying around on the ground  albeit not jewel quality, but it is turquoise so Im a bit more sensitive about this material than most.One final comment: before choosing these, be sure to check the size carefully. These are relatively small as ear studs go meaning theyll work very well for some but not so well for others.One note on this review. The opinions are mine but the person wearing the earring where I formed the opinion is my wife.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NO2RSMI4RMD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S4HBGAY#wasThisHelpful","R3NO2RSMI4RMD5","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To gush about a garbage can strikes me as silly even while I do it, but I will. I really am enjoying the simplehuman stainless garbage can. The reasons are two: design and execution of that design.The material is beautiful stainless steel claimed to be, and proved by me to be, fingerprint proof. The stamping and assembly are flawless. The liner top folds over the top of the can but a stainless collar fits over the fold making the can seem from the outside not to have a liner. Cant have the unsightly plastic liner ruin the otherwise clean lines of this can, now can we?The can comes with a few sample liners from simplehuman which fit the can perfectly. There is a liner storage compartment attached to the rear of the can with the liners accessible from the inside of the can making for easy deployment. While the custom liners fit perfectly and are of extremely high quality, I also tried some generic 13 gallon liners and found they did fit well and would suffice if you choose not to go with the proprietary liners.Step on the foot pedal and the lid opens. Remove your foot and the lid closes but its damped so the lid falls slowly mating with the rest of the can silently. No banging or clanging here.This is clearly a luxury good. Sure, you can find a way to hold your liners rigid for a good deal less money but you cant get the sense of everything right that way either. Were moving, one appliance at a time, to a stainless kitchen. The simplehuman rectangular step trash can has found a highly welcomed home here. It looks great, works perfectly and is a joy to use. It may sound odd to praise such a prosaic item such as a garbage can so highly, but to me, any item which has had this much care lavished on it in design, materials and assembly is brings delight every time its used.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23NY087A3ASE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXXPJBU#wasThisHelpful","R23NY087A3ASE9","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no idea such a product existed so when offered a manufacturer's sample, I accepted. I drive a 16 year old truck which has no provision for playing music from a smartphone but does have a cassette slot.The system is simple. The only adjustment possible is to move the wire from exiting one side of the cassette body to the other. To do this loosen a few small screws, move the wire and tighten the screws again.The device works. The sound is a bit dull as if you listen while wearing ear muffs. Also while in use, the tape transport motor runs which I suppose is all right since the same motor would run if using a regular cassette. I tested with an iPhone 6 and a G5 iPad. I feel sure it'll work with any device that outputs signal through the standard 3.5 mm phone port.In an ideal world, I'd like a brighter sound and the transport motor not to run, but still, it does work and adds a nice entertainment dimension to older vehicles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KNJAUMTF4DRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CPRGWU#wasThisHelpful","R3KNJAUMTF4DRM","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used shrink to fit plastic cable management systems in the past which worked, but which are difficult to use and awkward to remove. So when offered a sample of a reusable cable management system by the manufacturer, I eagerly accepted the offer.The system is flat piece of cloth with a zipper. Wrap a bundle of wires, fasten the zipper and the result is a neat thick black cable bundle which is a good deal neater and less visible than the individual wires.Although I have large, clumsy hands, I had no problems whatsoever bundling and then zipping close the sleeves. In fact, it was rather an enjoyable experience to get the wires behind my home entertainment system organized into barely noticeable bundles as oppose to the spaghetti monster they seemed like when loose.This system is a major improvement over the shrink to fit system and one which is a pleasure to use. The result is highly pleasing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BDFCUL57RETQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HWXG4M#wasThisHelpful","R1BDFCUL57RETQ","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are extremely warm and well-made gloves. While marketed for winter sports such as skiing or snowboarding, I planned on using them for motorcycle and bicycle riding so when the manufacturer offered me a pair as a sample, I requested them in yellow for visibility. Note: I do not recommend these to you for either riding purposes due to them not being armored. The manufacturer does not market them for these purposes either.All those disclaimers aside, the gloves did work well for both riding situations indicating that theyd do very well for winter sports. They were as warm as you want for bicycle riding - maybe too warm. They are reasonably windproof even at faster riding speeds which exceed speeds one would find on the slopes. The piping is reflective  important for road use by meaningless for general winter sports. I found these almost too warm for use while walking even in sub-freezing temperatures.Im generally an XL glove size. The L size received here were a bit tight so figure they run true to size. If youre looking for a winter sports glove or one for general use such as walking or snow shoveling in very low temperatures, these would be a good choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4AQY3YKA75JR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0171A8UKS#wasThisHelpful","R4AQY3YKA75JR","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As it arrived, the headphones worked well as a standard gaming headphone tried in a variety of old and new games. The only minor drawback was that the Up and Down Volume buttons only work on Android devices which leaves at least some of us out in the cold, but no big deal.The mic plugs in to the bottom of the right ear cup using a standard 3.5 mm plug. Its already fallen out a few times when I put the headphone down on a table.  I clip on the headphone to stow the mic when not in use would be welcome but not nearly as welcome as the more common retracting mic.A really big deal is the surround sound or rather lack of it. The headphones dont magically created surround sound. Instead, this demands a driver from the Lenovo site. A visit there turned out to be a journey of frustration. The headphones arent listed as a Lenovo product and all tries at contacting the company to ask what was up hit a dead end.Finally I found a 24/7 Online Chat option.  Clicking on it said something like Sorry We Missed You and then the notice that the online chat is only operational during certain hours. So much for 24/7 online chats. Also I was online during those hours and in fact in the middle of them.I wasted a half hour on that site going in loops and finally hitting the online chat wall. As the expression goes, theres time Ill never get back.This might be an intriguing product if it worked. I have no idea because clearly Lenovo is selling a product that it doesnt even know it has cataloged.  Note the date of this review. I suggest before buying check the Lenovo site to see if the driver exists. If not, hold off until it shows up.Update: Tried online chat again. I was told an 8 minute wait. After 25 minutes where I got down to #2 and then back up to #3 maybe three times, I got a person. I was told that this was sales only and no help. I was instructed to call another 24/7 line  voice phone.  A call there proved fruitless.This may be a decent product but vended by a garbage company. Im cured of ever using Lenovo again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R8VRUKOE1S7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01133CPMI#wasThisHelpful","R3R8VRUKOE1S7D","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The sound produced by the Crossfades is so rich that it will spoil you for other listening sources. It may also cost you money or time or both because youll wish to upgrade your digital library to rid it of lower bit rate rips. Yes, you can tell the difference.The sound is not neutral but rather is equalized to a degree that will please almost anybody except those who demand utterly flat reproduction. The best word, and forgive me for using it, is orotund to describe the sound. Its rich and full, and also exhibits extreme clarity. I heard elements in my music that Id not known were there. If you were to tell me there is a better headphone available, youd have to prove it. I think these are state of the art in any headphone and wireless as well.The bass is astounding and blends into the mid-range seamlessly. The treble is crystal clear which gives a good deal of the great clarity. This headphone will outperform, in Bluetooth, most, if not all, wired headphones. Add the supplied wire (which also has  mic) and it gets just a bit better.They move a lot of air too. I find roughly half volume as much as I can take on most devices. More and my eardrums would compress driving my eyeballs across the room. You are warned.The fit and comfort are great. Some may find the standard ear cups a bit small. If so, V-Moda offers a much more cushioned and larger ear cup which will improve comfort for anybody but to a major degree for those with large ears. There are other options available as well such as different side dcor. The standard chrome dcor is a fingerprint magnet.The Crossfade Wireless is lighter than many wired headphones despite having to accommodate the electronics for Bluetooth. The construction is rugged showing, for example, braided wiring where its exposed. Expect these to last a good long time.There are four control buttons. A multifunction to change tracks or deal with phone calls, a volume up and volume down button as well as a slider to turn the device on and set it to pair. The slider button does not protrude above the housing making it somewhat fussy to operate. The three control buttons have only slight raised markings making them difficult for me to locate and implement while the headphone is on. Its gotten better for me now after maybe 10 or 12 hours use.The box it comes in makes a grand presentation as youd expect from a headphone of this cost. If you have an audiophile giftee, these would make a great experience both for the gifter and giftee come Christmas morning.The headphones paired easily and quickly with a Windows 10 computer, a Chromebook and several iDevices from Apple. I experienced no functional issues whatsoever.I dont want to sound silly but Im telling you that these phones are a different experience in listening. I suppose you can get most of what these can do for less money because all high end items get into diminishing returns. Then again, to engineer a room and then equip it with speakers to match the sound of these Crossfade Wireless headphones could cost a brutal amount of money making the cost of these peanuts by comparison.If you want the very best in wireless headphones youve found them. Nothing in my experience comes close to matching them. Nothing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WG8AYSBPWQQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015R7AGHC#wasThisHelpful","R1WG8AYSBPWQQH","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a slightly padded shelf liner material which is red with dark dots on one side and white with red threads in a square pattern on the other side. The material is thick enough to give a bit of a cushion to the liners you cut from the bulk rolls.Measuring and cutting are made much easier by the dots. Measure to a dot, then cut along the dotted line. This caused me, an indifferent seamstress type, to be able to cut dead straight pieces in both directions.If you choose to go with this product, be sure to measure your needs before ordering. Without measuring but just seat of pants, I figured two rolls would do much of not all of my small 1953 era kitchen, but it only did about 35%.The product straight from the roll doesnt lay down flat. This doesnt affect function but it does appearance. See the photo which shows my after cabinet. I ran a full size piece through a normal washing machine cycle and it came out fine. The colors didnt run or stain the whites also in the wash. After, the piece did lay down a bit flatter. If the buckling bothers you, I suggest you run your pieces through the wash and weight down after to press flat.Nothing remarkable to say here in form or function. I think the red liner makes my white inside painted cabinets look better and I also like the quiet of when you put dishes down on the stuff.

"This is another in the Amazon Basics line. Ive bought many Basics products and found them all to be a good deal better than what Id expect from a generic item although, I suppose, Amazon itself is now a brand. Still, I think if this as a generic because the brand is the same as the vendor.The set is three pots and two frying sort of pans. The pots all have lids and the lids each have a vent. The largest lid also fits the smaller fry pan. The large fry pan is the only item lacking a lid.Construction is fairly heavy aluminum with a truly superb non-stick coating for the cooking surface. The handles are soft touch which stay cool even after an hour on the burner. The handles are extraordinarily comfortable and non-slip as well.The surface which touches the burners has dots (see photograph) which may be functional or decorative. Im not clear on it. Anyway, the units all heat quickly as youd expect from aluminum and also distribute the heat perfectly. I browned some meatballs in the larger fry pan and noted no difference in browning if the meatball was in the center or edges of the pan.The fry pans are shallow having walls of only about 1.75 or 4.5 cm height. The walls are curved so you can do the one handed flip if you are good in the kitchen. None of the pots or pans has a spout for easy pouring.Ive never used a non-stick fry pan before. I expected some instructions on conditioning the set but none were included so I just washed them and then put them into service. Note: I cook with cast iron and have been carrying two such pans around with me for years now. I used to consider them non-stick until I tried the Amazon Basic fry pan. I just threw a few meatballs made with beef and egg into the pan on high. I figured Id get some sticking, but there was none. The few bits of food which seemed to cling to the pan washed off with nothing but the water stream from my standard kitchen faucet.I cant fault these performance-wise. I would have liked to have pour spouts on at least the sauce pots and fry pans as well as a lid for the larger fry pan. The bottom line is how they perform and thats where these win and win big. Im sold on non-stick pans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24ZPOVO0G91ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RLCOW8#wasThisHelpful","R24ZPOVO0G91ND","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stuff is terrific and the value here is tremendous too. We use this not only as a skin lotion, but as a cooking oil. In fact, it's become our go to cooking oil. It's not as high temperature as either refined coconut oil or that old standby peanut oil but it works well enough to get the job done frying or stir frying. It also smells nice and we're convinced it's a healthier oil than most alternatives. I suggest you do your own research and decide for yourself if the claims and findings about coconut oil are convincing.Contrary to what you may think, this will not suffuse your food with a coconut taste.

"Coconut this or that seems to be the Thing of the Day - at least for now. This set of shampoo and conditioner has coconut in it which doesn't seem to add or subtract anything I can see. I tried both and found results as I'd expect from good quality products.A better test was use by my wife who reported, like me, good results. I thought her long fine hair was a bit softer and silkier than usual after using this product set. So for sure, score at least one point for this.The only issue I had was that the conditioner pump arrived in a non-functional state. It wouldn't pop up to be in pumping position. A quick trip out to the garage shop addressed this. It was just stuck badly, but there wasn't any non-tool way to free it.A good solid product which, if you want or don't care about a coconut add in will serve well.

"For a mystery / thriller book to succeed it needs at least two elements missing here in Run. It needs to be plausible within the context the author sets and the protagonist must be one we wish to do well.The protagonist has no likable characteristics. He's an utterly self-centered snob who worries constantly about stuff such as furniture or art. For example, in the middle of a chase (the book is mostly made up of chases) he'll observe with disdain how a house is furnished with IKEA - which I suppose is a bad thing. He obsesses over the laughable fake art of Roy Lichtenstein which is more an illustration of our times' degeneration than anything else.The plausibility isn't. This guy, some sort of database designer who has no training and isn't in good physical shape, constantly outdoes dozens of police as well as trained agents from Homeland Security. At one point, he's trapped in a room inside a grocery store where both the room and store are surrounded by police and Homeland Security agents out to capture him. He escapes using a trick loosely stolen from a Steven Seagal movie, Under Siege and just happens to find a truck he casually drives away in. He wrecks others' property casually leaving a misery in his wake.More: he manages to overcome, at close quarters, two highly trained professional killers / agents. He always seems to know in advance what sort of equipment he'll need so he just happens to grab something that later in the chase is necessary for him to survive or pull some other stunt.Worse, he's a fool. The entire book's chain of events is set in motion at the very start by him being a complete bozo only matched in bozo-ness by his annoying wife. They get into a fight which, by content, infers they have IQ's less than their shoe sizes.In sum, a fast paced breathless series of chases interspersed with exposition where all players try to figure out why they're chasing around.

"This is everything I'd hoped for in a second flush Darjeeling tea. The aroma is delightfully floral as hoped for and the taste just a bit more robust grape like flavor than first flush which is both lighter and more astringent.On that topic, I want to post a caution about this tea. If you brew it too long, it will grow, in my opinion, unpleasantly astringent. Here, I've noted that the 3 minute mark is the outer limit for brew times or that overlay comes to bear. Of course, if you like that in a tea, then brew it for a full four minutes but I prefer leaving the delicate aroma and taste along and not bring that to bear.In sum, this is really good stuff and also bears the seal saying it's genuine Darjeeling.

"Supersymmetry is an absurd sort of scifi thriller book which, in some ways, is like the old scifi from the golden age.  People back then would retire to a lab and within a few days make a space ship which would take off and function perfectly. Here we have people doing things like writing complex computer programs while chatting up a storm and finding the programs work first time without a trial / debugging cycle. Not even one. Nice work if you can get it. Other laughable events occur every few pages. For example, in one minor incident, simple machines learn how to manipulate and understand quantum mechanics by reading RFID cards.Back in the golden age, atomic power was going to solve everything. Today it's quantum this and quantum that. So here we have nonsensical explanations all supposedly due to the quanta allow people to behave like some out of control swords and sorcery bunch. They think up a new power and then slam bang they can do it from splitting themselves into as many as 40 individuals to teleporting to time travel. Well, why not - it's after all a probable multiverse.As a hard science book, this one lost me at the very start when the top scientist explained he's holding a universe captive by projecting an energy field. Well, there is no such thing and there can't be because energy is a measurement of work capacity similar to a kilometer being a measure of distance. One would `t say with a straight face ""I'm projecting a kilometer field"" and one can't say that about an energy field. It's absurd.From time to time in the book, the players, when the action gets frantic (which is about every 10 pages) stop and start wasting time with sophomoric philosophizing. I think the author has been too much influenced by Star Trek which does the same silly thing time and time again.I'll grant it's an exciting ride but so are some swords and sorcery books where, to save everything, the good guy at the last minute remembers the Lost Spell. Here, we get the same thing but wrapping itself up in a pretend hard science disguise. An interesting fusion of magicks mixed with a lot of physics jargon which tends to run completely off the rails at the end. It's a fast trip to a merry improbable conclusion.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E3SSJIL7YW1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880982#wasThisHelpful","R1E3SSJIL7YW1I","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This meter works perfectly as a TDS monitor. While to be truly accurate, you'd have to calibrate it using a few known (high and low TDS) solutions as it comes in the box, it works well to give a comparative reading.I tested the manufacturer supplied sample against tap water finding a TDS reading of 152 ppm. Run the water through a filter and the meter, after being rinsed with distilled water, read 5 ppm. Shows how effective a filter can be for your drinking water.The device is supposed to be a temperature monitor also but I couldn't see how this worked.

"I'm awarding this manufacturer's supplied sample of the ThermoPro TP-11 four stars because while it it works well, the calibration is off enough to result in an overcooked (in the case of the sample received here) meal. The reason I feel so good about this product is that it does perform as advertised which, sadly to say, isn't always the case with these remote cooking thermometers meant for grill cooking.Cut to the chase: the transmission of data from the sender to the receiver unit worked at a distance of 50 feet (15 m) through structural brick outside walls and plaster on lath inside walls. Other units tried failed this test.The issue is one of accuracy. You need to calibrate this unit before testing. I checked the temperature readout against a calibrated Thermoworks Thermopen finding that within the cooking range (120F - 185F) the ThermoPro TP-11 read from 4 to 6 degrees F low. So, if yours is like the sample sent me by the manufacturer, you'll end up overcooking your food if you believe the readings on the TP-11.Note: No probe can tolerate having its cable crushed by a grill lid.

"This is a review in two parts. The first is about the edition CEB Deep Blue Kids' Bible and the second about this translation.Part 1The CEB Deep Blue Kid's Bible is a superb effort at making scripture easily accessible. I've rarely seen the like of it. There are summaries of all the books and the actual textual matter is laced with various callouts expanding one's knowledge of text. I found many of these callouts to be quite thought provoking. In addition, there are many notes and reference materials to clarify the text. I particularly enjoyed learning from the glossary and the section dealing with biblical weights, measurements and money.For example, one callout dealt with the two stories of creation which mystifies many. The callout suggests that these two exist because two different authors also existed and each had a different take on what happened so now you have two ways to look at the biblical account of creation. Neat.My only gripe about this production relates to the goofy cartoon children which frolic through the pages. These look like Pixar kids and add nothing to the book's value. Worse, they subtract from it.This bible is suitable for all ages but is labeled as being for ages 8 - 12. Drop the silly cartoons which would embarrass an adult and you have a book which will bring scripture to all.Part 2The CEB (Common English Bible) put my teeth on edge at least once per page.  I have no quibble with the accuracy of the translation but the grammar and word usage chosen are terrible to my way of thinking. This translation takes the bible by the neck and wrings all the nobility and majesty from it. Let me give you a few examples:Genesis:KJV: Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.CEB: The snake was the most intelligent of all the wild animals that the Lord God had made.Esther:KJV:  Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.CEB: This very day, the important women of Persia and Media who hear about the queen will tell the royal officials the same thing. There will be no end of put-downs and arguments. (put-downs?)PsalmsKJV: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.CEB: The Lord is my shepherd. I lack nothing.Sure, the Elizabethan usage in  KJV is difficult for us today but it's not Chaucer either.  It takes some effort but it pays off in reading soaring, majestic wonderful English rather than flat declarative boring phrases.In sum, the work and added material in this bible are superb making it suitable and highly desirable for not only 8 to 12, but 8 to any age. However, I am a bit of a traditionalist and cannot abide the butchering (as I see it) of the bible by sinking to the lowest level vulgate in this translation.I enjoyed my time so far with the added material here and learned a good deal too. I plan on spending a good deal more time with the book too. There is a good deal of superb material. Five stars plus for the added material and production values. For me, though, I can't award the entire work five stars because of the flat, boring almost nasty (to my narrow way of thinking) translation. Your milage may vary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HIS2VM064J20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609261917#wasThisHelpful","R1HIS2VM064J20","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dennis Lims book on David Lynch has an achievement of sorts: by the time I was done reading it, Id had all I wanted to be fed about Lynch, his life and is work. Some may call Lynch an opportunistic artiste while others the product of a degenerate society who himself is a vanguard of that degeneracy. Either or neither may be correct in whole but both are surely correct in parts.To be fair to Lynch, he was born into a society and exists in same that would reject a painting called Thanksgiving Dinner at the Jones but celebrate a painting called Tommy Jones Stabbed in the Eye by His Mom at Thanksgiving Dinner.  So his disgusting images, as described all too well by Lim, in his initial film Eraserhead and elsewhere, are easy to explain existing. After all, his first artistic recognition was a multimedia presentation called Six Men Getting Sick and that seems to have set the tone of Lynchs future media work. Six Men is available for viewing on YouTube.I am not familiar with Lynchs work and got this book to learn about Lynch as someone Id heard of but didnt know.  I also viewed a few episodes of Twin Peaks which may be Lynchs most well-known work and one now back in production for showing about a year from this writing.  Based on this limited exposure, Id say that Lim has chosen to emphasize the repulsive aspects of Lynchs work and gloss over other aspects.For example, Twin Peaks is soaked in teen angst as well as high school politics. These are common tropes which arent covered or even mentioned in the book. In addition, there is a good deal of plain old scenic videography like a travelogue. So I make a bit of a leap here and wonder if non-revolting aspects of other Lynch works are likewise left out.Still, the final test of a critical analysis / biography such as Lims book is if, at the end, you are left wanting more. I wasnt and thats good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35EN0G1B8PWD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544343751#wasThisHelpful","R35EN0G1B8PWD1","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an ideal six outlet charger for most USB devices. The manufacturer's sample received here is exceptionally well made. It has a remarkably solid and heavy feel to it. While such a feel doesn't necessarily mean superior function, I prefer using devices that give the sense they were carved from a billet - even if that's not the case. Aesthetics count at least some, but function is foremost.Function with the Foxnovo is near ideal. Each port is capable of 2.4 A or the full 12 watts but being 'smart' these ports throttle down in the case of devices which can't tolerate such amperage. We decided to test the charger by loading it up completely with six devices which were a mix of iPhone, iPad, Kindle, Samsung G5 and two Bluetooth headsets. All were charged well and with no sign of any overcharging.A few people who have Samsung devices, such as the G6, which can be fast charged using a special Samsung protocol may find a a lack in this charger because it lacks such a port. For those folks, the Foxnovo will work well but not as fast as one having this service. For the vast majority of people who have common USB charged devices, the Foxnovo is perfect, well made and should give years of service.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CQRQPVMRZBSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014W1H1A4#wasThisHelpful","R3CQRQPVMRZBSW","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bestten 3-outlet Power Strip with three USB outlets received here as a manufacturer's sample functioned in all ways exactly as expected. The three 120 V outlets are, as the USB ports, switched. There are two 5 watt USB ports and one 2.4 12 watt port. The unit appears well made in all respects.No claims are made for suitability with Apple products so as a test we tried them here using an iPad G3 and iPad G5, an iPhone 6 and an iPhone 6+ all of which were charged without incident. In addition, we charged up a Samsung G5 phone and several Bluetooth headsets. Through all these tests, the Bestten functioned perfectly.Things would be perfect if all ports were 12 watt capable since the charger is 'smart' meaning it senses the attached device's ability to accept a charge. As things stand, the Bestten can only rapidly charge a single device, such as an iPad or a Galaxy, which can accept the full 2.5 A or 12 watts. A tablet takes a good long while to charge at 1 A or 5 watts.Still, it's quite convenient to have USB charging in the same device as one which turns one outlet into three. Overall, a nice device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q77F7FGGUK2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014POR8FG#wasThisHelpful","R3Q77F7FGGUK2Z","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Others likely will find this book more interesting or exciting or both. I didn't particularly enjoy it despite the fast pace due to several things. To start, it reads not as a standalone novel but a continuing chapter in a series. The author takes some trouble to explain that this or that person has had this or that conflict with another so they are still angry but that's no substitute for having read the previous (???) volumes.There is a great deal of danger but no tension at all. There is no doubt the stars will survive because they are part of a continuing story. So it was just ""let's get on with it watching you croak all the bad guys and be the heroes once more"" rather than wonder how it'll come out.There are some continuity issues. For example, at one point a character is hoping to be rescued by a spaceship she's current flying around on. Our adventurers take hours to reach a particular place but return in minutes. Two characters are caught in an almost fatal avalanche but then get up, dust  themselves off and without food or sleep, go into a few battles prevailing all the way.The tedious tropes are abounding. We have the captain who is, of course, a rogue. We have a crew who are all misfits but with amazing talents. They have a ship which is faster, more armored and more armed than anything anybody else has. We of course, have the pretty female who is so strong and great fighter than no man can stand up to her.Well paced simplistic shoot 'em up with little thinking demanded. If that's what you're seeking, you've found it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R140N7TPT3G3W3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155HBMOU#wasThisHelpful","R140N7TPT3G3W3","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To say that the Panasonic ER-GB60-K is a good trimmer is to put it mildly. It's terrifically adaptable for use on body, beard and head - at least male heads for the most part. The unique, to my knowing, aspect of this shaver is that it uses only two combs with a height adjuster from 1 to 20 to adjust the amount of hair left from .5 mm or 1/64"" to 20 mm or just short of an inch. This means, if you wish to have a beard in the latest fashion of looking like slight fuzz, the Panasonic will so that easily. The adjustability is in .5 mm or 1/64"" increments meaning this is the most precise trimmer / shaver I've ever encountered.  By far.Similarly, if you want to leave longer hair, almost up to an inch, this will accommodate you. Interestingly, in this age of specialization, the trimmer isn't contraindicated for anywhere on the body from bikini to face. So this will work well as a whole body trimmer but keep in mind that this isn't a shaver. The minimum hair left is .5 mm or 1/16th of an inch which may, to some, seem the same as a close shave but it's not. That much hair left on the face will be noticeable.The dry only handle is lightweight and remarkably comfortable due to its tapered in the middle shape. As an additional benefit, the manual has a little tutorial on barbering so the do it yourself audience which is the target market is better assured of getting a good result. The tutorial is long on facial hair but also includes how to give you a uniform head hair buzz cut or trim for a conventional haircut. My wife has been trimming the back of my neck for years now. We learned, to our surprise, she was doing it wrong. Trying the way in the Panasonic manual resulted in much better results in shorter time as well.I can't find a thing wrong or lacking in this trimmer and also can't think of anyway it can be improved. It's a really nice unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBLBB8F70DXC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3A1X0S#wasThisHelpful","RBLBB8F70DXC3","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The list of warnings about the use of the device and the contraindications of application are truly daunting. I wont attempt a comprehensive listing of all the warnings but besides not using if you have a suntan, the instructions warn against using if you menstruating, have any moles, warts, bruises or other injuries to the target areas, are diabetic or have a rash. Theres a good deal more too.In addition, the device as an epilator is contraindicated for use where many would like to use it such as the underarms, thighs, torso or face. The only areas suggested for use of the epilator head are the legs from the knees to the ankles and the arms from the elbows to the wrists except the softer posterior areas of the lower arm. Specific areas of forbidden use are the backs of knees, crooks of the arms, underarm and any area where your skin is less than perfectly tight which would eliminate older folks entirely as well as anybody whos recently lost weight.Areas such as the back or abdomen where men may wish to remove hair arent part of the suggested use areas. Same goes for the face where some women may wish to epilate. This leaves the epilating head as quite limited in utility. Many women wish to epilate their legs but is it common to do the same to your forearms? Id think it one of those rather rarely desired cosmetics, but maybe Im wrong.Taking my life in my own hands, I used the epilator head on tanned skin. The device did work well leaving itself covered in full length hair it had removed from the tried areas. It wasnt painful to use but not pleasant either. Afterwards I felt as if I had moderate sunburn for maybe 15 minutes and then it subsided. So the discomfort from use of this device in epilator mode was quite small. Overall the impression is closer to a bad razor burn which quickly goes away than anything else.The shaver head is useful in a variety of places the epilator isnt. It works as expected in all regards. This is the head you need to use in your bikini areas because the epilator is specifically forbidden to be used here. I would not try it either.In sum, this does work but the limited scope of recommended places the epilator can be used makes almost pointless. For most women, the only use will be the lower legs  assuming it can be used at all. Given this limited scope of application, my guess would be most would be better off with a conventional personal groomer many of which are made by Panasonic.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34FGY5UQ78IOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XN1PQIE#wasThisHelpful","R34FGY5UQ78IOI","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Productivity Software is an amalgam of crowd sourced recommendations taken from his Web site, Zen Market, of what the crowd thinks is the best app or Web site or other resource for a huge variety of needs. The idea that there are bests in all categories for everybody is ludicrous but the recommendations are still highly useful. In fact, the book is useful in a reverse manner from what its intended to do.The intention is, say, you want to find the best travel aggregators so you look up and find the two recommended (Kayak and Google Fights). However, if you dont know that aggregators exist, stumbling across this entry in the book may end up saving you major money on your next trip or finding a better flight or many other good things.I can quibble over some of the recommendations. One of my real gripes is the popularity of reddit and Yelp. Both are recommended, but at least the reddit misery is balanced by a Quora entry which is where you can really get your question answered civilly and intelligently. Yelp has been so corrupted by fake reviews that in many cases, its useless but that entry isnt balanced by the tightly moderated Tripadvisor where the ability to fake reviews is much reduced compared to Yelp.The lesson is that the books entries may have themselves been skewed by the same forces which have ruined some of the value of Yelp or reddit. Still, the book must have value for everybody or almost everybody. For example, did you know there is a home delivery service for dope? No, I didnt either and while Im not interested in the product, I was quite interested that its available for home delivery.Besides the recommendations, you get quotes from Jeff Bezos as well as a bit of a narrative at each section by the author.  Like the recommendations themselves, the book is a good resource and a thought provoker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38QUHSP2J84T5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VRRGO4#wasThisHelpful","R38QUHSP2J84T5","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Searcher is a ghost story, wrapped around a thriller and all encased in a fantasy. It involves, chiefly, a mysterious stranger who shows up apparently on a mission which cant be accomplished due to the apparent beneficiary being dead. The stranger is odd in appearance and has incredible powers and information he pulls out when needed but not hinted at before.The action involves a town with a foggy past, its founder, current town fathers and a whole raft of remarkably nasty drug lords who have amazing powers as well. In the case of the drug lords, the powers arent celestial but are at least as incredible as the mysterious strangers other earthly powers.The whole ride is enjoyable if more than a bit cruel. There is no questioning the writing skill of the author  its a pleasure to read. He, however, doesnt play fair in some ways. Any time we have a fantasy sort of book, or a sci fi or other books where current rules are suspended, we the readers are due knowing what the limits and bounds or the new rules are. If not, we get unsatisfactory scenes such as a central character who, when in peril, flies away like Superman. Fair only if we know he can fly before the peril descends.The narrative is exquisitely detailed. The action takes place within a day and fills the 500 pages easily. Again, here, the author doesnt play fair. We get pages of detail about how this or that character spends his or her time only for us to learn, when things get tight, that the one major detail which is critical about this time has been left out and that the detail offered is all meaningless static.Still, despite these issues, there is no denying that the major elements of a good novel exist here. The characters are well drawn, even if we dont get a good idea what the mysterious stranger is although there is some clarification in an epilogue.  Anybody who isnt a psychopath will hate the bad guys, although one is mysteriously given a pass at the end, and also wish the good guys well. Again, who is good and bad tend to shift around a bit and when all the chips fall, many are, at best, ambiguous.The Searcher is clearly a well done genre busting novel. I only wish itd have played a bit fairer with the reader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B8ERIRW75GUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062329723#wasThisHelpful","R3B8ERIRW75GUU","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is, with one limitation, a perfect solution to the need to create a Y for garden sorts of hoses. The manufacturer's sample received here is well made. The valves needed to be 'unstuck' with  a bit of effort initially but after the first move, work smoothly and easily. They seal completely. The fit and finish is ideal throughout.The only issue which may not be for many, is that the outlet side has only a 1 cm diameter (approximately) or .4"" The inlet side is a full 2 cm (approximately) meaning it'll flow without restriction the common 5/8"" or 3/4"" garden hose. However, if you close one side of the Y you cut down the effective size of the fluid path to half of the diameter of the hose.So if you have both sides of the Y flowing, there is no or negligible loss of total flow but if you were to close one side, the resulting flow would be less than if there were no Y fitting in the fluid path. The upshot is that this design is perfect if both sides of the Y are open but not ideal if only one side were open.If you need a Y and the single sided bore constriction isn't a major factor for you, then this is an ideal solution to that need.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB5K3UA6RQMAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144B77O2#wasThisHelpful","RB5K3UA6RQMAP","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The manufacturer's sample received here is beautifully made. The stock is very heavy and the finish polished to a thick lustrous shine. The handles are cover with a thick silicone making them comfortable and easy to grip.However, the silicone coating is also an issue. The two concave sections of the juicer don't come completely together but are held apart by this coating when you have the juicer fully closed. This means there is juice left in the fruit after the juicer is as compressed at it can be made to close.Both my wife and I had no problems taking a fully mashed lemon from the juicer and, using our fingers, get a good deal more juice from the fruit. This issue could have been easily resolved by making the top concave section just a few mm deeper.Still, even with this issue, this juicer would be of great utility to older people or those with arthritis or other issues causing a grip limitations.

"The manufacture's sample received here was a bit of a surprise. Unlike most bud type ear phones, these feel like they're carved from billet steel giving them a high quality sense when held or used. The bass is significantly superior to competing products I've used. My wife, a musician, agrees. The noise cancellation is reasonably effective but clearly cannot match a quality over the ear headphone. Still, some is better than none.They come in a nice case. The cord is very flexible making them both comfortable in use and also this means the cord puts less stress on the buds which lessens the tendency of them to pull out of the ear.So far all's to the good but there are some aspects which are, if not bad, at least areas of possible improvement.The buds are marked 'Right' and 'Left' in a small non-contrasting italic font which is difficult to see in lower light or by those who have less then prefect close vision. This could be reduced by using a large 'R' and 'L' instead of the whole word. The issue could be eliminated by color coding the buds or using a one/two bump to identify right and left by feel.Also these lack the over the ear hooks of buds marketed for athletic pursuits. While these do retain well for normal buds they would be retained that much better and in more situations by the addition of these inexpensive over the ear hooks. I remain utterly baffled by ear buds lacking those retaining hooks. Seems like a no brainer to have them in all such products.Still for what they are, they are great. After all, sound and convenience is what ear buds are all about here and the Audiosharp AS1217's are superior in both areas.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E9DP3XE09VX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8YV9L0#wasThisHelpful","R3E9DP3XE09VX9","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are ties with an option Ive never seen before. The manufacturers samples received here have releases which make them reusable. The reuse trigger is a swiveling pawl which engages ratcheting teeth. Other than the swivel, this mechanism is identical to other ties.However, unique in my experience to these ties, an easy flick of the pawl swivels it out of engagement releasing the tie for reuse. Being nylon, these ties would work for dozens of reuses too. Now most folks, after using a tie, snip it to remove the long tail left after snugging. Needless to say, if you snip, you also make the tie a good deal less suited for reuse. Then again, the release can still be useful because it means you can remove the tie instantly without tools  a major advantage over ties demanding a tool for removal.I cant see how this release would undo the tie by accident either. Still, Id not use them in critical environments such as aircraft or marine where a released tie may cause mayhem. I saw no way to safe the release.These ties are definitely an improvement over common ties for most applications and a major improvement if you want to use these for a temporary hold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGANWL4AUC6UK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EKL7LS#wasThisHelpful","RGANWL4AUC6UK","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These washcloths are exactly as advertised in all respects. They are astonishingly soft but also just as absorbent as any other terry sort of cloth.At first blush, it seems almost magic that a woody grass can be made into something this soft. The secret is modern chemistry where the fibers of the bamboo are made to yield rayon which is then woven into this cloth. Yes, rayon, which sounds as if itd be made from oil is really a plant product and has always been just that.For those concerned with green issues, of course bamboo is less an environmental load than growing, say, cotton. However, there are downstream issues of processing. Bamboo can be processed into rayon using either open or closed systems which have differing impacts. The manufacturers sample received here didnt discuss which of these broad category processes these washcloths use.These would be by far the best washcloths to use for babies due to them being so soft. If you prefer a rougher cloth for washing, then these work less well. Two adults slightly disagreed on these. One prefers the softness and one would prefer a bit of a loofa feel to washcloths.If you have a baby or care for one, run; dont walk, to get a set of these.

"This was, for me, a remarkably enjoyable book. Here are my reasons:-The good guys are immediately and consistently likable. There is no hesitation in wishing them well.-The bad guys or who may be the bad guys are more that one faction and we're not sure even up to the end of the book if they are bad guys, good guys or neutral. In the end, the bad guy is revealed but my guess is that some readers will feel the so called bad guy had a few good points and maybe wasn't so bad after all.-The pacing is consistent neither going into frantic chase mode or long sags of explanation.-The science is great. The author, in a long end note, explains what elements of the science are real, what aren't and what may be.-And best of all, all people behave intelligently throughout. There are no stupid moves which are inserted to get the author out of a tight spot. Both the good and bad / maybe bad guys act thoughtfully throughout. Sometimes the bad guys win but sometimes the good guys win too. The book is fantastic but felt like real life-The book's thoughtfulness on time travel blows every other time travel book out of the water. The author has thought of issues I've never seen before and I have to conclude he's got the right of it. What good would being able to travel a tiny split second back into the past do you? Well, it'd have more impact than the invention of fire to us. No, I won't do a spoiler.-The ex Ranger hero isn't a superman who can enter a room full of angry tigers, wrestle then and prevail even after 72 hours of no sleep or food. Instead he's a human.Terrifically plotted, well paced and thoughtful. Not much to ask for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37KARLI2FLXCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014TE4FUS#wasThisHelpful","R37KARLI2FLXCP","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im going to admit to a great reviewer sin: I didnt finish this book. Let me explain why and why I have two starred it as well. I stuck it out for well over 100 pages, but lifes too short.The apparent protagonist (one isnt sure) has a major unexplained history with many other characters and at least one shadowy institution. However, none is explained which lead me to enormous frustration wondering what hes doing / thinking and why because going by the information given, hes acting insanely. Its as if this isnt a novel but instead part two or for all I know, part fifty two of a story where I came in toward the middle or maybe the end but surely not the beginning.Other people too behave in unrealistic manners. The opening scene is not only bizarre, but utterly incomprehensible and makes no sense internally even accepting the little information were given within that scene. Later in the book, the probable protagonist, a policeman I think, is given tens of thousands of files to digitize via a scanner.  For no given reason, he opens one file, gets obsessed with it and abandons his work as a digitizer and instead starts chasing his tail all over the LA basin trying to solve this cold case.What may be an interesting area of the book is fatally damaged by again making no sense. It concerns a family of Jewish Czechs who have immigrated into the US. No time frame is given other than it must be post WWII because there is talk of the camps. So this family, lost in the temporal drift of a poorly constructed novel, bicker over nothing comprehensible. The chief dispute is over the 17 year old daughter (17 years 11 months, were told) wishing to take a pottery class but wants to keep it a secret not only from her parents, but from her friend who covers for her.I heard of secrecy but being secretive even from your own best friend about a silly pottery class? Yes, she then meets up with some traditional Jews who teach her some ceremonies her parents either never did or abandoned but the secrecy was due to clay initially. If she wont discuss a pottery class, what will she discuss?The writing style is inconsistent. One voice uses the enormously annoying present tense for past actions  a recent unfortunate trend. So we get sentences like (not in the book but made up by me to give you an idea): Long ago, Bobby walks into the room. He sees Ethel. He knows immediately that Ethel is. The other voice uses the predicate for past actions and its like a breath of fresh air, really. Then we get back to the muddled tense voice.OK, I repeat here: nothing makes any sense likely because the roots of events are in the previous volumes or something. So we seem to have what may be a major player who is a ghost or a something able to fly around, observe events, have an effect on events and even materialize into a human form to seduce males. Is this the golem? Is this a succubus? A ghost? An imaginary being? I have no idea nor do I have any idea if this being has any limits or if its omniscient and omnipotent. There are hints that this whatever and what I take to be the digitizing policeman have had a major relationship in the past but gee, who can be sure what happened in volume 34 of this set?I confess to being a simple minded reader. I dont wish to go hundreds of pages holding unrelated players and events in my head hoping that by page 450 the authors will pull it all together for me. Even at 17 I knew my life was too short to waste it reading the assigned Ulysses so I requested an alternate. When asked by my teacher why I didnt want to read it, I said I had no patience for pretentious garbage masquerading as literature. He laughed and assigned me an alternative.Ill grant this isnt pretentious, but its not for me. My life was too short to waste wading through nonsense at 17 and my life left to live is even less today. So for these reasons, and many others I wont go into because by now I've either made my point with you or I can't, I am out.Paul looks around his office and decides hell put a 30 at the end of the review hes writing.30.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSV3MRNIAXG6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399171738#wasThisHelpful","RSV3MRNIAXG6L","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ammex nitrile glove reviewed here fits a bit small. I usually take an X-L or an XX-L and while these did fit, they didnt slide on but were quite tight but not uncomfortable. I use gloves for doing work on the cars and bikes where the task, such as removing and replacing a drive chain on a bike (motorcycle) can leave very difficult to remove oily dirt on ones hands.Previously I used latex gloves I got from a medical supply source. Those latex ones are not surgery gloves by any means but more for examining or doing lite biohazard work such as bedpan duty. The problem I had with these are that they tended to rip very easily putting me in the awkward situation of having to either stop work and re-glove or live with the knowing that I was getting greasy hands.I hoped the nitrile gloves would be more robust or in other words, less prone to ripping while still being easy on and off. I wasnt disappointed. I did a major cleaning and lubrication of two motorcycle drive chains while wearing a set of the Ammex gloves.  Neither glove ripped. The gloves are thin enough that they dont hinder fine motor skills as well.To my surprise, they came off easily too without me needing to turn them inside out as I always have to with the latex gloves. This gave me an idea. I put them back on and used a heavy duty mechanics hand cleaner to wash the gloves just as if I was washing my hands. They came clean easier than real hands would due to their smooth surface. I took them off, dried them and now theyre ready for re-use. Beats me how many uses theyll take but so far so good.Clearly a step up from the conventional latex gloves. Im sold. They work just as advertised with no surprises good or bad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MF45RN29QEMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E21HDK#wasThisHelpful","R1MF45RN29QEMJ","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By far the most useful part of the Etekcity Square One is the tape but the other parts are useful too. This puts this device solidly in the why not category.  By that I mean if youre going to get a measuring tape, why spend money on just a tape when you can get a multitool for about the same cost. To top it off, the tape part is superior to most tapes.By superior, the tape is in inches and centimeters. The manufacturers sample provided me has a feature Ive never seen before in any tape although others must have it. The inch side of the tape has more than hash marks between the marked inches. It also has fractions in eighths marked at the appropriate hash mark. This means when youre looking at measurement between the whole inches, you can see in a flash the eighths rather than count up or down from the half or whole measures to see if the exact measure easily.OK, I never had any significant issues seeing the exact measurement but this does make that task just that much easier and less prone to error. Now that I see Etekcity has it, I have to wonder why the other half dozen tapes we have accumulated around here dont.The other tools will have varying utility. For us, the straight edge and pencil holder and  sharpener have good utility while the protractor is something we cant figure how wed use. Still, no harm having it along for the ride. The belt clip holds the device well. In use, its no more obtrusive when clipped to the belt than a standard measuring tape.To me, this is clearly the way to go if you are in the market for a tape or wish to give one for a gift. Its a better than usual tape included in a multitool and all for the price of a typical tape alone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TDOBPK9GS917/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014S6EVU6#wasThisHelpful","R3TDOBPK9GS917","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That there is demand for a product such as the Mobiilink Quick Charger six port charger says a good deal about our society. That the two of us can almost fill two of these Mobiilink Chargers with devices says quite a bit about us.However, that's a different discussion. As it turns out, we do have more devices than outlets or at least outlets in convenient places to act as charging stations. The Mobiilink charger is a compact 60 watt device meaning it can devote a full 10 watts per USB port which is whats needed to charge up the larger devices such as tablets. It also means it can charge small devices such as phones that much quicker.We loaded up the sample supplied by the manufacturer with a variety of mostly discharged devices including two iPads (G3 and G5) an iPhone 6, an iPhone 6+, a Bluetooth headset and a Samsung Galaxy 5 as a stress test. We do not have a device meeting the Qualcomm fast charge standard to test. The Mobiilink had no issues charging all the devices up and we felt the charge time was the same as if we had we each device on its own dedicated 10 watt solo charger.The plug which goes into the 120 v outlet is a standard plug rather than having a lump at its outlet end so it take up a minimum real estate at that end.Overall, I can report the operation perfect and the design thoughtful and well-functioning. Its decreased the amount of clutter we had around the outlets formerly dedicated to an ad hoc charging station. All the combinations of devices and charge / data cables worked perfectly. We could not induce any errors or issues of any sort and we tried.Little devices such as this are hardly mandatory for life, but they also decrease the little annoyances we each face every day and as such, the Mobiilink has earned a valued  place in our household.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K125KBR7E6D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01184JGYC#wasThisHelpful","R1K125KBR7E6D4","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There aren't many advantages to glass cooking or storage over other materials, but those few advantages may be so important to some that the disadvantages aren't important.The main advantage is that glass is utterly non-reactive. It seems that daily we're bombarded with statements a typical citizen can't evaluate about the dangers of this or that metal or this or that plastic. This plastic causes cancer. That metal makes you senile. It goes on and on. Few materials, if more than one, are never accused of these sorts of issues that one always good material is glass.Also to some, glass looks good. It does too until you let it get a bit grungy and then it looks, well, less than good.The downsides of glass exist too. It's heavy. It can break although the Pyrex brand tempered glass is surprisingly strong, it isn't nearly as strong as, say, steel. It doesn't conduct heat well. It can't be used on the stove top either. So you need to decide for yourself if the advantages outweigh the obvious disadvantages.This set is well made with covers that fit securely. The glass is dishwasher safe while the covers are top shelf dishwasher only. The set is advertised for cooking, microwaving and storage but the blub does say the glass is preheated oven save rather than the glass with a cover. The covers are microwave ok (tried extensively here) but do not have valves to release expanding gasses as the nuke process marches on. This is an issue for `waving, in my view. If you plan on regularly using these to microwave food, I suggest you choose the set with the valves in the cover.  We leave a bit of the cover cracked which so far has worked ok.If you're looking for a glass set of cooking and or storage containers, this is definitely one to consider. We've cooked, `waved and stored many things using this set and found no issues other than the lack of a release valve in the covers for microwaving. Works as expected with nothing surprising either good or bad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WEPVS2R9DKQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119IGNB6#wasThisHelpful","R1WEPVS2R9DKQ7","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"`Saving Sophie' is an instantly engrossing novel involving many factions. Some are the unambiguous good guys, some the clearly bad guys but many who are either in between or who will change your mind as the story unfolds and we get to see that what appears like one thing at first blush really isn't that but something else.The pacing is, for the most part, brisk. There is a good deal going on which means a fairly long novel, but there's no filler. All the events either move the plot forward, get us to know the players a bit more or, to an unusual extent, give up background history on about the Israel / Palestine area and dispute. Those who are in the camp that all Muslims are evil and should be exterminated will be annoyed to find many who are just trying to live their lives in peace and prosperity.  Not to despair  - there's some major Arab baddies in there too.A good deal of the plot is clever. I especially enjoyed how one set of criminals use the police to accomplish the criminal's ends. The other side is that much of what must occur stretched my credulity to the breaking point. There are several sets of bad guys and one of the questions is if they are linked and if so how and why. One set seems to behave like the Three Stooges one time and beyond Godfather clever the next. This inconsistency bothered me a bit.Also at one point, two people just sort of run into each other in a major eye roller of coincidence and then there are the international three letter agencies relying on a bunch of civilians to pull off a major operation in an area the civilians have no familiarity with. Finally, a man is gravely injured so much that the docs want to keep him sedated for another week, but he's awakened, takes a bruising long trip and then, when needed, he sprints into physical action. It's just silly, really.Still, an exciting well-paced story where you'll want the good guys to win (well, unless you are a sociopath), the bad guys to lose and the loose ends all tied up. You won't be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFOFA0BTN8C19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250065852#wasThisHelpful","RFOFA0BTN8C19","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We'd never tried an LED bulb before for household use so when offered a manufacturer's sample, I eagerly accepted.The Madking A19 has a conventional base and doesn't seem to demand any special handling or treatment in any way. Screw it in and turn it on just like any old Edison. In use, the light is quite warm. I estimate it as being 3,200k which puts it toward the romantic side of the spectrum. People look great in this temperature lighting. It's not ideal for reading but not bad either.Put in the old watt output standard, I'd guess the output is just a bit less than what you'd expect from a 60 watt bulb. In other words, it's ideal for most household and business uses. Of course, the huge advantage of this is you get almost 60 watts of light for 1/10 the cost in electricity. Also the LED nature of this bulb promises long life.In the recent past, these LED bulbs were so expensive that even long life and less electricity usage couldn't justify their cost but that's not the case with the newer generation LED's such as the Madking A19. Also unlike the other economical bulb, the florescent, there is no issue of hazardous gas inside.We're sold on these and will be replacing our conventional filament and florescent bulbs with Madkings as those burn out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUN6UMXPHXPIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R95WXHW#wasThisHelpful","RUN6UMXPHXPIO","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product went from high expectations while in the box to a  bit of disappointment in use.The good parts:1. The HA100 looks good. It's quite small - roughly 2 1/2"" x 2 1/4"" across and only maybe 3/4"" thick. The fit and finish are excellent showing a combination of the shiny high tech black common and a nice brushed finish for the top.2. Operation is flawless. It showed up on several tested iPhones and iPads and paired quickly and easily. There was no issue getting a good signal to several output devices using both the 3.5 mm and RCA plugs (both supplied).The not so good parts:1. It has no internal battery. The factory supplied way to power it is to use the supplied 120 v power cord so you're tied to needing a outlet to use the HA100.2. The power cord has, at its plug end, one of those incredibly annoying huge transformers which hog up a great deal of space at the outlet or power strip. This hog of a transformer is oriented ideally for a power strip and is thinner than others. Still, I'm sick and tired of this trend of having a huge block at the plug end of a power cord. I have some power strips where I lose half the outlets due to these transformers blocking more than their share of real estate. In this case, the HA100's transformer isn't a worse case than others but it's still something I want to never have to contend with again. Good luck with that.To be fair to the HA100, it does say for home stereo use and home stereos do demand power so this limitation is, perhaps, asking it to do things that it wasn't advertised to do. If you have a matching 12 v power supply such as available here at Amazon, you could also use it in your car, but it'd mean a rather complex mass of cabling, but it should work (not tested).Still, there are many portable devices which have 3.5mm or RCA inputs and it'd have been quite nice to have the HA100 provide the Bluetooth / NFC link to these devices but alas, it's not to be. Also that *#&*#& enormous transformer at the plug end of the power cord. I'm so tired of this that I almost want to remove a star due to that, but I won't.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EOA5O7VH1LUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPATOEE#wasThisHelpful","R3EOA5O7VH1LUL","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The manufacturer's sample received here is a well made high quality cable with one unique feature or if not unique, I've never seen it before. Rather than being round in cross section, the cable is a ribbon. So what, you say. The rationale is that this makes it much easier and more stable to loop up for transport or storage.This doesn't seem like that much of a feature because even the round cross sectioned cables can be looped. I'll agree that this isn't some sort of thundering breakthrough idea which will make all existing MFI cables obsolete but it makes it just a wee bit better than others and in doing so, it loses nothing.So award four stars for a very well made MFI certified cable and add one for the ribbon style cable replacing the more mundane hose shaped one. Interesting color too.

"This smartphone car holder, supplied as a sample by the manufacturer, works well with some limitations which mostly depend on the target car's design. The holder uses a spring loaded hook to attach to a vent but most of the mass of the phone / holder is taken by the two legs which rest on the dash. This puts little stress on the vent itself. The downside of this arrangement is that if you hit hard bumps in the road, the holder is free to move vertically which can impede your ability to read or use the smartphone.We tested with an iPhone 6 in and out of the case. No matter how rough the road, the phone was well retained in the holder somewhat to my surprise because there is no bottom prongs to support the phone. Still, it worked perfectly in this respect.Consider, though, that adding a holder and a phone to a vent will block some car functions at least on the models we tried this holder on. Also the holder / phone combo at least somewhat blocked the vent making it a bit less effective than without the holder attached.So how well this will work for you depends on your car's layout, its controls and if you can reduce a vent's effectiveness to some degree. Like all things, this is a compromise which will work very well for some and less well for others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDFDOOYBSO84H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012SUGNSC#wasThisHelpful","RDFDOOYBSO84H","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This, a manufacturer supplied sample, is the third Bluetooth headphone of roughly the same design from three different manufacturers I've tried. By far, this is the best. No contest really. Here's the summary rundown:1. The sound is crystal clear. Using these headphones and watching some commercial videos, I heard little details like city background noise which wasn't audible using my alternative headphones a set of Bluetooth over the ear phones retailing for $100.00. They work equally well for voice or music. They lack the deep presence of an expensive over the ear phone but what else would you expect?2. Battery life is superb. The Bluetooth battery meters on the devices I connected to showed, after 2.25 hours of use no decrease in battery capacity which implies to me that these phones aren't reporting to the device. Still, the headphones were going strong after that time indicating very long battery life for such a small device. This crushes the competing headphones I've tried neither of which made a full hour of battery.3. Retention on ear is solid. The connecting cord is a spring which holds the phones to your head during activity. In addition, the way the phones fit is the over the hear method which affords even greater safety and retention.4. Controls. Due to the small size of these phones, the controls are likewise small and for me, somewhat difficult to locate and use. I do have `gorilla hands' and those with normally sized hands likely will have no difficulty. Even so, I was able, with some fiddling, to use the controls if not easily. Still, I blame this more on my anatomy than a defect of phone design.Overall, I'm thrilled with these headphones and feel they merit the full five stars awarded.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AVNXRZ7SEY2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012XS63UM#wasThisHelpful","R1AVNXRZ7SEY2X","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first sample sent by SimpliFine had a manufacturing defect. I wrote a middling review due to this loss of function. The company sent a replacement mandoline which we've used extensively for a few days now. The results are much more favorable than the initial sample.We tried this with a variety of foods finding the function to be as expected or better in all respects. Specifically, the main slicing blade and machine worked as expected. In both the initial and this sample, the julienne operation was better than expected.The mandoline comes complete with several spacers to vary the slice sizes in the main slicing operation as well as two julienne inserts to make fine or coarse (French fries) strips. It even includes a holder for the accessories which looks and acts like a knife block made of plastic to match the mandoline.The only slight operational issue we had was when we went into high production. The angle of the device means it's comfortable to use but it also means a buildup of sliced food at the lowered end of the device meaning you need to, from time to time, break your rhythm to spread the buildup. This is a very small quibble and it's offset by the kickstand supported slant which means its comfortable to use even over long periods.If you care about presentation in you cooking, a mandoline is almost a required accessory to your kitchen. Very few people possess the knife skill to create the same uniform slicing or julienne results that a mandoline will yield. Those who do have these skills likely dont want to spend the time to get the same results as a few seconds using a machine such as this SimpliFine yields. It makes a nice gift too but be sure to use safety gloves. This is a serious tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2814A0LS5O0DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010B0YS5G#wasThisHelpful","R2814A0LS5O0DG","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't remember getting any product which so often surprised me in a delightful way as this Asus Chromebook. I never used a Chromebook before and had only a vague notion of what one was. As it turns out, I underestimated this laptop's capacity in a huge way. I'll hit a few of the high points below.The screen is superb. I rate it significantly better than my iPad Air's highly touted retina screen. The spec sheet may have the retina at a higher resolution but the contrast and saturation of the Asus crushes the Apple product making it better for any task from reading, to working, to watching videos. No contest.Touch screen: works well. Not quite up to iPad standards in the sense of multi-finger gestures, but not badly dinged by this lack. The screen is responsive and a worthy addition to a laptop.Keyboard: The keyboard is about the same size as the standard Mac keyboard. To me, that means it's meant for pixies but most, including my Mac using wife, find it perfect. My huge ape-like hands have an issue with it as they do with any Mac. I'd guess 90% of the population will have no issue.Printing: Chromebooks have a bad rap here and I agree that not having WiFi printing a serious omission. However, I had a ChromeOS ready Epson already needing only a firmware upgrade. Doing this upgrade and then setting up Google Print was a snap. So if you have ready hardware - it's easy peasy. If you don't,  grrrr.Flexibility: here's where the Chromebooks shine. As you likely know, you can run Google Office off or online storing files in the Cloud or locally. I went from cloud skeptical to storing my important files there to forget about backups failing or viruses lurking. What surprised me was how easy it was to set up remote desktop on both our Windows PC and a Mac. So we can run Google Office (Open Office), any Windows program, any Mac program and all storing files locally or in various clouds. Setting all this up was quick, easy and went without a hitch. I need to use Microsoft Access and doing so from this Chromebook is perfectly easy and transparent.  I also `cast many Internet feeds to my 55"" LG HD TV making for no regrets about being a cable cutter.If all of this isn't enough, and it wasn't for me because I was intrigued by all this machine can do, you can flip into Developer Mode, access the Linux which underpins the ChromeOS and install another Linux shell such as Ubuntu and then run Linux programs. There is also a wrapper you can get to run, one at a time, most if not all Android apps available from the play.google.com site.  Google has been working on a way to run all Android apps under ChromeOS. By the time you read this review, it may have that accomplished.After a month using this machine daily, my only remaining question is why anybody would choose a limited laptop such as a Windows or Mac OS machine. Me? I'm sold on Chromebook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TTJTAND1CCSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3X678#wasThisHelpful","R3TTJTAND1CCSV","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a product once only found in pro kitchens. I was a bit skeptical about the claims that it could replace parchment, wax, oil, grease and cooking spray (in many situations). I've been using the sample furnished by the company for a while now and have grudgingly come over to believe the claims made for this mat.The company furnishes, free of charge, a small intro to this mat along with a few simple recipes. You'll get it at your Amazon email address a few days after buying the mat from Amazon. I tried one recipe to start. I felt a bit odd about placing food directly onto what to me felt like a soft plastic mat and then baking away but it turned out just fine. I think the biggest issue I had was my own skepticism. I was definitely expecting some outgassing from the product when new so I baked it at 350F for 15 minutes all alone in the oven to see how much outgassing would occur. None did then or in any other chore.I now find myself using this all the time for a variety of things from kneading bread (better than on the kitchen counter), baking cookies or using it as a non stick liner in place of aluminum foil. For the latter, I just did my super hot to mild oven roast recipe which starts the meat out at 425 F and then reduces it to 315 for the duration of the cooking time. I lined a cookie sheet with the SimpliFine mat and used a variety of marinades and coatings on the meat sure to leave a gooey, sugary sticky mess on the mat when done.In the past, I've lined the cookie sheet with aluminum foil because not to do so would make for a fierce clean up chore. To my surprise the mess came off the mat with very little effort. The mat was unaffected by the high initial heat as well.Overall, I was and remain delightfully surprised at how useful this mat is. I can't think of any way to improve it so the five stars. Try it. You'll like it as they say.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FH50DJ24EPC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UL1D9TC#wasThisHelpful","R2FH50DJ24EPC9","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This holder fits into the CD slot and then a few twists of the large thumb wheel secures it in place. The phone mounts to the padded holder which will secure it against anything short of a high speed crash. In use, the holder vibrates a bit when you hit bumps but not to the point of being scary. The vibrations damp down quickly so you never lose the use of the phone for more than a second or two assuming you aren't on a road that's all bumps.The holder has two prongs at the bottom which secure the base of the phone. On the iPhone 6, the prongs clear the ports for charging and the 3.5mm phone plug. The relief may demand you insert the charge cord and/or the audio plug before mounting but once inserted, the holder doesn't interfere with the cords in any way.Tested with an iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+ both in and out of their cases. All tests showed perfect operation. Overall I can't see any defects or possible improvements in materials, workmanship or design so the five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22GX3FLKPJ5JL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012C50YME#wasThisHelpful","R22GX3FLKPJ5JL","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everything in this kit works as advertised However, I'm skeptical that it offers any cleaning improvement over a standard bucket and sponge mop. Let me explain why I say this.The idea of two bucket chambers, one for clean and one for dirty water makes sense to those who don't fully grasp the concept of surfactants in detergents. Even so, clearly clean water to clean is a better solution (ha ha) than using the same water over and over until you are `cleaning' the floor with dirty gray-brown water.Here, there are two chambers as the manufacturer states. You put detergent water mix in one chamber. Press on the mop handle and the head spins picking up a huge amount of water. I'd guess it holds a full quart / liter of liquid. Clearly you don't want to flood your floor with this so put it in the spin / dirty water basket, press the handle a few times to spin it and you spin out clean water into the dirty water chamber but at least get the mop ready to mop. This is, in my mind, inferior to the old rollers where the clean water is returned to the clean water side of the bucket.OK, now mop. Then put the now very dirty mop into the dirty basket, spin, wring out the dirty water and then put in the clean water repeating the cycle. This both wastes some good detergent water and also doesn't fully clean the mop. The fibers are dirty from the mopping no matter how much spinning I did so I ended up polluting the clean water anyway just like a regular non spinning mop kit would.Did it clean the floor? Yes, just fine. Did it spin and work as advertised? Clearly it did. It did, while spinning with a saturated clean water mop head spray a bit on my legs due to that super saturation, but mopping isn't a sterile pastime so I'll let that go.  In the end are my floors cleaner than with a sponge mop / single bucket? I don't think so. The gadgets guy in me enjoyed the heck out of the spinning and the idea of two chambers but I can't see it helped in cleaning in any way. It may have, but I can't see it.One other thing, I think those with weak hands will have trouble inserting the clean out plug so it doesn't leak (it needs to be FIRMLY) and if it were in well, getting it back out. This area needs a valve, not a plug. Overall a nice idea which is fun to play with but which doesn't seem to contribute much to cleanliness.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL5FY6GQZZW06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0KU2V8#wasThisHelpful","RL5FY6GQZZW06","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, to be fair, I did get a great deal of information from this book. I was a new Chromebook user and now have a good working knowing of the system partly due to reading this book. However, it could have been a good deal better than it was.The world of Chrome is moving fast and this book is a bit past its sell by date. There is little the author can do about the published book on this account but for doing this sort of writing, a Web site which updates the book's information would be nice. Even other areas, such as Windows, seems dated. The author is utterly hung up on Windows 8 and cannot say 'Windows' without appending the 8 even though 8.1 has been around for a long time now and 10 is the current version (as of this review).The irony of the author dating his book with Windows 8 mentions is that the information is not exclusive to Windows 8 but applies at least to all Windows from Vista to 10. Worse, the book fails to even mention that Macs exist. The book goes into how to run Remote Desktop from Windows so you can use Windows programs on your Chromebook but you can do the identical in a Mac which he fails to mention. We're running both here without a glitch.There are a few technical errors as well. For example, to install Crouton, he skips that you need to enter the command 'shell' after you shell out of the GUI into the crosh shell. Not doing so will result in baffling errors for the newcomer.I'd say you get your money's worth in this book but it could have been more. I'd like to see it refreshed, a bit better organized (put all the Windows / MSFT stuff in one place instead of polluting up the whole book) and have the author ask a friend to do a tech edit.Still, like I said, you get your money's worth here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXYKYL8SVBR05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3V14C6#wasThisHelpful","RXYKYL8SVBR05","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a set of two brushes both of which are very aggressive. Added is a water reservoir in the handle. Fill the handle with water and then turn the valve on while scrubbing your pre-heated grill and you'll get some steam. It's not like a steam cleaning of a grill, but rather water dripping on hot grates makes some steam while the brushes do all the real work.The upshot is one very clean grill but the steam did nothing I could see to assist this. I tried this on two grungy grills. One I used the water drip and one with no water. Both results were quite good but that begs the question what does the water do? I can't see any benefit to having this.I'll use this to clean my grills because I've never used a tool which gives better results than the 'scraper' brush and the regular brush, but I probably won't bother with filling the handle with water again.There is a very small and difficult (for my large hands) wing nut which detaches the brushes from the handle for easy machine washing. Well, it'd be an easy detachment for my wife's piano player sort of long slim fingers but I had a bit of a tussle.One caution if you get this. Be careful taking it out of the box. These brushes are seriously sharp and aggressive. The instructions warn you of this but of course, you can't see the instructions until you unpack the unit. For those of you in the southwest, think cholla cactus.A good set of brushes but I can't see the steam business adding any benefit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BBGQJHAKPZQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVL6UAG#wasThisHelpful","R1BBGQJHAKPZQ8","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By now, book 5, unless you've started with this from an earlier edition, you'd probably be a bit lost. So I'm writing this for those who have read 5/5.I think we're getting into a pattern which needs a bit more variation. McGill's luck, the constant treachery of the Galina and Claver, the stupid constant noise from Ortiz and the rotating girlfriends who don't grow in number but don't shrink either is getting to be repetitive.Here we do have a bit of a variation in the sense that the group rushes into engage an unknown enemy without even the slightest scouting. Really? Nobody is that stupid as to invade a planet with an enemy of unknown abilities and then to not even secure the ship not once but twice and once after an attack. An enemy drills in from outside the hull and the captain, after the battle doesn't check the hull for more invaders?These two elements harmed the book for me. They seemed stupid beyond belief and also stupid out of character for the people we'd gotten to know. Then, to go to a supposed peace conference with the intent of killing the other party under a truce flag - poor form. Well, it does work out of course and the last scene sets us up for book 6 which I definitely will buy and soon after publication.I do hope for a bit of an improvement, though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NSLNLXZ6R8IJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VC05XU4#wasThisHelpful","R3NSLNLXZ6R8IJ","A1K5KHJRKINCP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K5KHJRKINCP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that pillow cases are not offered separately.  I have a queen bed, but use king pillows.  The standard size pillow cases that come with the set are useless to me so I am stuck with pillow cases that do not match my sheets.

This book is a great, timeless teaching tool that provides an easy bonding time for the child and the person who reads to her.

"Two of my rose bushes become infected with rust each year.  And for the first time, this year I had scale on a crabapple tree. In the past I would have controlled both of these conditions with Neem Oil.  However Neem Oil has such a strong odor that it leaves me feeling sick after Ive sprayed.  The Ortho Tree & Shrub Fruit Tree Spray seems to work just as well, and the Neem Oil is cut just enough (by 30%) that the odor is far less obnoxious.  It mixes readily, is highly effective, and is in an easy-to-open container.  I really like that it does not trigger my asthma and I do not smell it for hours afterward - which has been my problem with Neem Oil.  The disadvantage, of course, is that it is not a natural product and it does contain insecticides.  So one must be very careful where and when to spray.  I waited to spray my crabapple until after the flowers had dropped, and I remove the flowers from the rose bushes before spraying  even then I spray very early in the morning before the honeybees come into my yard. I highly recommend this spray, but only for targeted use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R39GWNP7999O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTDGGD2#wasThisHelpful","R3R39GWNP7999O","AO96PLO6E3MJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO96PLO6E3MJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ive been using various Miracle-Gro products for many years and they have never let me down.  The Shake N Feed line is the easiest to use  for established plants, just sprinkle it on top of the soil following the directions for proper amounts, and every time the granules get wet, the Miracle-Gro dissolves a little more and sends nutrients down to the roots.  Every couple of months, shake out a little more around the root-line of the plants.  The All-Purpose product works well for potted as well as ground plants.  With new plantings, I mix Miracle-Gro deep into the potting soil to give the plants a good start.  At first I was unsure but, once I got used to it, I found the newly designed shaker top is easier to manipulate than the old spout design.  With the spout, I sometimes poured more plant food than I intended.  I store my gardening supplies in an outside potting area, so I like that the granules of this particular food continue to be available in a water-proof container.  This ensures the bottom never gets soggy and turns the plant food into a block of unusable stuff.

"I have one of these automatic sprayers in a closet that houses a stinky lockbox (I think it was shipped in a container that was filled with fish by-products.)  This little sprayer does a great job keeping the closet smelling fresh and the fishy odor just disappears.  The other sprayer is kept in the small room in our master bath that has no windows and houses the toilet.  It is easy to keep the little room smelling fresh and clean using the automatic sprayer.  My only complaint about this product is that the spray itself is noisy.  It is possible to hear it go off from another room when the house is quiet.

"I received a bottle of Dr. Kings Sinus Relief for review through the Vine program and was surprised that it was a spray for the tongue instead of the nose.  I assumed sinus relief would be provided by a nose spray, so was very doubtful that this could make any difference to my nighttime sinus issues.  Ive been using it for about 4 weeks: 3 sprays on the tongue, 3 times a day.  I no longer awaken several times during the night unable to breathe through my nose.  Since I am not taking any new meds, I am confident that this spray is what has made the difference.  However, it didnt provide immediate relief.  I dont think three sprays to the tongue will immediately clear up your nose or itchy eyes, although I realize homeopathic remedies work differently for everyone.  In my experience, even though it promises to provide temporary relief for the symptoms of sinusitis, hay fever or other upper respiratory allergies, it didn't work that way.  It has a very mild taste which is inoffensive and dissipates almost immediately.  I am going to continue to use it since I think its cumulative effect has been to lessen the nighttime swelling of my sinuses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMQXVH81PEL1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085YJ41O#wasThisHelpful","RMQXVH81PEL1Y","AO96PLO6E3MJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO96PLO6E3MJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am 71 years old, so there is nothing in this world that will make my skin stunningly radiant, no matter what this product promises.  When used alone, it leaves an oily residue for about ten minutes until it is completely absorbed and it takes about the same length of time for the scent to dissipate.  For me, it is just too oily to use on its own.  However, I have found that I really like it mixed with my body lotion.  Mixing the two dilutes the oil a little while it enriches the lotion, and the mixture absorbs quickly.  I have very dry skin, so am always looking for a little extra moisturizing help.  Although Im quite happy with this product when has been mixed with lotion, Im giving only 3 stars because there are less expensive oils that blend with my lotion just as easily and effectively.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OIWVW1WDM4JQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GYB13OQ#wasThisHelpful","R1OIWVW1WDM4JQ","AO96PLO6E3MJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO96PLO6E3MJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These ear bags are easy to put on and (while I first needed a bit of practice in front of a mirror) I was soon able to put them on or take them off while walking or riding the Metro.  Once on, they are pretty secure and never came off in the wind.  They didnt interfere with my hearing (or my hair) and I was grateful to have them because my ears never once got cold.

"I have this trap in yellow and it was so successful last summer that I purchased it in blue for my daughters yard.  Using a combination of beer, vinegar, lemon juice, & dishsoap these traps fill with wasps and flies almost immediately (1 bottle beer, 2 Tbs white or cider vinegar, 1 Tbs lemon juice,  tsp dish detergent.)  Honey bees do not like vinegar, so it repels bees at the same time it attracts wasps. As soon as I found success with my wasp bait, I sprayed their nest areas after dark with a high pressure sprayer using: 1 gal water, 1 cup dish soap, 1 cup vinegar,  cup lemon juice,  cup peppermint oil. The soap, vinegar and lemon juice kill them and they hate the smell of peppermint. If any survived, they didn't return to their old nests. I now keep small containers with cotton balls saturated with baby oil and peppermint oil near the gutter entries that the wasps favored and so far none have returned.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF1EYYUYQNZ0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QMLDBS#wasThisHelpful","RF1EYYUYQNZ0M","AO96PLO6E3MJC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO96PLO6E3MJC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unfortunately it is not easy to find Kinder in the states and even harder to find Kinder Bueno bars because they are imported.  When I do, they have a premium price tag.  Occasionally we go to Cancun.  When returning I buy these from the Duty Free in the Cancun airport.  I was so excited to find these on Amazon and for a reasonable price.  I was a little worried that they might be stale or have melted and cooled.  I got the 10 pack package.  Each pack contains 2 individually wrapped Bueno sticks.  These arrived in perfect condition.  They are fresh and delicious.  I love the creamy milk and hazelnut center surrounded by crisp that's coated in milk chocolate.  I have to keep myself from eating them all.  They taste good.

"We've enjoyed quinoa for awhile.  When making it at home I want to use quinoa without chemicals and additives.  Nutria Organic Royal White Quinoa is USDA certified, non-GMO, and all natural.  We aren't vegetarians but we are trying to get more plant based foods into our diet.  Quinoa is a great way to do do so plus it's high in protein, fiber, flavinoids, and minerals magnesium, potassium, zinc and iron.  Some packaged quinoa is already pre-rinsed and ready to cook. This brand is not.  Makes sure you thoroughly rinse what you are going to used before cooking.  I have several fine mesh strainers so this step is not an issue for me. Quinoa is easy to make.  Use twice the water as quinoa, bring to a boil, reduce heat, then cover and cook for 15.  Once done, fluff with a fork and use how you like.  I like to add cooked quinoa to soup.

Philips Sonicare HX6013 ProResults 4 Pack Generic Replacement Heads from Protect IT have have saved the day.  You get 4 toothbrush heads for less than 1/2 the price of 2 Sonicare branded ones.  Since these are a generic brand, I was afraid that they wouldn't work well.  The fit perfectly on to my Sonicare handle.  They just push right on like they are supposed and they stay.  They also properly fit in the UV light sanitizer.  Each one has a different colored ring at the bottom so you can have one for each family member.  The toothbrush heads work great.  The bristles have varying lengths to get around and between teeth.  My teeth feel so clean after brushing.  You'd never know they aren't actually Sonicare brand.

"I've tried liquid pen liners in the past.  Can't say I liked them very much.  They didn't write well or smudge easily.  Some weren't a true black but blue underneath.  Anyway, I am quite pleased with Nikka Notto Express Liquid Waterproof Eyeliner.  The body of the pen is easy to grip and hold.  The felt tip comes to a fine point.  I have no problem drawing a line at the base of my eyelashes.  I can make it very thin or widen it out.  The eyeliner goes on smoothly.  This is a quick drying eyeliner.  You can make build out your line to make it wide but you need to work quickly.  I finally made my first little wing that I was actually satisfied with with this pen.  I love that it is waterproof.  This prevents it from smudging and smearing in the hot and muggy weather we have here most of the year.  The eyeliner stays put all day and night.  The intense black color is just that, intense.  Very bold and very black.  No blue or purple undertones.  Love it!

"HSI PROFESSIONAL makes professional, salon quality products for the hair.  They make both styling tools and hair care products.  I have been using HSI PROFESSIONAL's Smoothing Shampoo with Argan Oil for over a week now.  I'm happy to say I am seeing an improvement in the condition of my hair.  This is a sulfate free shampoo.  It contains Argan Oil as well as vitamins A, B, C, and D.  Together the nourish and soft hair.  My hair dry and a little damaged.  Plus it's prone to frizz.  I notice since using this shampoo that my hair is smoother and has more shine.  I actually need less product(serums, gels, etc) to tame, control, and style my hair.

"If you want the water to pour, than this is the shower head for you.  This is a rainfall style shower head in a square shape. Most shower heads these days contain a flow restrictor.  This is to lesson the amount of water flow to help with conservation and utility bill.  This shower head does not have the restrictor.  So water flows just like from a faucet.  We control it by how much we turn the water flow on.  The 60 rubber nozzles create a fantastic rainfall effect.  My husband loves to put this on full blast so it's a drenching, somewhat massaging rainfall.  Fortunately he takes quick showers, unlike mine.  Made from acrylic and brass, this shower head has a very contemporary look.  The perimeter square is clear acrylic, the inner chrome finished brass square is blue around the exterior.  So you can see it through the acrylic.  I have to admit, it looks pretty cool.  I feel like I'm in a fancy hotel while I'm getting clean.  Super easy to install, the 1/2"" standard outlet size just screws right on shower outlet.  Very well made to last through many long and high temperature showers, it comes with a 1 year parts warranty against manufacture defects.

"I have been using Retseliney Revitalizing Vitamin C Night Cream for about 10 days now.  I really like it.  The ingredients are 98.5% naturally derived and 70% organic.  Aside from vitamin C, this facial cream has tons of good for the skin ingredients like coconut oil, rose hip oil, macadamia nut oil, cocoa butter, etc.  It is super rich and creamy to put on.  It spreads easily though and absorbs quickly.  It has a mild scent of cocoa butter.  After apply my skin feels very soft, hydrated, and plumped a bit.  I like the results when I wake up.

"Square Rainfall Style shower head from AKDY looks great in our shower.  Works well too.  It's an 8"" square shaped shower head.  There are 81 evenly spaced nozzles.  They produce a wide coverage rainfall type shower spray.  I don't like to have to keep moving to get parts of my body under the water, so for me it is really nice to have have a shower head with a broad coverage area.  I also like to take hot showers.  The material of this shower head is ABS formed from thermo material which is able to handle the heat.  The face of the shower head has mirror polished chrome finish while the back is a flat matte black.  A simple yet attractive modern look that really updates the look of our shower.  Most importantly, this shower head works well.  There are no clogged nozzles.  The rainfall spray is relaxing with plenty of water and pressure to thoroughly wash and rinse clean.  Since it has a standard 1/2"" outlet size, it only took a minute to screw on.  A small roll of plumbers tape is included with the shower head, but we did not need it.

"Helix Naturals Long Handled Toenail/Fingernail Scissors are ok. The handling is nice. The handle grips grips are ergonomically designed to be comfortable to hold for both women and men. The body of the scissors is about 8"" long. This is very helpful for those that have difficulty reaching their toes for any reason. The length also makes it easier to work on another person's toes as you have more room to maneuver around. The blades aren't very sharp though. They serrated edges do not cut as easily or as cleanly as clippers. They actually kind of tear up the nail leaving the edge of the nail raged.  Plus it's not so easy to get around the corners or curved nails due to the thickness of the blades.  These scissors are made from sturdy materials but they need to cut better.

"I am very pleased with this trivet.  It is made of black cast iron in the shape of a cat head.  Cut from one piece, it is solid and sturdy with good weight to it.  It's not going to crack or break.  I feel secure placing hot plates, pots and pans on it.  It has 4 feet with rubber covers to prevent scratching.  When not being used to protect surfaces from the heat of hot dishes from off of the stove, out of the oven, or microwave, the cat face makes this a unique decorative piece.  Nice for animal lovers, especial of cats.  Quite the conversation piece too.  It does have a strong tar like odor.  To me it smells like just laid asphalt.  I put it out in the garage for a week.

"I am a new user of Sweet Almond Oil and I'm a fan.  Pure Body Naturals Sweet Almond Oil is cold pressed and 100% pure.  Sweet almond oil is loaded with nourishing nutrients  - vitamins A, B and E, calcium, potassium, magnesium, mono saturated fats, folic acids, potassium and protein.  Absorbs deeply to hydrate and heal dry, cracked, chapped patchy, flaky, and or irritated skin.  Does not clog pores.  Gives my skin a beautiful glow and soft and silky to the touch.  Sweet almond oil can be used from head to toe.  Excellent for the face.  Reduces dark eye circles, wrinkles and fights continued signs of aging.  I love to use it as an eye makeup remover.  Really gets off waterproof mascara.  I also use this for my hair.  A few drop rubbed into my scalp relieves itchiness and dandruff.  A few drops applied to my hair adds shine, controls frizz, softens and revives dry, damage strands.  I expected sweet almond oil to have an almond fragrance.  Instead it has a light nondescript nutty scent.  It's faint enough that this almond oil is commonly used as a carrier oil for essential oils for aromatherapy.  Excellent for massage as it's proven to relieve muscle pain and physical stress, adding a few drops of lavender makes for a truly relaxing experience.  I am surprised that the bottle is plastic and clear instead of amber glass as sweet almond oil will go rancid quickly when exposed to light and air.

"This is my first experience with tamanu oil and did not know much about it before receiving it.  Personally, I would give this product 3 stars because of the smell.  I really can't stand it.  It smells awful and actually gives me a headache.  To me it has a very strong bad herbal scent.  The odor lasts too.  I can't use this on my face, neck, chest or shoulders because of the scent.  I don't think it's fair to deduct 2 stars just from the scent alone though as this is a 100% natural product.  No fragrance is added.  I wasn't expecting the dark green color.  It rubs into the skin and the color dissipates completely.  Does leave a bit of sheen behind but is not too greasy despite being a thicker oil.  Tamanu oil is supposed to be good for treating nail fungus and  psoriasis and eczema due to its anti-viral and antioxidant properties. Anti inflammatory and pain relieving properties make tamanu oil a good ointment for blemishes, burns, scratches, and bug bites.  This oil is also used for skin regeneration and hydration for firmer, younger looking skin.  I got a little bit of a sunburn on the top of my feet.  I also had a few mosquito bites on my lower legs.  I applied a small bit to both.  Both the bites and burns were soothed with reduced redness.  For those that don't mind the smell, tamanu oil has a lot of uses.

Plus it's weather and water resistant.  Smartly designed, both the solar panel and the LED light adjustable to tilt as needed. A spike for staking into the ground and hardware for wall mounting are included.  The 200 lumen LED lights(4) are very bright.  Fully illuminates are walkway up to the door on high.  There are also low and off options.  Love that this is solar powered.  Makes this light ecofriendy and does saves me us money as all power comes from the sun.  Plus we do not need to leave the porch light on when we go out now.  Fully charged the light on high should last 5-6 hours and 9-12 hours on low.  It automatically turns on at dusk and turns off with enough light at sunrise.  On low it does last all night.  I get up a little before sunrise and it is still on.

"The Ozeri Body Tape Measure and Body Fat Test Caliper Combo Pack is useful.  Whether you're a professional body builder or if it's your first time walking around the block are nice to have.  Sometimes it's hard to tell what gains are being made by only checking your weight.  The tape measure works pretty well.  I can pull it out as far as needed, then put the end in the slot.  Hit the button and it tightens up so I can get an accurate measurement.  The tape measure goes out to 78 inches.  The fat test calipers seem a bit cheap and flimsy, but they do the job.  Takes a bit of practice though.  This is a very affordable set.  It small and light too so it's easy to take when traveling, keep in a gym bag, etc.  As I'm looking to drop a pants size but gain muscle tone, this set is going to be very useful.

As we have mostly tile floors in our home, even with nonskid backing the pets knock them around.  They sometimes slide from under our feet too.  This double sided tape from XFasten prevents that.  Now our area rugs, mats, and runners stay in place.  In the kitchen, bathroom, in front of the doors, living room, this stuff works on smooth and textured surfaces.  When we want to, the tape is easy to pull up and remove.  Doesn't leave any residue behind either.

"I got these compression foot sleeves for my husband.  He wears size 11 shoes, so I ordered the L/XL option.  They fit tight, which my husband likes for the support.  The problem is the band close to the toes.  This is way tighter than it should be.  It actually squeezes is his toes together a bit.  Also the stitching there doesn't make sense.  There is a thick seam there.  It is not like that on the top band on the leg.  Not sure why it's like this here.  Makes it very uncomfortable to stand on for any length of time.  No way one would wear them for sports.  Good for wearing after though when lounging around.  Does bring relief to his feet.

"When I ordered this dress the listing said ""Eudolah Women's Scoop Casual Mini Dresses"".  It has now been changed to ""Eudolah Women's Short Chiffon Brightly Sequins Homecoming/Prom Dresses"" but the casual dresses are still there in the options to purchase.  All of the information is only for the sequin dress though.  The casual dress is a scoop tanktop styled dress.  It was one size that was supposed to fit up to a 10/12.  Maybe they meant little kids because it definitely isn't for women.  I wear a size small dress and this is pretty tight.  There is not size or material information on or with the dress.  For sure it is made of cotton with a bit of stretch, probably some spandex content.  The material is soft.  I got the red color and it is very nice.

"Radha Beauty's Aloe Vera Gel has just 3 ingredients in it.  They are organic aloe vera fillet, carbomer(thickener made from acrylic acid) and vitaminc(preservative).  There isn't organic certification on the bottle anywhere.  It does say the aloe vera is grown and produced in the USA.  Love that.  I also love that there isn't any green coloring added.  This gel is colorless and clear.  Has a light fragrance.  Unlike many other aloe gel products I've tried, this one is not thick.  It is thin and light.  It spreads easily and absorbs rapidly.  I can apply from head to toe, even my face.  It leaves skin soft with zero residue of any kind.  It really soothes and moisturized dry, itchy, irritated skin.  Great for sunburns or abrasions.

"We love love hammocks.  We always use them wherever they are provided, usually on vacation.  This hammock is made from 100% high strength breathable nylon fabric.  Perfect for a single user and easily accommodates the two of us together.  The material is smooth, not at all itchy or scratchy.  I love that it is portable and so lightweight.  When not up in our backyard we can take it with us to the beach, hiking, camping, etc.  The carry bag is attached to the hammock and serves as a convenient pocket when the hammock is opened up.  Can hold my phone, table, flashlight, snack, water bottle, etc.  I was worried the hammock would not pack back up into the pocket/bag very easily but I had everything stuffed back in there in less than a minute. So nice that it packs up so quickly and easily, ready to go in a moment's notice.  Comfortable, attractive, and well made.  We'll be enjoying this hammock for years.

"I am a big fan of this Gentle Detox Tea form Total Tea in K-cups for your Keurig brewer.  There is a good bit of sediment left in the packaging when you remove a K-cup.  I brew them on the 10 ounce cup size.  This tea has a great citrus and cinnamon aroma and flavor.  It's very smooth to drink.  There is not bitterness.  I actually like sipping it as is without any milk or sweetener.  This is a 100% natural herbal tea.  It is also gluten Free and Kosher Certified with no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives.  The blend of 10 herbs is supposed to provide gentle detoxification to remove waste, cleans the GI tract, and reduce inflammation.  This should reduce bloating and provide a greater felling of well being.  I believe it is working.  It's an enjoyable tea I would drink anyway.  So these benefits are a plus.

"Pictures do not do this bracelet justice.  It is an eye catcher.  I have worn this Austrian crystal bracelet from Mondaynoon  every day since it arrived a week ago.  It's brilliant.  I order the purple-blue color.  They look like tanzanite.  The radiant cut Austrian crystals really catch the light and sparkle.  The 17 stones match very well in color.  The metal is Medical Grade Stainless Steel 316l.  With a high shine mirror polish, it looks like sterling silver or white gold.  Plus it won't cause skin irritation or discolor.  Luxury style at an amazingly affordable price.  The links and clasp are solid.  Very sturdy piece that will stand up to years of wear.  Looks fabulous with a little black dress or T-shirt and jeans.

"An affordable PAIR of pillows that are more than worth the price.  These down alternative polyester fiber are so comfortable.  My husband is a bit picky about pillows.  It has to have that right amount of softness for comfort and firmness for support.  These do!  He sleeps mostly on his back and the Comfy Solution with medium firm support cradle his head and neck just right.  He's sleeping better, much less restless.  I love that these pillow had basically no scent coming out of the package.  Lots of pillows regardless of the fill are a bit sticky and need to be aired out.

"HSI Professional 3rd Generation Flat Iron is a professional salon quality hair straightening iron.  Its 1"" plates can heat to adjustable temperature of 240F to 410F.  So it works well on all hair types.  I have coarse, wavy hair.  A higher temperature works best for me.  The solid ceramic plates and coils heat up quickly and maintain even heating.  Tourmaline ionic technology adds silkiness and shine to my frizzy hair as the flat iron is smoothing it out.  I love that this flat iron is versatile in that I can create curls and flips with it too.  It's so easy to use.  It's designed to be comfortable holding.  My hand doesn't cramp, but part of that is because I'm able to straighten my hair so quickly now.  The 360 degree swivel cord means no tangles and I can rotate the iron as needed when using with no issues.  I'm thankful HSI Professional includes a heat resistant glove.  This really helps out when I'm straightening my hair in the back.  It gives me more control being able to grab the end of the straightener.  There is also a sample of their Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment.  This stuff smells great, improves hair's condition, and protects from heat damage.  When I travel I can easily pack this flat iron with me in it's gorgeous red storage/carry bag.  Everything comes in a sturdy and quality sealed box with a red inner section that pulls out like a drawer.  Presents beautifully for gift giving.  Very well made to last a long time.

"Wow! Having a waterproof sports action camera is awesome! It's so much fun and it's amazing to be able to capture memories in pictures and video that I wouldn't have been able to before. DBPOWER Original EX5000 WIFI 2.0inch 14MP FHD Sports Action Camera is waterproof, durable, and comes with almost everything you need and then some. The only thing I had to supply was the memory card. I expected this though. No problem. This camera is even smaller and lighter than I expected. What's really cool is that it has a 2.0 inch LCD Display Screen to view real time HD pictures and videos. The big well known brand's model at this price point does not have any display at all. The display is important to me. I like to review my shots and videos. This DBPOWER sports camera also has WIFI. That other one does not. I love being able to operate the camera and review from my phone or tablet. Makes it easy to use a selfie stick and other mounted options. This kit comes with 2 batteries! That makes me so happy. It is very frustrating when a battery runs low. Now I will always have a backup battery. No nice and convenient. That other brand, the battery is not removable. A backup battery isn't even an option. It has to be plugged in to charge. The best part? This camera takes beautiful pictures and video with its 14MP Panasonic CMOS Sensor with 170 wide angle Lens. From family pictures to action video underwater while snorkeling. I am testing it all and loving it. I can't wait to take it on vacation. My husband uses it when playing sports. He appreciates that he can mount it to a chest harness, handlebars, helmet, etc. to catch the action from all kinds of angles. Lots of extras that usually have to be bought separately to be able to do this are included.

"Silicone Splatter Screen from Perfect Life Ideas makes cooking so much nicer for me, especially stove top and microwave cooking.  This is a large 11.875"" in diameter cover that has a slotted opening in the center.  It works wonderfully for me as a splash guard.  Cooking meats, sauteing veggies, boiling pasta, etc.  It prevents splatters from burning me and keeps the cooking area clean.  Plus I can do quick stirs when needed through the opening.  I don't even have to remove the cover.  I also love this splatter screen for the microwave.  Heating up soups and pasta sauces or food that pops always make a mess.  I try to use a paper towel to cover the dish, but that usually doesn't work too well.  No more splatter or popped food all over the microwave that has to be cleaned up.  You can also use this screen to cover mixing bowls and put the mixer through the opening.

"I bought two of these at full price, which was a fair price, given the great reviews it rec'd.  I believe the other reviewers 100%, but my experience was quite poor.  Both of mine had problems:First unit: 75 foot hose. It literally had a huge gash near the brass fitting.  It leaked 90% of the water so it was worthless.Second unit: 100 ft hose. The hose itself was so poorly placed into the brass fitting, that you had to hold the hose at an angle for the water to go through.  The poor manufacturing quality control made it so that the rubber was inserted into the brass fitting diagonally.  So it was like a hose that was folded up, and the water could not get through that fold.2 out of 2 being returned is poor.

"This thing has plenty of power and it pretty small (see pics 1 and 2 for dimensions and perspective).  I use it for EVERYTHING around the house, and you could even use this for commercial applications.  It's a very good size...But right above and in front of the trigger, there is a small plastic 'guard' that has a sharp-ish edge.  It rips a small piece of skin off my finger when I rotate the power selection dial.  Picture it: You are holding the pistol grip with your right hand.  You take your left hand and wrap it around the power dial (rotation) and your index finger got caught on the small orange/black knob in front of the trigger (pic 3).  If you used it this morning you'll remember to be careful of that protrusion.  If it's been months, you will forget and get a cut again.  Trust me.The battery lasts more than 10 mins at full discharge, it has a ton of power, no light or torpedo level (on mine, anyway).

"Used this to dethatch about 1000 sq ft of lawn.  Works great.  It doesn't plow, so don't buy it for that purpose, but it does cleanly remove the top 2"" of dead grass, weeds, etc., with general ease.  The tines have not broken or bent and the wheels are super smooth.One add'l plus is that the tines are spaced far enough apart to not rip out or damage your sprinklers.  Nice.  Most importantly, dethatching would cost me $200 each time with a local service firm, and so this paid for itself on the first use.  And I'm sure I will use it for many years.Very happy with this sub-$100 purchase, and didn't need to buy a separate hitch to connect it to my Husq riding mower.

And worse, the seller represented this as a 26 cubic foot unit when it's only a 25.4.  That is a notable difference.The steel is warped in several places, especially near the hinges.The water dispenser is SOOOO old school; the lights on the display aren't lights, they are colored plastic that mimic lights!!The water dispenser only allows small glasses to fit in.The wheels won't lock, it rolls when you pull the handle to open.Please learn from my lesson!!

"Since this was about $25, I figured it was a low risk item.  It was.  I installed it, which was super easy with a simple wrench, and the plumbing tape came included.Shoppers should know, the stream coming out of this is NOT pressurized.  So it feels pretty good and all, but if you want to save a ton of water OR if you want fast rate, high pressure jet spraying on you, this is not the right product.

"UPDATE:  I have now had this for 3 weeks and I discovered an additional feature.  The two bumpers that are on the toilet seat cover portion are mad of rubber, not wood.  Which is good!  So no loud slamming and cracking of the wooden seat!VERY smart design, which totally changes how the seat is:1. Installed2. Removed3. CleanedWIth other products, you place the seat in place, then install the screws into the bolt, which is underneath.  With this product, you do not first place the seat on the toilet.  You first install the screw into the bolt.  THEN, you place the seat on top of the lugs on the screws, so that you can always just completely take the seat off for future cleaning, without having to remove the screws,  Very smart.And, the bolt stays in place when you're screwing the screw into the bolt, by having a wing on the bolt that keeps the bolt in place so you don't have to hold it with your other hand.I have a beef with the manufacturer for one reason: Take a look at pic #3, the hardware is so loosely packed in the box, that it moves around and in my case, the seat had a scratch.  So it looks like there is something yucky on it, even though it's just a scratch!Good sturdy wood, nice design, nice weight to it.

"I bought this about 3 weeks ago on Amazon.  I have used it about every other day.  I am overall very happy:1. It doesn't take as much space in my garage as I feared (about 1/3 of one car space)2. The bands are smooth, it's not like it starts easy then gets hard, which is what some people have said3. Switching between exercises is far quicker than walking between stations at the gym4. My body gets sore after each workout.  AWESOME.It does suck for biceps though, unless you happen to be 6' 4"" and have short arms.  I am 5' 10"" and have very regular length arms, and so what happens is that the handles you use for biceps doesn't ""kick in"" until you have already done about 1/5 of the bicep curl.  The handles attach to the red bar you see towards the bottom of the machine.  So you stand in the curl position, and you start pulling up on the handles.  Then you realize that you are pulling up and up, but it hasn't started to bend the bar yet, then when you are well into the curl, it'll start to bend the weight bar back.Overall though, I'm very happy.  What I do to counter the bicep issue, is keep a set of dumbbells nearby and just use those.  Take a look at my pics they show how much of my 3rd car space gets used up by the machine.  It's really not bad!  I really love this, especially for chest, tricep and shoulder exercises.

"I got this backpack for transporting kids' supplies and lunches around, as I take my kids places.  It serves that purpose just fine.  But here are my theoretical beefs, that I think you'll want to hear about:1. The interior space is only 4 inches from front to back, maybe 4.25"".  It's only 5.5"" as advertised if you include the front pocket + the main compartment2. There is ZERO padding on the bottom.  So if you carry a backpack in it, make sure to put it down gently!!  I'm okay with this because I don't carry  my laptop in this bag.  But if I did, I'd put some packing foam on the bottom of the interior3. Make sure to review my pic of the side pocket (mesh).  It's too small for any bottles other than the standard 16.8 oz water bottle.  Forget about thicker coffee therms, etc.It's super light, not super heavy duty or a thick material.  Here are some more positives:1. The padding in the back is perfect, not too thick or thin.  It's about 1/3 of an inch thick2. The zippers are super, super smooth3. Straps are also padded ideally, kind of on the thin side, but technically it is padded4. I paid $11.  What a very good price for a backpack.See my dimensions... the advertised ones are slightly off!

"What an awesome book!!!!  Yes, it's true that there is not a ton of verbiage in this book, but it's meant to be fun and stir the imagination of little girls and boys that are of an age, where more than 40 words on a page are hard to retain.  It's meant for the reader (kid) to imagine their own adventures during a time of day when the rest of the world is asleep.So when you read this to/with your child, slow down and let them think over their own ninja fantasy, let them really get engrossed in the artwork and picture themselves as a kitchen-assassin, out to devour their own little treat, while others are sleeping away.If your kid likes this, you'll read it with them dozens of times.

"These work! If you have to choose between these and the produce keeper containers, get the containers. These crisper filters work, but to me not as well as the containers. I suspect how well the crisper filters work might depend on your refrigerator.I've had mixed success with these. In think it may because I was storing citrus and apples in the same drawer. I get better results when I remove the fruit from its packaging.  Still, these are worth the investment.My very minor complaint is that the suction cups are hit or miss.

"This product is amazing! I have all three sizes and the crisper filters. They work! The produce keepers work better than the crisper filters, but I really have no complaints when it comes to the money I'm saving.I did have an odd experience with the large model. I filled it with unwashed arugula and one day it smelled almost like sulfur. The arugula was packed in pretty tightly and the vents were closed. After that experience, I open the vent at least one day when keeping salad greens.I have used the large with washed and unwashed salad greens. As inconvenient as it is, I'd rather fill it with unwashed salad greens. If I get more patient with my salad spinner, I'll try washed greens again. (I just can't seem to get them bone dry with my salad spinner.)The medium and the small versions keep berries for what seems like forever. I purchased blueberries on a Monday or Tuesday. They were still perfect on Sunday -- unheard of in my house. The trick is to not wash the berries first. Also, make sure you don't put any damaged berries in the container. Moisture and juice are really not your friends. Be especially careful with blackberries and raspberries.Here are my complaints. They are significant to me, but the functionality of the product outweighs them: these are not dishwasher safe. Come on Oxo! Do better. The lids do not fit securely.

"I'm taking ""Workbook"" in the book's title very seriously as I write this review. I am reviewing it assuming that others have the author's other book, Shirtmaking, in their libraries. For me, it's the know-how (Shirtmaking) and the design (Shirtmaking Workbook) that make a powerful combination.  I am a beginning sewist with dreams bigger than my present abilities. With that said, Shirtmaking can stand alone. The Shirtmaking Workbook is too advanced and not practical enough for my skill set. I also find it more geared toward men's shirts. However, that's the author's passion, so that's ok.The one thing I wish there was more of is information on cuffs, my favorite part of a shirt. Or perhaps, there aren't as many cuff variations as there are collar variations These are covered extensively.The online content is a wonderful idea and really enhances the value of this book. The way it's presented was a surprise to me, but I think content is still being added.If shirts are or will be your thing, you should get this book. If you are content with patterns as you find them, you can pass on this workbook, but the original Shirtmaking book could improve your results.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WE9UQNY7FHEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589238265#wasThisHelpful","R2WE9UQNY7FHEW","A3LDQM3GCURG92","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDQM3GCURG92?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was so impressed with this mattress, I had to write my review after the first night! I have the just mattress, I will be upgrading to a Serta Perfect Sleeper boxspring soon.  Please note:  if your bed frame does not have a center support, you will need to purchase a new one. Otherwise, the warranty will be voided.Let me start with the obvious, this is a tall/deep mattress. I now have to get into the bed a little differently. Since this is my first pillow top, I'll need new bedding to accommodate the extra depth of the mattress.Now for the good part! I could instantly feel the difference as I got into bed. This mattress hugs you!! It in no way restricts your movement, but you just don't feel the need to move around (even before falling asleep) It's really an amazing experience. The soft pillow top really does its job. The effect is that you really don't want to leave the bed. It's just that comfortable.The mattress does isolate movement. I am awed that something so stable and firm in that sense can still be so soft. The mattress is so supportive. It feels like it was made just for me. In the morning, I felt well-rested and refreshed. I went to bed a tad bit sore, but I felt great when I woke up.Night 3My serious complaint is that I get hot. The temps have been a little cool and I'm still hot. I'm using the same bedding, including mattress cover, I did on my old mattress. I'm definitely warmer with this new mattress. The foam pillow top really does envelop you and it is supremely comfortable, but it doesn't breathe like a typical mattress.Night 4Apparently, I have mastered tight turns from my left to right sides while sleeping. I am notorious for sleeping with half the bed full of books, magazines, etc. while nothing falls to the floor. After four nights and a and a truly lazy Saturday, the mattress is showing a little wear. This is my first experience with a pillow top, so I'm not sure how the foam is supposed to recover.I changed the orientation of the mattress, so the head is what used to be the foot. If I lightly pull up on the fabric where the indentation is, it stays stays slightly lifted for a moment. If feels like there's a little space between the fabric and the foam. On other parts of the bed, it's very hard for me to pinch any of the cover. If the same thing happens next week, I'll go down to three stars.Two-week updateSo, the foam did recover and the side that I used to sleep on looks smooth again.  As a precaution, I will rotate the mattress once a month. I'm also trying to fall asleep in different places in the bed.Cotton mattress coverI ordered a 100% cotton mattress cover and it has really made a difference! This is much more comfortable than my old polyester cover. I am less hot than I was before, even with the same sheets and comforter.In a nutshell, I love this mattress. I didn't realize that it would send me on a build-a-bed shopping spree to get to 'perfect' sleepTo Maintain the Warranty1. Bedrails with center support2.

Unfortunately, Ribbon Rose is my least favorite of the Pip Studio designs in pink because it has so much red in it.

"So this is what a smart TV should do! My HDTV isn't smart on it's own. I had been using a Blu-Ray player to get it a brain.  Wrong move. I think the manufacturer has stopped updating the device. At least with the Fire TV Stick, I feel like I'll be able to get updates as needed with Amazon.Thanks, Amazon, for a way to get Prime content on my TV. Thank you for including other apps like Netflix. Everything runs so smoothly!  Netflix on my other device stops and starts.  No errors with the Fire TV Stick.  I'm really enjoying what I'll call bonus content like the Gaiam Channel and other workout channels. These channels have a more on-demand kind of feel and are really nice. The game selection seemed a little weak.I have a Fire Tablet and I have downloaded the Fire TV app on other devices. The app works nicely as a remote; it's taking some practice to get my swiping just right. Voice search runs without a glitch.Having a Fire Tablet is a plus. I do like switching screens as I move about the house. I have developed the habit of looking up info about the movies and shows as I watched them. Having IMDB on my Fire providing scene trivia as I watch on the TV is so cool.This is the complaints section. My major complaint is how Amazon continues to ignore Google's existence.

"This is my first Breville appliance and I am in love. Rarely do I write reviews so quickly after purchase, but this product inspires evangelism. I drink a lot of tea every day; it has replaced coffee. My microwave is broken and my stovetop tea kettle started dribbling. It was time for a change.This appliance is everything Breville promises and positive reviews have confirmed. It is truly amazing. If you are into tea, you'll be into this. I drink flavored tea -- white, green, oolong, black, rooibos and herbal. I'm thankful for the simplification this tea maker provides. I'll be perfectly honest and admit that I frequently used the microwave for single cups of tea. I'd memorized how long to heat the water for each type of tea. The stovetop tea kettle had me cutting back on my tea consumption! It took too long to boil the water and the trial and error on the temperature got real tiring real fast.I'm so loving this appliance! So far, I'm all about the custom setting. Teavana's Earl Grey Black and Adagio's Earl Grey Bravo require either a different temp or steeping time than the pre-setting for black tea. It's easy as pie to adjust the settings and steeping time.  These two teas have come out perfectly. I expect the rest of my collection will fare the same.2/16/15 update -- made a perfect cup of oolong. if I leave the basket in place, it also helps me to remember that I can steep my oolong more than once.Here are my gripes, major and minor.  I am a 'dishwasher-safe' kinda girl and it pains me the carafe is not dishwasher safe. You can't even clean it under running water. How inconvenient is that? My minor gripe is the water markings. Would it have killed them to use ounces too? Breville knew this product would be sold in the U.S. All metric markings is just inconsiderate.2/21/15 UpdateI know it was probably done for safety reasons, but having to remember to hit the keep warm button every time I replaced the carafe wasn't easy for me. However, after a week of use. I've decided that I don't like the keep warm function at all. I don't know if it's the heat or oxidation, but subsequent cups don't taste the same as the first. This is obviously more pronounced further from the brewing cycle. Now when I brew a pot, I pour my first cup and put the rest into a thermos (if it's going to be a long time between cups.)You will need the Revive cleaner Breville makes. I used it after a week and it really worked well. I couldn't take the staining any longer. I think I read that the staining makes the tea taste better. I guess I'll miss out on that benefit because I prefer the new and shiny look.Would I recommend this? Absolutely, but only for a real tea enthusiast or aficionado (I claim enthusiast.) It's too pricey for the casual drinker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M31HK5WJDDNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003LNOPSG#wasThisHelpful","R1M31HK5WJDDNB","A3LDQM3GCURG92","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDQM3GCURG92?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product free for review. It replaced my Simple Human Sensor Pump. I love that this touchless dispenser has feet that keep the base from resting directly on the countertop. In comparison to the Simple Human model, the controls here are less intuitive. Adjusting the amount of soap it dispenses requires a little more effort than I'd like.

I love pink and butterflies, so this works for me in such a beautiful way.It is simply beautiful. The whimsical pink butterfly reminds me of childhood make-believe tea parties and playing dress-up -- all happy memories. It looks so delicate and pretty that I feel like I could be English royalty or at least part of the nobility.  It's my happy escape.I love that it is dishwasher safe. The strainer has slits in it which allow more for more sediment and even smaller leaves to get through. I typically use perforated or mesh retainers, so that's a new experience for me.  It's certainly not a deal-breaker.I understand why it's a smaller size for the blooming teas.

"I recieved this set for free to review. The timing couldn't have been better. My increasing aches and pains were telling me I needed to restart my yoga practice. One of the things that bothered me when I was a yoga regular was slipping on the mat. I have a couple of pairs of yoga socks (the kind without space for individual toes) and they helped, but weren't a perfect solve. These socks are! Getting them on takes a little more time, but that's a small price to pay for a better yoga experience.  My only complaint is that the pinky toe seemed really long.I'd never tried yoga gloves before.

"I love this book so much, I stopped reading the hard copy and bought the Kindle version, so I could have it with me at all times. I love the refreshing approach the author takes with beauty. Basing it in a modern Christian perspective is very meaningful. The Scriptures used to set the foundation of the book were inspirational.I found the advice very helpful. The only thing that was a bit unclear was how to determine your coloring. The author included a link to her website for more information.  Perhaps one of the best things about the book is that she provides solutions that can work with any budget. This is really evident in the jeans chapter.

"UPDATED 8/27/14:Thank you so much to LegoGirl who pointed out there may be an issue with epilation and using the Lumea. I spoke with a really wonderful customer service rep and she said that you can epilate, but you need to wait until you see some hair growth before using the Lumea. I will edit my review accodingly and update as the weeks go by.I may change my rating and review as time goes on. Time will tell if this ultimately significantly slows my unwanted hair growth. I found the color chart for skin and hair confusing. My skin color doesn't fall into the last two categories and my hair color is black, which means I should be able to use this device. However, I am an African-American with coarse hair. I've been unable to use products like this in the past. So we'll see.For the most part, the product is easy to use. I sometimes have problems using it under my arms because of the sensor. (If your skin/hair combo is inappropriate for the device, it won't allow you to use it.) It will be working fine and then stop. I then switch to my leg, fire off one pulse and then go back to my underarm. It works fine after that.The sensation isn't the world's most pleasant. I can deal with my epilator, but level 5 on this is no joke.

While they did not completely eliminate the swelling, they felt better on my legs than other compression socks as the day wore on. They did develop a crease at the ankle, but I was able to pull them up a bit. The top didn't immediately roll back down. I just had to pull them up a few times. With other socks, I'd have to take them off once they rolled down the first time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHY3VXI4B5PUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7KJPUU#wasThisHelpful","RHY3VXI4B5PUF","A3LDQM3GCURG92","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDQM3GCURG92?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had the cord about six months. I purchased it to go with the high-speed adapter. Cord worked great, no issue with charging. My issue is that the cord has started to fray at the usb end. Some of the apps I use don't work with Kindle's auto rotate feature. The screen has to be oriented so that the power jack is at the bottom.

Kids, Infant, Child and Neutrogena Body Oil, Light Sesame Formula, Fragrance Free, 8.5 Ounce. This product is about the same in providing moisture.

"I used this for the first time to make chili and I am impressed! After a stainless Crock-Pot that boiled my food and a Hamilton Beach 33967A Set 'n Forget Programmable Slow Cooker, 6-Quart that died, I was starting to wonder if  I would have to upgrade to All-Clad to get the features I wanted and a good quality slow cooker. It was love at first brown with this baby.Being able to brown in the unit was unbelievable! What a convenience. I didn't have to kill myself trying to get all of the fond off the bottom of the dish because there was no need to transfer the food for slow cooking. I have to admit that I doubted whether or not it would brown properly, so I cranked up the temperature. Wrong move! The suggested 350 degrees was absolutely perfect. Once my chili was assembled, changing the cooking function was a breeze. There were no surprises during the slow cooking.So, I can vouch wholeheartedly for the awesomeness of the browning and slow-cooking functions.

"I've decided to do this review over time because this product makes some seven-day claims, so I think the best way for me to keep track is to log daily progress.Let me say I am a big fan of Jergens Glow Daily Moisturizer Med to Tan, 7.5 Ounce, Packaging May Vary and Nivea Sun-Kissed Beautiful Legs, for Medium to Dark Skin, 6.7 oz. I think Nivea gives you more shimmer, but I could be wrong. I'm excited to see what this product can do.I am African-American with light skin that tans easily. My skin has a yellow undertone and it is extremely dry in the winter. I feel like the testing is a bit unfair since it's freezing cold in Chicago now. Any lotion would be challenged. This brings me to my first point.Day 1This is not a deep-moisturizing lotion. You'll need backup if this is what you're trying to use it for. I could see this as a spring/summer option. I also would like to see just a hint of shimmer. I didn't see any, so I'm wondering about the ""illuminating"" claim.Day 2This product provides the slightest shimmer, almost imperceptible. Definitely not a winter lotion. My skin is dry hours later.Day 3I tried something new. Usually, I apply lotion after showering. Today, I applied this later in the day. It feels like any regular lotion on my skin.Day 4Meh. I'm ready to move on.Day 5When is day 7??! This stuff is okay for my arms which are less dry than my legs. I still can't see proof of the other benefits.Day 6This stuff moisturizes the best when I don't have to leave the house and face the cold, but it's still not worth me trading of my regular stuff.Day 7Thank goodness it's over!

"I received this scale free for review. I also have the OXO Food Scale, so this is more of a comparative review. I am an avid baker, so my scale gets a a lot of use. I'll start with the positives. This scale is gorgeous. It looks so clean and elegant on my counter. The display lights up with each use, so everything is sharp and easy to read. This is different from the OXO scale; on it, you have to press a button for the backlit display.This scale is very sleek and compact. Here is where things go from great to okay. If you use a really large bowl, it obscures the display. (The OXO display unit pulls out for this purpose.) This doesn't work for the heavy baking I do. For imperial measurements, the display uses decimals; I'm used to fractions. My last gripe is the special batteries it takes (minor in the overall scheme of things but important to me). What happened to good old AAA?With that said, I don't think this is a bad product; it just doesn't work for all of my needs.

"I'll start with the positives first. I love the style of this book. In a post YouTube, Craftsy world, I believe things have shifted in terms of how people like information presented to them. This book does a wonderful job of explaining the techniques in an easily-digestible fashion. The photography is excellent. You need to know how to make a bound buttonhole? This is the book for you.Here's why I give it only three stars: if I counted correctly, there are only eight techniques covered in the main section of the book (the part with the good photos). There are more in the appendix, but you get illustrations instead of photos. If I were making my first tailored jacket or pants, I'm not sure there's enough in this book to get me through it. For instance, there's nothing about linings.What I would love is a hybrid of this book and Couture Sewing Techniques, Revised and Updated. This book has depth, but lacks breadth. Couture Sewing Techniques has breadth, but I think it needs more depth via step-by-step pictures. Conversely, Couture Sewing: The Couture Cardigan Jacket, Sewing secrets from a Chanel Collector is perfect, because it has the right amount of depth for a single project. Maybe this book would have been better if it were two books -- one dedicated to jackets and one to pants.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16VW73URMXESJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600855040#wasThisHelpful","R16VW73URMXESJ","A3LDQM3GCURG92","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDQM3GCURG92?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this book for three years. Now, I think I can write an informed review. As the title may imply, this is not a book for the novice, which is why I struggled with reviewing earlier -- I just couldn't understand it. While my skills may not have improved much in three years, my sewing knowledge has and that's what this book requires.Others have spoken to this edition versus the previous ones. I can speak to, as someone relatively new to sewing, how this book compares to other couture sewing books. This book is a must-have reference. It covers a lot within its 12 chapters. I do take issue with how things are covered. The book gives very clear step by step instructions, but the illustrations are a bit lacking. I like the updated approach taken in Shaeffer's newer books, Couture Sewing: Tailoring Techniques and Couture Sewing: The Couture Cardigan Jacket, Sewing secrets from a Chanel Collector. These text are easier to grasp because of the step-by-step photography. They layouts are cleaner and overall feel more modern. The DVDs are wonderful aides.To be fair to the publisher, I'm sure photography and DVDs would have added exponentially to the cost; I'm inclined to think it's worth it. Now, what's missing from the newer books is the history and background in Couture Sewing Techniques. It's that information that makes for good reading. It tells you why a particular technique is important. I like having that info.I guess if you are an experienced home sewer or professional, this book is a five-star deal. As someone who is self-teaching, this book is unnecessarily advanced in terms of presentation, not content. I'm hoping the next revision is more along the lines of her newer books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R168VH6XDQV75L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600853358#wasThisHelpful","R168VH6XDQV75L","A3LDQM3GCURG92","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDQM3GCURG92?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The pieces in my unit don't fit together properly. One of the ""branches"" won't fit tightly onto the post because there's extra metal sticking up around the hole where the screw goes.

"This is one of the best sewing books! I'm fascinated by the classic Chanel jacket because of it's iconic status and exquisite craftsmanship. I'm not one for designer labels, but I want a similar jacket for the quality. As a home sewer, it's one of those garments that done well, will be a source of pride for years to come. This book will help you get there.Three cheers for a book dedicated to the subject. I was wondering why this hadn't happened before. However, it is worth the wait! I love getting a sneak peak into Shaeffer's personal collection. The garment index makes interesting reading.On to the making of the jacket. Shaeffer starts at the beginning -- with suggested fabrics and a good pattern. Of course there is a section on the famous trims. There's a detailed resources section in the back of the book; you'll know where to go for what.The book assumes you can manage diagnosing and correcting any fit issues on your own. You'll do this with a toile. In terms of construction, this book breaks down a very daunting process into digestible chunks starting with the quilting. This is still advanced stuff and obviously includes tailoring. Please bone up on your hand stitches.  There are chapters on buttonholes, the three-piece sleeve, edge finishing, hand-set sleeves, patch pockets and finishing.Perhaps my favorite chapter is ""What Makes Chanel's Cardigan Jacket Different."" I love it for the historical perspective. It helps ground you as you think about what you want your finished jacket to look like.In the DVD, you're walked through each step of the construction process. The DVD and the book can stand alone as complete instructional tools. Together, they are awesome. I will say that based on the reviews, I'd decided not to purchase Couture Sewing: Tailoring Techniques. After watching the DVD that accompanies this book, I will purchase Couture Sewing:  Tailoring Techniques for the DVD. If the DVD instruction is as good as it is on this DVD, it's worth the purchase.If you want to make your own Chanel-style cardigan jacket, this book is a must. As other reviewers have mentioned, the techniques here are specific to construction a Chanel-style jacket, but they will help make you a better sewer as you apply them to other projects. This is a great addition to any sewing library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DG1I7J9KT1O0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600859550#wasThisHelpful","R2DG1I7J9KT1O0","A3LDQM3GCURG92","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDQM3GCURG92?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this case because I thought it was the best of the limited options I had for the Fire HDX 8.9"" around Christmas. The case is good quality. It took me a day or so to get used to it. I love to hold my Kindle portrait style and read it like a book. Unfortunately, this is easier to do without the case because the Kindle is so light and the case adds more weight than expected.The design is really cool. It's the best feature. You need to place the Kindle on a harder surface to take full advantage of it.In terms of protection, if the cover is pulled back, the Kindle is very vulnerable to damage. When trying to use the Fire in bed, I have had it come out of the case a couple of times. I dropped it yesterday and the Kindle bounced out of the case. I don't like having to slide the device out of the case in order to take photos; I wish slots for the camera had been cut in the the case. I also wish that the device sat deeper in the case so that the edges of device were flush with the case. My cell phones feel better protected in their cases, but I don't expect this device to take as much wear and tear as those do. However, dropping the Fire is a much more costly prospect.Lastly, why isn't pink a color option?As more manufacturers start making cases, I will check to see if something better comes along. This case will do for now, but It's not ideal. The leather case looks great, but it's not worth the money because your device isn't protected very well. I'm really disappointed in Amazon.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OZA9LMLH9G7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DR0C96S#wasThisHelpful","R1OZA9LMLH9G7U","A3LDQM3GCURG92","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDQM3GCURG92?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like my new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, but I'm not not in love with it. I've used the iPad, iPad mini and Blackberry Playbook, so I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted in a tablet. In the end, I narrowed it down to the Kindle Fire and iPad because I'm a member of Prime and I wanted to view Amazon streaming video on on a mobile device. Also, my favorite apps are not available for Android devices. I chose the Kindle Fire because of price and I know I will still one day get an iPad. So, the Fire is my iPad Mini. In terms of functionality, and I'll discuss this more below, the Fire is more reader and less tablet.With all that said, here's what I do love about the device -- it's a great value. The size is perfect for reading and I do love to hold it portrait style and read it like a book. If I feel really daring, I do so without the origami case so that I can appreciate how lightweight it is. The Amazon leather origami case is a really cool idea, but not great protection. Took me a day or so to get used to it. I do wish is was lighter and I wish I could get it in pink.I like the organization of my stuff -- carousel, home page/favorites and collections. I do have suggestions for improvements:1. I wish you could add web pages to the carousel2.  I wish the tablet would learn that just because I used something recently, I don't want it in the carousel.3.  I wish the collections could be for more than apps. For example, for my morning devotion time, I would love a collection that contained my gospel playlist, Bible reading apps and certain Kindle books.4.  There's no way to organize picturesMayday is so sweet. Although, I've realized that the help is really about technical issues, not bigger questions like why can't the device run Google apps. Still, this is an awesome feature if you a gifting the Fire to someone who is not tech savvy.As expected, the Amazon apps work great. I would like more visual notification to indicate which movies and TV shows that can be downloaded to the device. It should be just as easy to spot as the Prime indicator.The biggest disappointment with the Fire is no Google apps (as of January 1, 2014). This is why I consider the Fire more of a reader and less of a tablet. Without Google apps like Drive, Google Maps; YouTube and the full cadre of Android apps (like Instagram), this device fails to be a really serious workhorse. For those who use Chrome, you never realize how much you depend on it until it's gone. Don't be confused by the Google apps you see in the Amazon Appstore. These are workarounds developed by others; there are no Google apps, developed by Google, in the Appstore. You can sideload some Anddroid apps onto the Kindle (and I have done so for Instagram and PocketBible), but my point is that I shouldn't have to.If Google and Apple can find common ground, I simply don't understand why Amazon has to be so territorial with the Kindle. I'm wondering if this is the same marketing mistake Blackberry made with the Playbook; the marketplace has pretty much decided that we need two mobile operating systems, iOS and Android. I'm sure Amazon will say that developers have the option of putting versions of their apps in the Amazon App Store, but the fact that many haven't says something.Being forced to live without Google apps has forced me to discover a new favorite app -- Feedly, for blog reading. I've downloaded it to my Android and Apple devices.My next biggest issue with the Fire is the Special Offers. (I know I have the option of removing them for $15.) I'm complaining not because they are there, but because they are so 'untargeted' to me. Amazon has more than a decade of my purchasing history, wish lists, web data and tons of my reviews. Serve me ads for stuff you'd think I'd buy. I was expecting Special Offers to be so much better -- as good as recommendations on my Amazon.com homepage. The Special Offers are generally crappy because I have no interest in the products.Update 2/17/14: I have found a bug in the music playlists. I create my playlists on the cloud using my Kindle. I then dowload them to the device. All of the songs are already saved to the device before I download the playlist. However, songs will be missing from the downloaded playlist. The cloud version has 117 songs, the on-device version has three. Mayday and customer support gave me a solution. So, I uninstalled all music from the device and downloaded it all again from the cloud. I then downloaded the cloud playlists and the problem was solved -- for a few hours. Later, when I updated and created new cloud playlists; uninstalled the device playlists; and downloaded the cloud playlists again, songs were missing.Update 3/15,14: After weeks of back and forth, the issue above was resolved with a replacement Kindle. My cloud playlists loaded onto the device without a hitch. I haven't revised the cloud versions and tried to reload onto the device yet; no new songs have caught my ear. I have to say the getting the issue resolved left me very frustrated. Amazon's usually stellar customer service just didn't bring its A-game. I was so relieved when the rep I spoke with a week ago agreed to ship me another device. It took way too long to get to that solution.I find the speed to be slower than my iPhone and Galaxy phone.  I used all three while playing my favorite mobile game via Wi-Fi. When response time matters, I go for the iPhone instead of the Fire.My Fire has a problem connecting to free Wi-Fi. I haven't hit the Mayday button yet to figure out if it's something I'm doing wrong. The device will connect, but it takes a long while for it to tell you that you need to go to the provider's web page to agree to the terms and conditions. Opening the Silk browser yourself to get to the permissions page doesn't always work.I ordered the 16GB version based on other reviewers' comments regarding Prime movie and TV downloads. If I had it to do over again, I would have given more thought to the 32 GB because I have the Wi-Fi version. If I had gotten Wi-Fi+4G, 16 GB would have been just fine because I would have always had the connectivity to stream what I wanted to watch.All in all, the Fire isn't a bad purchase.

"I love, love, love this teapot. First, I love its understated design; it feels modern and classic. Also, it just looks good in a stainless steel/black kitchen. It holds about 50 oz of water, which brings me to my second love -- it's huge! The capacity is great for entertaining. Or, if you are like me and drink multiple cups a day, brew a pot of tea in the morning and transfer it to a carafe. Last and best, the large spout means it doesn't get clogged with tea leaves. It pours beautifully! Now you don't have restrict the movement of your tea during brewing by using an infuser. Your cup of tea will be better for it. This pot is a must buy for anyone who brews loose leaf tea!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L4N4UVDS9OOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HD9TDO#wasThisHelpful","R3L4N4UVDS9OOP","A3LDQM3GCURG92","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDQM3GCURG92?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the Fabulous Fit fitting system. I have have a Dritz My Double Deluxe Dress Form, Medium. These pads made padding out the form much easier. The contoured pads come in multiple shapes and the instructions are VERY clear. I just picked my fitting issue and then used the pads to represent the issue correctly on my form. This is the second dress form I've padded it out and let me tell you, it takes FOREVER to do this with batting. The pads are a wonderful assist. You should still grab a bag of batting to help fill out the form.As amazing as the pads are, I wouldn't suggest this product for everyone. If you can sew a pattern pretty much straight from the envelope with minor alterations, you really don't need these pads. However, if you have multiple fitting issues that require substantial pattern adjustments, you need these pads. They really save you some headaches if you fit your garment on your form as you sew.My form is a 3/4 form, so they were kind enough to send me one of the knit covers for the 3/4 form. I think you get would normally get two of the other covers.My only criticism is the actual foam. I don't like how it changes color over time. Granted, you can only tell if you're staring at the form. I wish the pads were rubber instead.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCPKVQOP24FSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DYF0EK#wasThisHelpful","RCPKVQOP24FSW","A3LDQM3GCURG92","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDQM3GCURG92?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know absolutely nothing about hand stitching. I avoid it like the plague. I purchased this book to overcome my ignorance and fear. After falling in love with the Great British Sewing Bee, I realized I needed to know how to sew by hand and I was so inspired by what the finalists were able to do without a sewing machine.So here's what I needed the book to do: cover the basic hand stitches used in garment construction: basting, slip stitch, running stitch, overcasting, tailor's tacks and hemming stitches, etc. The book does all that plus covers more. There are more than 35 ""Functional Stitches"" in the book. I love the large step-by-step pictures. This book has more breadth, but not necessarily depth than The Complete Book of Sewing New Edition.Since I'm even more clueless about embellishment, the book seems awesome in this regard. Again, the large pictures are wonderful. I had no idea there were so many different types of decorative stitches and techniques. This is Chapter 3 and consists of about 40 different stitches/techniques. There's even a directory of motifs!The information on thread, needles and pins is thoughtful. Of course there is info about hoops and frames. There are a few topics in the book that are a nice surprise, but seem odd for a book on hand sewing:  measuring for drapes and dressmaking, reading sewing patterns, estimating fabric requirements for dressmaking, types of zippers and info on pressing. Maybe it's just me.It's a good, solid book. It is extremely well organized. (Within each chapter and subsection, stitch are presented in order of skill level.) Buy it more for the information on decorative hand sewing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30UH5E5G63OFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596687568#wasThisHelpful","R30UH5E5G63OFD","A3LDQM3GCURG92","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDQM3GCURG92?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a sewing nerd. I have to be because sewing is something I don't seem to have a natural talent for. I have to work at it. Although my mother, stepmom and aunts used to sew and sew well, the gift seems to have almost skipped a generation. My saving grace consists of books and online classes. So glad I can count this book among that number.I will be perfectly honest in that I didn't buy this book for the pattern. I bought it for the techniques and that is what I'm reviewing. Because this book contains a pattern, I'll use The Colette Sewing Handbook: Inspired Styles and Classic Techniques for the New Seamstress and Sew Serendipity: Fresh and Pretty Designs to Make and Wear for comparison. Both are wonderful books that not just help you construct the included patterns, they teach you how to sew. The same is true for this book. The Colette Sewing Handbook is the best of the three because of breadth and depth. Sew Serendipity and this book are more similar because both really whet your creative appetite with embellishment and customization.Here are my specific love notes about this book:1. The reason I bought the book was because it teaches you how to line the skirt. I am so frustrated about the lack of linings in ready-to-wear fashion and the how-to in most skirt patterns.2.  The information is presented clearly. The photos are great!3.  The skirt variations are cuteI do think the book lacks in some areas. The first is fit. Although the pattern is sized to 20, there are no instructions for how to alter the pattern if you need a bigger size. What if you find that either the front or back hem is longer than the other? There's no info on how to resolve the issue. I know that's a problem I will have, but I know how to fix it.The book doesn't have any information about fabric choices or preparation. The technique I wish the book included is how to use hem lace. The book has four options for hems: turned and stitched, rolled, bias and ruffled. I realize I'm being extremely picky.This book is for the beginner stitcher. She or he will be able to get a quick win with this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34QZ8Y5E0YXQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607056690#wasThisHelpful","R34QZ8Y5E0YXQG","A3LDQM3GCURG92","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDQM3GCURG92?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my new favorite book on fit. I have a gazillion books on fit, so that's high praise. Here's why -- clarity. You will learn how to read wrinkles and drag lines and correct them. For me, this was an eye-opening approach to fitting -- it's all about the muslin.Let me get back to the clarity. The title gives you a clue -- the photography is some of the best I've seen in a sewing book. I sincerely hope it becomes the new standard. The book is also well-written.  The author covers a number of fitting concerns and explains each very clearly. I hadn't seen the concept of the horizontal balance line before and I love it! It is very helpful.The beauty of this book is the muslin photography. It really helped me understand exactly what I was seeing as I evaluated my own garments. Most of my other books use drawings and it's just not the same.Once you have identified your issues via the photography, the book does teach you how to alter your patterns. When it comes to the pattern work, I switch to more in-depth alterations books like Fit for Real People: Sew Great Clothes Using ANY Pattern (Sewing for Real People series) or Pattern Fitting With Confidence, depending on which alterations method I want to use (slash and spread, pivot and slide or the seam method. If you have a good grasp of pattern alterations, you may not need the supplemental books.I do have to give the author credit for the ""Fundamentals of Altering Patterns Chapter. Many seasoned stitchers may already know this info, but for newbies it provides a one-stop shop for the process of altering patterns. They way it's written underscores that when doing alterations, you've kind of become a pattern drafter. Here's some of what the chapter contains:-Blending Seams, Using the Rulers and Adding Seam Allowances-Lengthening and Shortening Patterns and Grainline Arrows-Walking and Truing a Pattern-Placing and Creating Notches-Controlling Patterns with Built-in Ease-Truing Difficult Seams-Moving the Placement of a Seam-Moving a Dart to a New Location-Truing Dart Legs-Scaling Patterns Up and Down-Working in an Efficient OrderI think this book is a must-have!

"Let me start by saying I don't think this book lives up to it's title. It's a strong promise and I'm not sure what I'd need to see in a book to live up to ""Flatter the Curves You Want To Keep and Drape the Ones You Don't.""  Perhaps I'd like more suggestions and how-to for design elements that would help achieve the promise.This book starts at the beginning - seriously with Essential Sewing Equipment and a Fabric Glossary.  Because of the title, I was expecting more intermediate info.Next is a very nice section on the body shapes:  hourglass, triangle, inverted triangle, round and oval.  For each figure type, you get an illustration, description of the body type, flattering styles, looks to avoid and appropriate fabrics.  The styles and fabrics are summarized in a check list.  There's nothing new here, but it's nice to see it included in a sewing book. It has examples of sewing patterns that work for each shape. To live up to the ""flatter and drape"" part of the title, more examples here would have been helpful.Next up is choosing and reading patterns, transferring markings, measurements and layouts.  There are a couple of pages on seam allowance and ease. Meh.The Adapting Patterns section is pretty good.  I really like how this part of the book has a mini table of contents. For each subchapter listed (Shoulder, Neckline, Bust, Hollow Back, Sleeve Length, Armhole, Waist, Hip, Stomach, Bottom, Crotch Depth and Height), there is a brief summary of potential fit issues.  A very brief Dos and Don'ts for jacket sleeves, pants length and skirts follows; it's mostly about proportion.  The alterations are photographed clearly (think The Complete Photo Guide to Perfect Fitting.)  A few garment construction tips are also included.The book includes a chapter on Making a Toile.  It's pretty detailed regarding how to correct its fit.  The book ends with Core Techniques, which covers basic sewing skills.I got the impression that this was a book for sewing for plus sizes. It may have been my mistake. Sewing for Plus Sizes: Creating Clothes that Fit and Flatter is a wonderful book on sewing for plus sizes.I guess the beauty of the book is that you get some fashion info with your pattern fitting and alterations info. Great information and it is a clear, concise read. Unfortunately, the book does not bridge the gap well enough between here's what you should wear and how to make it happen. Instead of just showing me how to adjust a standard pattern for wide hips, show me ways to change the neckline of a top to draw attention away from my hips. If part of the answer includes embellishment, show me how to apply trim or add studs.I do like seeing photographs and illustrations of ""real women."" You can get a more in-depth fashion info about fitting your shape from Curves Rule and Flat Is Fabulous: Sexy, Stylish Looks for Every Figure and/or The Science of Sexy: Dress to Fit Your Unique Figure with the Style System That Works for Every Shapeand Size.  There are certainly more in-depth alterations books out there.If you are new to sewing, this may be a good starter book. It's not overwhelming and it covers basic skills while providing sound fashion advice. As your skills progress, you'll need to expand your library. If you're also clueless about what looks good on you, this book is a lucky strike extra.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33HSYDY7IS9RV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1438000952#wasThisHelpful","R33HSYDY7IS9RV","A3LDQM3GCURG92","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDQM3GCURG92?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The best caramels are homemade, full of butter and cream. But who has time? Not to mention the mess it makes. These soft cremes are a convenient and very tasty replacement. This tin is huge, 2.25 pounds, and thats a lot of cremes, and a lot of goodness. Sure, they dont have all the butter and cream, but those ingredients dont travel all that well.  The texture is very soft and creamy. There are three flavors in the tin, caramel, vanilla and caramel, and butterscotch and caramel. The first two are very good, and the butterscotch and caramel is good, but I wish it had more of a butterscotch flavor. It has only a hint of butterscotch.

"I am now the proud owner of three of these panini/grill/griddle appliances, one by Cuisinart, one by George Foreman (the Evolve system, which more or less doesnt have a griddle plate), and this DeLonghi. Each has its good points and bad points; however, right now I prefer the DeLonghi.It works very well, and I really like the ceramic-coated grill and griddle. The controls are among its best features. I like that they are flat at the front of the device as it makes them extremely easy to read and to manipulate. Using this device is a no-brainer. By contrast, the George Foreman has electronic pushbuttons that are confusing and make you press them again and again. The Cuisinart has the controls vertically on the front, so I have to bend down to read them or to change a setting.I like that this device can be used as a panini press, with the top down, with heating elements on top and bottom, or open up flat where you can cook on each of the two surfaces. You cannot do that with the George Foreman.Of my three devices, it is easiest to remove and replace the plates on the DeLonghi. There is only one button to push to disengage the plates, and on replacing them there are two slots they slip into and then click. The plates are also clearly labeled as to which is the upper and which is the lower. That seems trivial, but I found it annoying on the other two competing devices.The appliance heats up in a reasonable time, and there is a green light to let you know when it has reached the desired temperature. It seems to hold the correct temperature very well, much better than the Cuisinart.It has a searing temperature, the maximum temperature, of 450. Thats not quite as high as the George Foreman which reaches 500 but it is sufficient for most uses.There are still a few improvements that could be made. The grease drip cups are quite awkward. There is no slot in which they can be engaged. You simply place them below the drainhole. They can easily be bumped with an elbow and then you have grease dripping. They also have to be stored separately.The griddle plates and the grill plates are also separate which means only one can be stored in the machine, and you have to store the other separately. The Cuisinart has reversible plates, so there is no storage issue, and the grease catcher also stores within the Cuisinart itself.The Panini press feature also seems just a bit heavy. The manual suggests a sturdy bread such as ciabatta. I definitely would not use a soft bread in this machine with the top down.So, all in all, of my three choices of this type of appliance, the DeLonghi is my current favorite. It is not perfect, but it has more options that the George Foreman, and it maintains temperature better than the Cuisinart.  It is also the easiest to use.Update:I have now had this for a while, and I have to report one very annoying problem that is causing me to knock several stars off.  I don't cook very often, and I'm sure I've used this appliance less than a dozen times.  Today I used it for the first time in several weeks.  I cooked some chops from frozen, and even with the lid closed, there was some grease splatter on the control panel.  I took a damp paper towel with a little Dawn detergent on it and wiped the panel.  No abrasives, no scrubbing.  So it is shocking to report that all -- all -- of the markings on the control panel wiped off.  Seriously, there is nothing left.  No temperature markings, no indicators of any kind.  This is absurd.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BPX8LAMAI3GF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BHEBVA#wasThisHelpful","R2BPX8LAMAI3GF","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A few months ago, I purchased a slow cooker.  It sat in the box while I tried to figure out something to make in it that wasnt more trouble than it was worth.  The stupid things dont brown or saut.  Hmmm, sure wished I had one of the new multi-cookers.And now I do, and all I can say is the slow cooker, still in the box but not worth returning (I got it on a lightning deal and it would cost as much to send it back), so its going to the Salvation Army or Goodwill.This Philips Multi-Cooker browns and slow cooks.  It also steams (a steamer basket is included), bakes, reheats, slow cooks, browns, and just about anything else you can think of.  So far, I have used it to steam various vegetables, reheat frozen pot roast, and making a big pot of slow-cooked chicken paprikash (after sauting the onions and chicken in the same pot).  I really want to bake the chocolate walnut cake in the recipe book.  Yes, you can bake in it.  It also makes rice and risotto, but I have not tried that feature as I spent a ton of money on a Zojirushi rice cooker at the same time I bought the slow cooker/doorstop.It worked like a charm in each instance.  The frozen pot roast, I usually defrost a day in the refrigerator.  Only I forgot.  So it went in the Multi-Cooker, a huge hunk of frozen meat, potatoes and gravy.  It came out perfect.  The paprikash can be made on a stove, but its a mess as it simmers and splatters.  I sauted the onions, good Hungarian paprika and chicken in the Multi-Cooker, than added the other ingredients, closed the lid, and let it slow cook for five hours, until the chicken was falling off the bones. It was perfect, with no splatters, no stirring, no fuss.  It was more flavorful than making it in a pressure cooker, as well.So it has done everything I wanted with perfection.  It is meant to cook most items with the lid down, and no stirring is required.  Set it, walk away, and forget it.  Only when you brown or saut do you usually keep the lid up.  So anything that you want to slow cook or simmer, especially, is a dream in this appliance.There are numerous presets, but you can easily adjust any cooking time or temperature.A nice feature is that the outside gets warm but not burning hot.  There is a small steam vent, and when I used the boil/steam feature, steam comes out of that, so that is the one area you need to be cautious around.Still, there are things to consider.  This is a large appliance.  I havent measured it, but Amazon says it is 17 inches long.  Its big.  It does have a nice, big handle so you can easily pick it up and move it off the counter.Despite the large size, the cooking pot only holds a bit over four quarts.  That was plenty big for four huge chicken breasts with bones and four cups of liquid.  If I had needed to cook five chicken breasts, they would not have fit.The instruction page (its one giant sheet that needs to be folded like a road map) is not overly convenient.  It also is a bit confusing.  In more than one place, it says to refer to Steps 6 and 7 in the Preparing section (not quite the exact wording, but I dont have it in front of me).  I found a preparing section under the Rice instructions, but it only has six steps.  I guess number 7 refers to the bullet points under number 6.  Still, it is essentially a non-brainer to get this thing working.There is a recipe book with 16 recipes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34N1SK4506944/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9MTT6S#wasThisHelpful","R34N1SK4506944","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But you can take it anywhere (its rechargeable) and it has good sound.It can be set horizontal or vertical, and I have noticed a slight difference in sound, probably because of the small size.  Also, the surface it is set on can affect the sound more than a larger speaker.

"I really had never given any thought to parboiled rice before.  I didnt even know what it was.  I had to do a little research.  It turns out it is much more nutritious than regular white rice, almost as good as brown rice.  So if you like white rice, this is a much better choice.  It essentially is white rice that was processed in a way that retains nutrients that are lost with regular white rice.In addition, the grains stay separate, never sticky.  So it looks nice on the plate.As far as the taste, it tastes like white rice, so you can use it any recipe that calls for white rice, as long as you dont need sticky rice, and you will have the benefits of more nutrients.Good stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHHQNN88IYCUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BNQQHUW#wasThisHelpful","RHHQNN88IYCUG","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not yet read the earlier books by this writing team, but after reading Death of a Nightingale, I definitely intend to purchase them.Death of a Nightingale is a wonderfully constructed, smart suspense tale.  I read it in two evenings.  I had a hard time putting it down the first evening.  I was totally swept up in the story and the characters.  It totally kept me off guard, with surprise after surprise.  After about three-quarters of the book, I began to have suspicions about what was going on, but I could never have guessed at all the twists and turns.  It all comes together, and it all makes sense, unlike so many suspense books.The first fifty-or-so pages can seem a bit overwhelming, as there are a lot of characters, any of which have Danish or Russian or Ukrainian names.  It all quickly gets sorted out and the characters are very easy to keep straight, especially as the action, suspense and excitement build and build and never let up.In addition, we have real characters, not just names.The actions all make sense and follow smoothly.  There was never a time when I wanted to roll my eyes at coincidence, as I do in oh-so-many novels.  This one is clever and complex, and highly entertaining.I strongly recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0DA8C1Z0HPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616953047#wasThisHelpful","R2E0DA8C1Z0HPG","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am writing this review based on what this book is, not on what it is not.It is not a long, detailed biography of Richard II, his reign or his time.  For that matter, its not even a short biography of Richard II, his reign or his time.It does rather elegantly and robustly cover the main events in the dispute between Richard and the nobles, leading to the formation of the Lords Appellant and their downfall.  Earlier major events, such as the Peasants Revolt, are only briefly covered.  The book ends with the exile of Bolingbroke and Mowbray.The print length is described by Amazon as 78 pages, reflecting the narrow range of material covered.  What is covered, though, is told in a very entertaining and lively manner.  It was an enjoyable read, and I recommend it for anyone who has some knowledge of Richard II and wants to learn a bit more, or, someone like myself, who just wanted a quick refresher.  I especially enjoyed the authors (sometimes fanciful) discussion of the personalities involved.  His spotlight on Thomas of Woodstock was particularly interesting.It does not debate conflicting chronicles or theories.  The author does, in the afterword at the end, discuss some of the more controversial theories he advances and his sources and reasons for making them.  Otherwise, there are no footnotes or other direct sources cited.  So, again, if you are looking for a scholarly, microscopic investigation of the life and reign of Richard II, this isnt it.  If you do want to know why Richard II is considered by some historians to be one of the worst, if not the worst, ruler in English history, this small book will explain it to you in exciting prose.  I highly recommend it on that level.The title, many of you will know, is a paraphrase of the line from Shakespeare, ""Keeps Death his court.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U4QMOFVYM8EE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT5QVCA#wasThisHelpful","R2U4QMOFVYM8EE","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A beautifully crafted novel, full of marvelous, complex characters.  The author portrays a long-term political hostage situation in -- incredibly -- a lovely, warm and intimate tale of desperation and hope.  Everything about it is a surprise.  It is a joy to read.If you are not an opera fan (I am), don't be turned off by the connection.  An opera singer is central to the plot, as is the effect of her singing and her persona on the terrorists and captives, but you don't need to know anything more than she has a beautiful voice and sings beautiful songs.By the way, if anyone doubts the effect she can have just by walking into a room, I had an interesting experience. I was attending a special concert held in a cathedral.  At the last moment, with the entire audience seated but before the lights went down, a woman came walking down the entire length of the aisle to a seat held for her in the front row.  The whole audience gasped, oohed and awed.  There was something about her that just lit up the room.  People around me were asking, in breathless tones, who she was.  I recognized her immediately as a well-known opera singer.  As I read this book, I relived that moment over and over again, as the singer in this book has the same effect on people.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PHR968D0UQ7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC10S4#wasThisHelpful","R3PHR968D0UQ7A","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good quality, and arrived very quickly.  I'm new to using these as I usually do silk thread beading with bullion (French wire) at the ends.  I'm doing several necklaces now with wire instead of silk, and these guards work beautifully.  They are definitely easier than the bullion and more suitable for wire.

"This hat is way too flimsy for many purposes.  If you want it just to wear sitting on a patio or beach, it probably is wonderful.  If you want to actually wear it and move around, it is not so wonderful.I walk over three miles a day, to and from work, and I always want to have a wide-brim hat to limit my use of sunscreen.  I cannot tolerate any extended amount of sun exposure as my skin burns and Im left with dark splotches that take months to go away (with the help of a prescription cream).  This hat seemed perfect, especially since it has a chin strap to hold it in place.The chin strap does keep the hat on my head.  However, the slightest hint of a breeze causes the brim to flip and flop up and down, left and right, back and forth.  Without the chin strap, Im sure the hat would fly off with the softest breeze.Since the brim is directly on eye-level, it is constantly in my line of sight, and the never-ending jerking movement only inches from my eyes is very distracting.  I tend to constantly pay attention to the direction my hat brim is currently moving when I should be watching where I am walking.  Often, too, the movement of the brim leaves my face partially or completely exposed to the sun.I have never actually worn this hat when there is anything resembling a wind.  In fact, I check the weather first to make sure there is never any more than a breeze.  I assume with the constant movement I get from a breeze, a wind would make it useless.As far as being packable, what they mean is you can press it down flat.  You cannot roll it up.  There is a thin wire that goes around the brim and it is easily damaged and bent.  So to put it in a suitcase, its probably best to put it in first, so it is up against the flat side of the suitcase.In addition to this hat, I have several roll-up and packable wide-brim visors that I use.  They do not flap in the breeze, and they always protect my face, but they do not protect the top of my head or the back of my neck.  For that reason, I wanted this hat.  Unfortunately, I cannot deal with the dancing brim.I bought two of these hats on a lightning deal and had them delivered to my work address.  I immediately tossed the box in the trash.  Otherwise, I would have returned them once I saw how the brim moves.So, they may or may not work for you, depending on how you want to use them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22FWH04M7HZYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPCX7UO#wasThisHelpful","R22FWH04M7HZYJ","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive had a few of these through the years  this is my third.  Each one lasted several years.  I found that I really cant do without.I use this for summer clothes  gauzy dresses or silk items that I dont want to put in the washing machine, as well as quick wash-ups where I dont want to go put coins in the laundry machines (I live in a condo with a laundry room).  One of its best uses is for cashmere sweaters and scarves.  I wash them in the sink or tub and a few minutes in this spinner and they are almost dry.Note that it does not produce heat.  It simply spins clothes very, very fast and pulls all the water out.  You cant squeeze another drop out, no matter how hard you try.  So you can hang clothes up and never have anything dripping.  They will dry super fast on the hanger.The machine has a dial to set the time to spin.  Most items only need two minutes, but it goes up to four.  That is the only setting.Be careful to not overfill the tub.  If you do, a piece can spin up and down the insides.  Not good.  I let that happen once, but Ill never do it again.Be sure to remove the bottom screws before you use the machine.  Its got warnings all over it to do that, but I have a relative who ignored the warnings.  The screws are designed to hold moveable parts during shipping and then are to be discarded.  They, of course, prevent moveable parts from moving  not good to leave in place!My only complaint is the very short cord.  You need to have an electrical outlet near a sink or tub where the spinner can be set so it is flat and where the water can drain out.  I live in a very old condo with one electrical outlet in my bathroom.  The cord cannot reach the sink and just barely reaches the tub without an inch to spare.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R291B2XS48GTZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HT0958#wasThisHelpful","R291B2XS48GTZ9","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes I buy a book and put it aside, wondering why I bought it.  Every now and then, when I finally getting around to reading that book, Im doubly surprised and delighted to find its excellent.And what a surprise this was.  I really dont remember what prompted me to buy it.  But Im glad I did.  It is a wonderful look at Edward, the Black Prince, son of Edward III, his life and his times.  It is a fictional account, and Im sure it makes Edward out to be a better person than he was in real life.  Here he is charming, humble, thoughtful and well-meaning.  He is very likeable.  Even his father comes across as likeable, and thats not easy.  Not that they arent portrayed as warriors.  They are.  But they are not unreasonable.  The author does a terrific job.The book covers his youth and his training as a knight, as well as a few of his most famous battles.  We see both the lofty goals and the hypocrisy of knighthood.  The Earl responsible for his training emphasizes honesty and duty to the king and other knights, but he has no qualms about cheating townspeople and robbing a young runaway couple of everything they own.  Later, we see those lessons in war as they pillage and burn crops and entire villages in France to draw out and deprive the French king and lords, with no regard for the innocent victims.Edwards ferocious temper (from which he most likely got his nickname) is only shown in battle.  Oddly, I understand that some modern historians are now claiming Edward wasnt quite the bloodthirsty, ferocious warrior depicted earlier, and that he only slaughtered hundreds instead of thousands of innocent victims.This is not a romance novel, but we do have the recurring appearance of Joan of Kent, Edwards eventual bride.  She herself is a fascinating character.  I wish English contemporary historians had paid a little more attention to women, and we knew more about her intriguing life story.  She had to be very remarkable.All in all, this book is very interesting, very well written, and kept my attention throughout.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys exciting historical fiction and the glamor and drama of the Plantagenets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T8HCO7ZEIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC1GVGQ#wasThisHelpful","R1T8HCO7ZEIK","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was fascinated by the idea of someone writing a fictional tale of Cleopatra VII from the viewpoint of her relationship with her sisters, Berenice and Arsinoe, especially as these sisters have been ill-used by history.  The concept sounded very interesting.  Well, parts of it were interesting, parts of it werent interesting, and parts of it were . . . really weird.First of all, Cleopatra herself does not appear in this book.  It appears that the author intends this to be the first volume in the currently trendy trilogy (or maybe worse) scheme.  The problem with trilogies, especially in dealing with the unknown, is that the author is forced to fill up page after page with fluff -- things that would never make it into a single-volume effort.  In this book, to say some of the fiction reaches past fluff directly into the absurd would be an understatement.  Its essentially a soap opera.The book begins with the king, Ptolemy XII, and his daughter Cleopatra having fled the country.  There is little historical context given as to how or why this happened (and we really dont know if Cleopatra accompanied him or not).  The book has Berenice IV somehow becoming queen, and the implication is either that she overthrew the king (her father) or he simply ran off and she filled the vacuum he left.  Neither, of course, is quite true, but the historical records are very confusing as to exactly what happened and who took over (one of the various women named Cleopatra Tryphaena is most likely, followed by Berenice, or maybe the two together), so I can live with the simplification presented.I did not like, however, how Cleopatra Tryphaena (here presented as Berenices mother) was turned into a two-dimensional monster.  It smacked of hack female writing (I dont know why so many bad women writers have to turn so many of their female characters into two-dimensional, evil shrews with no redeeming qualities  her C.T. is positively mentally unbalanced).  And again and again the author has various characters making comments about useless females.  It was very irritating and repetitious.  Why do female authors do that?  Keep in mind that there were some very important queens shortly before the time period discussed.Im also not sure why she felt the need to turn Cleopatras mother into a concubine, who is also vilified.  The historical record, or what little remains of it, did not preserve the name of Cleopatra VIIs mother (relatively few female names do come down through the millennia), but the one thing we can state is that there is nothing out of the ordinary about Cleopatras lineage.  The contemporary Romans sought to discredit and disparage Cleopatra in every way imaginable, but they never, ever implied that she was not of royal birth.  Trust me, if there had been the slightest rumor about her mother not being a queen, the Romans would have played it up without mercy.  Look at how they attacked Ptolemy XII (her father) for playing the flute!Unfortunately, once Berenice becomes ruler, the author has no idea what to do with her.  Theres a lot of muttering about Cyprus (again with no historical reference), but other than that, the author cant think of anything better for Berenice to do than go husband hunting.  Once again, I had to think of an old-fashioned soap opera.Still, I liked Berenice very much and thought her chapters were interesting, although too limited.  However, her chapters alternate with those of her younger sister, Arsinoe.  I would rather the author had concentrated on Berenice and forgotten Arsinoe.We know nothing about the real Arsinoes childhood.  We dont even know how old she was in relation to Berenice and Cleopatra.  The author has made her a child, about to turn nine years old at the beginning of the story.  Its as good a theory as any of the others.  The rest of Arsinoes story, as covered in this book, is completely fictionalized and shockingly bad.  I dont want to give away any spoilers, but, oh, my gosh, why?  Apparently, the author felt a need to invent some rather unique and bizarre experiences to set up Arsinoes later actions (not covered in this book).I was also very annoyed by the writing.  The author wants you to remember that the ultimate goal will be to cover Cleopatras life.  So she has Arsinoe, on page after page, thinking of Cleopatra, wishing Cleopatra were there, remembering something Cleopatra said, wondering what Cleopatra would do.  Over and over and over again.  The repetition just about drove me mad.  Too, I would hate to count the number of (way too many) times that Ganymedes calls Arsinoe, my dear, but I started to cringe each and every time.  At least it made me remember which secondary character he was.  I couldnt keep the others straight, as they were so interchangeable.  I hated Ganymedes; unfortunately, he will be an important person in later events, so hes bound to return in future volumes.Other than that, the writing tends to the florid and melodramatic.  There are so many over-the-top phrases and expressions in this book that made me either gag, groan or laugh out loud.  I almost stopped reading the book after about thirty pages as I didnt think I could get past the description of Arsinoe eating a grape.  Its that bad.  After a while, I got used to it, though, and seldom gasped out loud at the bad writing.  I say seldom, not never.If I, for any reason, had to read this book over again (that reason involving nothing less than a loaded pistol held to my temple), I would entirely skip the Arsinoe chapters and only read the Berenice chapters.For those interested in an excellent fictional life of Cleopatra, try Margaret Georges, The Memoirs of Cleopatra.  It is well written and follows the historical record.  Its a beautiful book.  For some factual information on interesting earlier Ptolemaic queens, try Arsinoe of Egypt and Macedon (about Arsinoe II) by Elizabeth Donnelly Carney and Berenice II and the Golden Age of Ptolemaic Egypt by Dee L. Clayman.  I also found The Crown of Arsinoe II: The Creation of an Image of Authority by Maria Nilsson, interesting.  Dont, however, confuse the earlier Arsinoe II or Berenice II with the Arsinoe and Berenice in this book.So how to rate this book?  The writing is two-star.  Its drifts way too often into really, really over-the-top ostentatious and pretentious melodrama.  (I have an advanced reader copy and am not allowed to quote, but I sure wish I could  there are some howlers in this book.  By the way, its also possible that some of it may change for the better before the books publication.  We can only hope.)  The Arsinoe chapters, especially the later ones, are preposterous, also earning a two-star rating.  But I really, really liked Berenice, even though her character and sphere of influence were so limited by the authors imagination.  I would give the Berenice chapters four stars.  So about two-and-a-half stars overall.  I tend to be generous, and I do appreciate the authors efforts on behalf of Berenice, so maybe I will give this three stars, but I could just as easily go with two.  Needless to say, I have no desire to read the forthcoming volumes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XD9OI3UNGEMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316382981#wasThisHelpful","R2XD9OI3UNGEMF","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really couldnt tell these were partly recycled cotton.  Its a great idea.  All those old t-shirts and things have to go somewhere, why not make them useful.The towels are quite soft and absorbent, although I was not crazy about the tight area near the edge  Im sure there is a name for that section, sort of like a waffle weave.  (I wish I could point.)  Its a bit rough.I got the white towel set and washed them, as usual, before using.  I live in a condo and use a laundry room, so I cannot speak to the amount of lint left behind in the lint filter.  However, I did notice white lint in my bathroom when using the towels.  In fact, I have a mesh strainer in the drain and it clogged up with a fine layer of lint.  Maybe the towels need to be washed twice to remove lint before using.I do not use any sort of fabric softener or any dryer sheets as I do not like the smells and also dryer sheets cut down on absorbency for towels as they leave a coating.  That kind of defeats the purpose.The bath towel is huge; in fact, Im short and it and it trails on the ground if I dont pay attention.  I dont generally use wash cloths, so I cant speak to that.  I do like the mat.  It is the sort of mat you put down on the floor for stepping onto after bathing, and then it is lightweight enough to throw into the washing machine with the towels.  Its not the sort of mat you would leave on the floor all the time as it will move around.All in all, a pretty good set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB80SGFXYP75V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSIFEWK#wasThisHelpful","RB80SGFXYP75V","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, I am a cynic.  I never believed this stuff would work.  I honestly and truly saw a difference in two days.  There are no miracles here so far  I drink tea and cola all day long, both of which stain teeth yellow, but it definitely and noticeably began removing yellow in the first few uses.  I was astonished.  My teeth arent sparkling white, but I havent finished the total program yet, still have more than half a tube left, so I will update this later when I see the final results, but I just wanted to say it absolutely and quickly makes an obvious difference.  Can it totally remove many, many years of tea and cola stain?  Probably not, but I never expected it to.  I just wanted not to be so sunshine yellow, and it definitely has had an impact.I have very sensitive teeth, and it has not been painful.  Oddly, it hardly bothers my gums at all.  After a few uses, it did start to make my tongue and lips just a bit numb and tingly, but the sensation does not last long.  All I do then is skip a session or even a day, so it does not become an issue.The taste is not bad.  If you have ever had a sore in your mouth where you had to rinse your mouth with a hydrogen peroxide solution, it is a similar taste.  Not yummy, but easily tolerable.Also, my teeth feel very clean and smooth, almost like I just had a professional cleaning.  Nice.My teeth were very dark and very yellow because of all the cola and tea I drink all day long.  I had not used any whitening products in many years.  I had my teeth professionally whitened years ago, and it was a waste of money as it simply didnt work.  It also caused extreme sensitivity and outright pain.  It totally turned me off the idea of trying whitening again, but, I started thinking there must have been some advancements in whitening since then, but I didnt want to pay a lot to try one.  Using this Crest gel system was completely different and so much easier and less painful.  And it cost hundreds of dollars less than for the professional treatment.The Crest system was not only relatively cheap, but I could do it at home.  It was easy, virtually painless, and I got almost immediate results.  Very pleased.

"As a general rule, I dont like to use any styling products or anything else that stays on my hair.  I have had long hair most of my life and still do; they eventually will bury me with long hair.  However, as the years have passed by, my hair now can get a bit frizzy at the ends; also when I tie it back, I wind up with little fluffy flying frizzies sticking out on the sides around my face.

Many of the reviews I read when the movie was in theaters made it seem too depressing.  It's not, really.

"This is a very enjoyable version of Mark Twain's book.  As of this writing, the only version available is the 94-minute version, which was cut from the original broadcast length.  This is bad news for us Guy Williams fans, as I believe a subplot about his character's background has been removed.  His role is fairly minimal in what remains of the film.  I hope one day we can again see the entire film.Still, the title refers to the ""prince and the pauper,"" and those characters are great fun.  The young actor does quite well, and the deception of one boy playing two parts is handled gracefully.This is a good film for the entire family to enoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FL19440221ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IY1J9G8#wasThisHelpful","R3FL19440221ZZ","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not quite as good as the very best Hungarian kolbasz, but still very enjoyable.  Nice flavor and texture.  It may have a bit too much salt for some people, but I liked it.My favorite thing, from childhood, is to cut it in relatively small pieces and fry them until they start to brown a bit on the cut sides.  Then take them out of the pan and throw in some scrambled eggs.  The eggs pick up the flavor and make a wonderful meal with the sausage.I should add that there was very little grease in the pan after I fried the pieces.I would buy this again.  As I said, I have had better, but I no longer have a convenient source for great kolbasz.  This is very good kolbasz, and I can appreciate it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQK175OAHIMTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LRIJIM#wasThisHelpful","RQK175OAHIMTC","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just about anything you want in a vacuum is right there in the box.  What cant you do with it?  Its an upright, a canister, and a lift away all in one, and its quite easy to switch between modes as needed.  Its even pretty -- shiny, colorful and really snazzy looking -- and I never thought I would say that about a vacuum cleaner.  The particular configuration I received contained about every attachment I could ever want, from cleaning hard wood floors to deep pile carpets, dusting, etc.  Everything works as I hoped.  I especially like the dusting attachment.  I could not really test the pet hair tool as I am currently in a sorrowful petless state, so I can only say I hope it works when I do move in another year or two and officially become Crazy Cat Lady Supreme.So whats not to love?  Well, storage.  Good golly, Miss Molly, this thing is huge.  It is a very tall vacuum cleaner in its upright position, a whopping 46 inches.  The top of the handle stands six inches above my old vacuum, which looks like a weakling midget compared to the Shark.  Two problems there  one, I am very short (52) and the handle comes up to my armpit (although, of course,  I don't vacuum with it fully upright), and, two, I stored my old vacuum in a small cupboard (I live in a big-city apartment where space is at a serious premium) and this one will not fit in the cupboard because of the height.  Not a catastrophe as this vacuum easily breaks down into its parts, its just that I would like to have it ready to go at the drop of a hat (or whatever else someone spilled) without fussing.  Also, with all the parts, you need room, lots of room.  The converter attachment to make this a canister is very bulky if you dont attach it, and it makes the horizontal size issue more profound if you do have it attached.  Also, the vacuum has two bottoms, one for carpet and one for hard wood.  Plus attachments.  Ill admit to getting this thing all put together and saying, yikes, where can I put it all?  I cant vacuum all the time, although I certainly should vacuum more often than I do.By the way, the lift away mode is great.  Not too heavy.  You can get anywhere.  I feel foolish having wasted a ton of money on a Dyson cordless that runs for max of 20 minutes (I wish I had known that before I paid $$$$ for it) and this will most likely replace that.  Only problem is the cord.  I do hate vacuums with cords, but, really, unless you are doing a quick spot clean, you need power over a period of time, and my cordless Dyson fails miserably.  Oh, and this Shark does not have a retractable cord.  Next model, they need to add that, if they can figure out how to do it with the lift away.  Cords are always a nuisance.  There is a sizeable hook on the Shark to wrap the cord around, but Id rather have the cord out of sight when Im not using it and partially retracted when I just need a short cord.So, yes, it is about the coolest vacuum ever.  Just make sure youve got closet space to store it and you dont mind the cord not retracting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39MCW0NGV3F70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7R1FZ2#wasThisHelpful","R39MCW0NGV3F70","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved Wolf Hall.  I assume most people thinking of purchasing Bring Up the Bodies have also read Wolf Hall.  With a sequel, you always wonder if it will be as good.  You seldom expect it to be better.  Prepare to be surprised.  This book is wonderful.

"I have a fairly good quality, large monitor at work, and I really wanted a good monitor at home for editing videos and photos.  Here it is.  Quite spectacular.  What can I say?  Its precalibrated and the colors pop.  The resolution and refresh and terrific.  The screen size is nice and big but easily viewable as a whole.Before you buy it, there are a few considerations (other than the price  you really have to want this and not a cheapo small monitor).  The base is huge.  This is great because it protects your investment and keeps it steady and safe.  But you need serious desk/table space for it.  Also, make sure you have a graphics card that will display full resolution or it is a waste.  I intended to use it with several different computers, and I was shocked to find my newest computer did not have a graphics card that would display maximum resolution.  It wasnt something I even considered when I purchased the computer.Ill mention one other thing, not the fault of the monitor, but something you might want to know.  I was excited that it has an input to view a tablet screen.  Terrific.  I have a Kindle.  How nice it would be to pull up a Prime Instant Video on the Kindle and watch it on the big screen.  Well, no.

"Hmm.  Arent these supposed to be satisfying and eliminate cravings?  Didnt work for me.  I ate one of these bars one afternoon when I really just wanted something crunchy.  Twenty minutes later, I had a strong craving for chocolate.  Sadly, I have no will power.  When chocolate calls my name, I must answer and obey without question.I think the problem with this is that there is just a dab of chocolate here and there.  It seemed to plant the idea of chocolate, more chocolate, chocolate now.  I think it should have a bit more chocolate and less salt.  A few bites were salty; the saltiness was not overall.

"I liked the concept and the flavor of this drink mix.  Its very handy to carry around, and it doesnt leak under any normal circumstances.  It has a nice flavor and is refreshing.To open the bottle, you have to pull a tab away from the side of the top.  Then the top flips up.  Oh, no, I thought, its going to leak.  No.  You then have to give the bottle a good squeeze to get the diaphragm (if that is the right word) to open and release the liquid.  So go ahead and put it in a purse or tote bag.Just squirt some in your water and stir.  You do have to stir.  The concentrate is heavier than the water and sinks down.  It is pre-sweetened.So I tried the Liquid Iced Black Tea Mix in the Lemon flavor.  It is described on the bottle as lemon flavor with other natural flavor.  The other natural flavors include honey and there is also carrot juice for color.I tasted more honey than either tea or lemon.  In fact, I wasnt all that sure I tasted lemon at all.  Im not sure if I am tasting the carrot juice or what else, but this is really not a pure tea with lemon flavor.  I prefer my iced tea with lots of lemon and other sweeteners other than honey.So all in all, a very nice, convenient and pleasant flavor, but for my preference, too much honey and not enough lemon for those times when I really want iced tea with lemon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R290GAA661JI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SK4VNV8#wasThisHelpful","R290GAA661JI4","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to like this book more than I actually did.  The real Mazie must have been an incredible person.  This fictionalized account is part hit and part miss.  It tells Mazies story through numerous sources  in fact, a few too numerous for my taste.  Most of this story is told in the form of entries in Mazies diary, started when she was a child, with excerpts from Mazies unpublished autobiography and interviews with people who knew Mazie directly or indirectly.The real-life Mazie was famous for helping bums and drunks during the Depression, but that part of her life comes very late in the book.  Until then, we keep hearing what a colorful character she was, a real good-time gal, living during a tumultuous time in world history:  the first World War, the Jazz Age, Prohibition, the Depression.  Unfortunately, when it comes to Mazie, there is too much saying and too little showing or doing.  I was expecting a free spirit, a Jazz Baby, a flapper.  No.  Shes a snooze.She seems to spend most of her adult life working and drinking -- stagnating.  Shes stuck, at an early age, in a dead-end job, living with her sister and her sisters husband; sitting in a ticket booth (her cage) all day long at his theater.  She complains about life passing her by, but she never does anything about it.  This at a time when women have achieved the vote and are out in the work force, driving cars, experimenting with life.  I kept wondering why she didnt just leave or at least get a different job.  I never felt I knew her or understood her, and I did not find her very interesting or likeable  or colorful -- and I couldnt figure out why everyone in the book keeps saying how wonderful she was.The secondary characters, however, are wonderful.  I was so intrigued by Rudy, the theater manager; the Captain, Mazies long-time, but occasional, love; Mazies younger sister, Jeannie, the two Flicker men; and Lou, the husband of Mazies older sister.  These are great characters.  Oddly enough, the men are so very much more interesting than the women.  Only for a moment here or there does a woman seem to have a thought in her head.  For instance, Mazie observes the consequences of war, political bombings, union fights, Prohibition, and so on, but seldom seems to have an opinion.I was also a little put off by Mazies constant desire to help men during the Depression.  I cannot just fault the author here.  We constantly hear about men in bread lines, men looking for work, men sleeping on park benches, men bumming money so they can get drunk and forget their problems.  And why are these the people Mazie helps?  What happened to city women during the Depression?  Did they just evaporate?  Temporarily move to another planet?  Where were they?  Who cared about them?  They dont seem to have entered Mazies or the authors consciousness.So, all in all, I liked many parts of the book, but I was less than thrilled with the main character.  The book is interesting for its view on life in New York during an incredible time period and for its secondary characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA73FSP6QV628/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455599891#wasThisHelpful","RA73FSP6QV628","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the class Crocs clog.  My feet swell in hot, humid weather, and these are the only shoes I can tolerate.  I also walk several miles a day to and from work, and these are the best.I buy wear a size six-and-a-half, and I order the Crocs in size seven to give my feet room to swell.  In cooler weather, I wear socks; hot weather, no socks.  Also, putting the strap on the back of my heel holds them on when my feet arent swelling.  When they swell, I push the strap up to the top of the shoe.They provide excellent arch support.  I have very high arches and a very high instep and I am very comfortable in these shoes.The main drawback is that if it is raining and you walk into a store with smooth floors, swoosh, slip, slide.  You have to be very careful.  Usually, there is a mat to wipe your shoes at the entrance.  Use it.Also, I have a friend with MS who tells me these shoes do not provide enough lateral support, so if you are unfortunate enough to share that need, these shoes are not sufficient.  For everyone else, they are terrific, very, very comfortable.You can wash your Crocs, best to use a damp cloth, but you can put them in the sink if they get filthy.  Most of the time, an occasional swipe along the inside with damp cloth or paper towel is all you need to prevent them picking up odors.  If they start to squeak, put some vegetable oil on them overnight and then wipe them off in the morning with a paper towel.If they are too big, put them in the dryer with a damp towel for a few minutes.  If they are too small, do the same, but take them out and put them on and walk around in them to stretch them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ75H5WAQQCWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014BYHA8#wasThisHelpful","RZ75H5WAQQCWZ","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this fan at a dirt-cheap price on Amazon to replace a much more expensive fan.  This fan is comparable and much cheaper, and I am very happy with it and plan to buy another.The Honeywell has one drawback, and that is the knob to turn the unit on or change the speed.  It is very small and slightly difficult to reach and turn.  I can handle it, but I know my mother, who had bad arthritis in her hands, could never have managed it.  So that might be a consideration.All of this deep-style fans are hard to clean.  My older, more expensive fan started making weird noises, and its possible it could be fixed by a good cleaning, as the motor and blades are covered in filth, but its hard to reach in to clean because of the depth.  I see the same problem happening with the Honeywell.It is not very noisy.  I dont think it is loud enough for a white noise machine unless you turn it up to high.

"You really cant go wrong with Polk speakers, and these are a good value for the price.  They are about 10 inches tall and very heavy and sturdy, being of solid wood.  The sound is good and clean.  They are nice for a small to midsize room.You do need to buy speaker wires.  As usual, they do not come in the box.And, of course, you need a music source as these are only speakers.  There are no controls, no power source, no on/off switch.  All that is handled through the source.  I am using mine with a Denon PMA-50 amplifier.By the way, these do come two to a box, so the price is for the pair.  I actually went to a brick and mortar store to buy these, wanting to hear the sound.  The salesperson tried to sell me two boxes of speakers, insisting the price was for a single speaker and that only one was in each box.  I decided to leave and check online, as that did not sound right.  Sure enough, two to a box, one price, and if I had listened to the sales guy, I would have gotten home and found I had four speakers.

I have no way of testing that, being a consumer, but I have to say that so far I have been very happy with their performance.  I've used them in a few products that eat up batteries, and they do seem to last and last.I like that they are guaranteed in storage for ten years.

"This is a beautifully written and engrossing story, very well done . . . that is, until the end.  Oh, the ending.This book is disturbing, heartbreaking  not a fun read  but one I couldnt put down.  We meet two women in India, each in very different economic and social situations, but both suffering from a lack of power and control in their lives.  One appears to have it all, the other appears to have nothing.  Both have been through very hard times, and there are more bad times to come.  They have been friends for many, many years, but one is the others lowly servant.  In common they have their survival instincts, their resiliency, and their friendship.  They will have choices to make, but in the end, really, they have no choice.  Each must continue to be who she has been all along.This is a shocking and painful story, very sincere, very real.  It is impossible not to care for and care about these two women.  I very highly recommend it, but I must warn in advance that the ending is unsatisfying and unrealistic.  Still worth reading?  Yes, emphatically, yes.  The fact is, I dont know how else to end the book.  Peoples stories dont end as long as they are living, so perhaps the book really shouldnt have an ending either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WQU3OK6432NI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006079156X#wasThisHelpful","R2WQU3OK6432NI","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How nice to see this old (1958) movie available again!  I saw it ages ago and never forgot it.  Ive looked for it on DVD for years.This movie is quite typical of the sort of entertainment Disney made in the 1950s, along the line of Davy Crockett and Zorro (the Guy Williams TV show).  It is an intimate movie, easy to be viewed by a family watching on a small screen.  There is a good effort into having the setting, language, costumes and props be authentic.  It doesnt look cheap, but its not some big, loud special-effects movie.  It resolves its issues of identity, trust and belonging quite quickly and simply.  It is sincere and heartwarming, and it can be enjoyed by anyone of any age.A very young James MacArthur plays Johnny, a teenage boy who was adopted by a Delaware Indian chief, and known in the village as True Son.  The British seek a treaty with the Delaware, part of which requires them to return all white captives.  In return, the army will keep white settlers out of the Indian territory.  (All this takes place in 1764, between the French and Indian Wars and the American Revolution.)  True Son regards himself as a true Indian and does not want to leave his tribe, but his father insists he abide by the treaty.  True Son dislikes the whites, especially because of a group of whites, known as the Paxton Boys, recently slaughtered a group of Indian women, children, and old men.  This, unfortunately, was a real event.  True Son learns that he will be living among the Paxton Boys.  One in particular, played by Wendell Corey, is quite the villain.True Son is aided in his transition by an army scout named Del Hardy, played by the ever-charismatic Fess Parker.  Del Hardy had lived with the Indians as a child, and understands True Sons nature.  True Sons white mother is played by Jessica Tandy.  She has a relatively small role, and at first seems strict and unyielding, but apparently she is simply as uncomfortable as is True Son  now known as Johnny  at their reunion.Johnny makes one other friend, the Wendell Corey characters indentured servant, played by Carol Lynley.  It would have been easy to predict the impact she would have in later screen appearances.  Shes very good and very likeable as an innocent young girl in a bad situation.True Son/Johnny is torn back and forth, but, of course, we know what will happen in the end.  The Indians are treated with respect, and the bad guys learn their lesson.  Its all very comforting and enjoyable, except for one truly embarrassing character.  Poor Joanne Dru is forced to portray a man-hungry, desperate husband-hunter, and her character is so two-dimensional and forced that her scenes are painfully awkward.  After a days filming, Im sure her face hurt from being stuck in that eager, simpleton grin.  I cringed through each of her scenes.I purchased the only copy of this movie I have ever found on DVD, and it is the classroom edition.  It includes some suggested activities for teachers.  There are also additional learning aides on the DVD, but they must be accessed on a computer.  I did not check those out.I highly recommend this very pleasant movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FGILR1NJP6CD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XOHZ4A#wasThisHelpful","R2FGILR1NJP6CD","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very happy with these bins.  I have had them up on the tiles around my bathtub/shower for well over a week now, and they are staying in place, tight and secure.  Each is holding several bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.  One is set up as a corner shelf, against two walls.  The other is set at the edge, with the bin only touching one wall.I followed the instructions for attaching to shiny tiles:  For each one, I first thoroughly cleaned the tiles and let them dry.  Then I measured where I wanted to put them, making sure I had the spots for the two holders level.  Then all I had to do was peel the backing off the holders and place them on the wall.  I double-checked to make sure they were even and level, then slid the bin onto the holders.  Each bin has two parallel bars at the top a short distance from each other for that purpose and the holders fit between the two bars.  Thats it.The holders are flat and tight against the wall and have not budged since I put them up.I used two holders for each bin, so for the bin where only one side is against a wall, I had two side-by-side holders.  I was worried that that bin might not hold up, but so far, it is just as tight against the wall as when I first put it up.If you do not have a shiny surface to adhere the holders, the package comes with adapters.  Those would be applied to the dull surface and then the regular holders attached to them.  I did not use and cannot further comment on them.I did notice one small issue, and that is why I am giving these four stars and not five.  When I went to slide one of the bins into place, I noticed that the two bars were not quite in line.  One protruded slightly.  In other words, both bars would not set flush against the wall.  It was a very small, but noticeable, difference, and I thought it might affect the shelfs staying power.  However, in this case, it did not bother me, as I was using this particular bin at the side of the wall, not in a corner, so only one side had to be flush against the wall.Update:I have now had these on the wall for several months, and they are holding steady.

"A beautiful and affecting novel, with sincere and real characters.  This book affected me deeply.  It chronicles the after effects of the death of a young girl, but it truly is about the entire family and a way of life.  Each of the main characters is fully drawn, with a personality, a history, faults and fine points -- they don't just appear for the sake of the deceased needing a mother or a father or a sister or whatever, as in so many lesser novels.  They have reasons for doing what they do, saying what they say.  The town they live in also is portrayed so that I could really imagine living there.  We see neighbors, co-workers, store owners, and church ladies as real people, some likeable, some not so much.  And the mine!  Believe me, I felt the dangers of working in a coal mine, especially for the young children.I have to say that many years ago, a young girl in my family died in a similar manner, although in her case, it was done purposely by some boys for fun, and I know how it affected the girl's mother, especially.  This happened before I was born, but my mother was present and told me about it many times.  The girl's mother was taunted and harrassed by the boys (who, of course were never punished, just ""boys being boys"") for months afterwards, and she slowly lost her grip on reality and finally killed herself.  I found myself, as I was reading this book, picturing her facing her Grief.  It was heartbreaking.This is a beautifully written book with unforgettable characters, and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32O5XF4QON2A0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HK480UQ#wasThisHelpful","R32O5XF4QON2A0","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Isn't this the cutest thing?  Okay, I'm officially a grown-up but that doesn't mean I can't have fun.  I got this apron is for me.  It could be for anyone who loves Frozen -- isn't that just about everyone?  It's just about a one-size-fits-all as the ""ties"" are really one very long piece.  That means you can adjust the neck area and pull it up or lower, as you please, and I really like that feature.  Then the ties around the waist are very, very long.  A smaller person can wrap them around twice, but a plus-size adult will still easily be able to fasten it.The one thing I would add is a large pocket or two.  This is the only apron I own that doesn't have pockets, and they are so convenient for a paper towel or holding a spoon or a spice jar until you need it.  I really miss not having a pocket.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PRDYIW4U7QEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V2TT62G#wasThisHelpful","R1PRDYIW4U7QEW","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had others of these electronic callus remover devices before, and I have to say, the Silk'n is the best one Ive used.  It is the fastest and gave me the best results.I walk several miles a day, and my feet show it, especially the dreadfully dry and cracked skin on my heels.I was able to get very good results with one try with this device.  Granted, my feet at this point (early May) arent as bad as they will be during the summer, but still, to be able to get them smooth with initial use is really amazing.Be sure to put a lotion on your feet afterwards.  I use either Badger foot balm or Vaseline Intensive Repair lotion.  I use the device once a week and put the balm or lotion on my heels every night before I go to bed.This device comes with two batteries, but I would recommend getting some rechargeable batteries when they wear out.It comes with two rollers, a coarse and a fine.  I usually just use the coarse.  It does not hurt at all, but dont use it more than a few seconds in any spot as it will take off skin and you dont want to go deep.According to the manual, the rollers should last about a year.  That is my only concern.  My other devices came with extra replacement rollers, and they did not last a year.  Its impossible for me to say at this point how long the rollers on the Silk'n device will last.  Not only does it not come with any replacement rollers, but you actually need to replace the entire top part  the rollers themselves are not removable.  Instead, the entire head removes (as you would do to switch between the coarse and the fine) and so the entire head must be replaced, not just the rollers.  I could not find any replacement heads for sale, so I assume that essentially, this is a toss-after-a-year product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28Q59UZ1SBTLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0GBRL6#wasThisHelpful","R28Q59UZ1SBTLY","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very tasty.The recipe:  Purchase one pound of ground meat of your choice, brown the meat, add some water and the seasoning pack.  Heat up (microwave or oven) the hard or soft tacos (it comes with six of each), fill them, add some of the sauce.  Thats it.  Easy.I lined the tacos with sour cream, spooned in the meat, and added a lot of the sauce and some cheese.  I thought the seasoning was a little bland until I added the sauce  it made the tacos very yummy.The sauce is mild, not a hot, spicy mix.  If you want heat, you will need to add it yourself.  I dont, so I was quite happy with the results right out of the box.My hard tacos were intact, no breakage.I had lots of left overs, and warmed the meat up the next day, adding a few drops of water and then putting the bowl in the microwave.My only concern is about the hard taco shells  I found them a little on the thin side, not very substantial.  (The soft tacos were good.)  Other than that, this is a very handy kit and makes good-tasting food, fast and easy.I would buy this again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGHFVN3I9TBLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032GQMWO#wasThisHelpful","RGHFVN3I9TBLB","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book, published in 1989, is based on Sheila Whales 1986 doctoral thesis.  The subtitle is A Study of the Representation of the Family in Private Tombs.  It is, in fact, a look at a select group of 93 Eighteenth Dynasty private tombs that contain significant representations of family, along with an analysis of which family members are shown and how and when and where they are shown.  Theban tombs, for obvious reasons, predominate in the study.  However, the 93 tombs only date through the reign of Thutmose IV, so a large part of the dynasty is not included in the study.The first part of the book covers the tombs one by one, including a plan of each tomb from Porter Moss.  The second part presents an assessment of the relationships.  There are also some line drawings at the end.Names and titles are given in their transliterated form, not in a modern translation into English, so this may be a difficult book for beginners.This is a small book, roughly 8x6 inches in size.  Including the bibliography and index, it is just over 300 pages.For some reason, every now and then a book on ancient Egypt will go out of print and people will inexplicably begin charging outrageous prices for the book.  This book has been listed online and on Amazon for hundreds of dollars.  There are no color pictures or anything to justify that price.  The contents are  available for free online.  I, however, prefer hard copies of scholarly books, and I was able to pick this one up for fifty dollars at a local bookstore, and it was well worth the price.  However, if you are thinking of buying this book for an enormous price, save your money and put it toward a book that does not show as well on a computer screen as on paper, such as any of the Nina de Garis Davies or Amice Calverley volumes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VDNJ9KHK9QR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0858376709#wasThisHelpful","R1VDNJ9KHK9QR2","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is your life not perfect?  Maybe lost your job?  Or just not earning enough?  Bills, bills, bills.  It never ends.  Oh, to be rich.Well, be envious no longer.  This very entertaining book by Richard Kirshenbaum will enlighten you.  How little did I suspect that the rich suffer agonies daily.  First of all, those who have less than 100 million dollars (yes, thats a millionaire 100 times over) arent even considered rich any more and simply, as Rodney Dangerfield once famously said, dont get no respect by those in the 1 percent (those with 100 million or more).This is a very amusing book.  Its a light read, good for long airline flights, lunch breaks, or evenings when you just cant deal with anything heavy or too serious.  Its written in a very entertaining style, with short chapters, so you can pick it up and put it down whenever you want without having to worry about forgetting the plot.For what it is, its a cheery and bright little book.  Its not mean, vicious or overly snarky.  It wont hurt anyone to read it, and Im sure it will put a smile on your face at some point or another, and it will probably make you laugh or groan out loud at least once or twice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TYN9L8157I8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1504007328#wasThisHelpful","R3TYN9L8157I8R","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As far as moisturizing, I did not see any particular benefit to mark it as better than other moisturizing conditioners.My hair is blonde and hip-length, so moisture, especially on the ends, is a big issue.I did not like the smell of the conditioner as it comes out of the tube.  However, the smell does not linger once my hair is dry.  One night I made the mistake of going to bed before my hair was completely dry, while it still had an odor, and the smell got on my pillowcase.  I was able to smell it all night long.

"This is a very grim book told in a humorous manner.  Boo is a 13-year-old boy, short and slight, with pale skin, bullied for being an albino, although he is not.  Boo, of course, is a cruel nickname bestowed on him by other kids.  Hes also very different from typical teens in other ways.  Can you imagine a kid who received an abacus for this fifth birthday?  No, neither can I.  You wont be surprised to find Boo has no friends.One other thing about Boo  he was shot and killed at school while reciting the table of elements.He finds himself in an afterlife populated by other 13-year-old kids.  He narrates the book in the form of letters to his parents, his only close social connection.  Things are different there; hes not as smart, but he is more sociable.  And the afterlife is every bit as complicated as real life, especially after Johnny, another boy who died, apparently in the same shooting, appears and wants revenge.Youll laugh at some of Boos observations, but deep down, there is a lot of pain in this book. Teenagers are never angels and high school is not heaven.This is a good book for teens and for adults.  In fact, I think it should be required reading for parents, followed by serious conversations with their kids.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Q3FN0736H6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417136X#wasThisHelpful","R22Q3FN0736H6D","A32DYU82G6X3AO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32DYU82G6X3AO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very nice pins for special uses.  Obviously, they are horribly overpriced, so not something you would use as a typical safety pin.  They are also lightweight, but sharp.They are best suited for use on hanging tags, perhaps jewelry for sale.  I use them to attach fiber labels to chemo caps that I donate to charity.  Just a little something pretty to add a bit of interest and make them look special.They are coil-free, meaning they do not have the extra turn at the past as in typical safety pins, so they do not snag and catch on fabric.This set, with the multiple colors is very nice.

"Mystic is the first book by Jason Denzel, better known in fandom circles as the founder of The Wheel of Time fan site Dragonmount.  Mystic is the story Pomella, a teenage girl who fights with her father and dreams of something more, who is chosenagainst all tradition, as a commonerto endure trials in the hope of becoming apprentice to the High Mystic.  In doing so she will learn to manipulate the Myst.  And, less obviously, it is the story of Sim, the village friend who gets caught up in the events of the book.  It is, alas, a rather pedestrian debut.As you might expect of a book that revolves around trials to enter a magic apprenticeship, Mystic straddles the border of adult and YA fantasy.  It gently tries to push back against YA fantasy tropes in particular.  Not with any real success, but it is certainly in conversation with them.  Pomellas character is a bit too Pants for me to ever connect.  Sim, on the other hand, surprised me by being the most interesting character in the book.  As did one other character who shall remain nameless.The plot is pretty strong, if predictable, but a book like this will live or die by the worldbuilding.  Mystic draws from a Celtic tradition, as I gather from advance commentary, the heavy use of green, the tree imagery, the druidic depiction of Pomella on the cover and the High Mystic, the island setting, and the use of the fae.  If groan-worthy terms like jagged, dunder, mhathir, and fathir have Celtic roots, they were best left there.  Mystic takes place on the Island of Moth, somewhere in size between Ireland and the Isle of Man.  The magic system, which involves somehow unveiling the Myst and reaching across into fairyland, isnt developed enough to be interesting.  The one thing that is interestingand awesomeis the Green Man, the servant and guardian of the High Mystic, who travels through the ground and simply constitutes itself wherever it appears from the ground at hand, whether soil, rock, or foliage.Ultimately I dont think it was enough to get me to pick up book 2, although there is plenty of potential there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI7I4MNF3V9ZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765381974#wasThisHelpful","RI7I4MNF3V9ZG","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Traitor Son Cycle might be the best epic fantasy series ongoing right now.  Cameron is known for his historical fiction (published as Christian Cameron), and he is really good at the things you would expect him to be good at.  There is a lot of what Ive seen called vambrace porn.  Which has a certain negative connotation, but Cameron shows the rich tapestry of medieval life in a way fantasy all too rarely does.  The battle scenesand there are a lot of them, in the series and in this bookare phenomenaltense, chaotic, and bloody.  The character list is long, and those characters are distinct and think like people from a very different time.  As the story blooms into an epic, the main characters grow and the minor characters flesh out.  And the story takes a distinctly fantastic turn as godlike beings begin to take a more direct hand.  Those fantastical elements are really, really good.  Cameron continues to build on his interesting hermetical magic system.  But it is his wild, wonderful Wild full of monsters and magic that makes The Traitor Son Cycle.The Dread Wyrm, book three in The Traitor Son Cycle, picks up where The Fell Sword left off.  Thorn continues to plot and the Wild to roil, the Galles continue to infiltrate the Albin court, the Black Knight leads an invasion from the north, and the Red Knight returns as Duke of Thrake for the kings tournament.  The tournament, as it turns out, is largely sidelined by bigger matters.  The marches are preparing for another great incursion by the Wild, the Albin capital is more interested in what becomes really an invasion by Galles and the imprisonment of the queen, and both parties pull at Gabriel, the Red Knight.  As does his mother.It all has a frenetic, realistic quality, as events outpace characters plans.  In a less talented writers hands the pacing could be ruinous.  Cameron keeps things both hurtling along and on the tracks.  He also has a talent for ending on a beat.  There is a rhythm to his writing.Royal Guards in brilliant scarlet escorted a tall young man whose honey-blond hair and elegant features might have been irkish.  Indeed, many troubadours claimed irk blood flowed among the people of Occitan.  They spoke a different form of Gallish, and they sang songs from Iberia and Ifriquya as well as from Alba and Galle.  In coastal towns, there were even mosques, tolerated by the princes.  Occitan was a land of song, and oranges.And very skilled knights.He is also darkly funny at times:Lets win the battle.  Thenwell have a command meeting.This made her smile.  Unless were dead.Right, in which case the meeting is off.The Traitor Son Cycle is marked by Loads and Loads of Characters, but it is also very much the story of Gabriel Muriensat one point described as looking like an archangel on a bingeand never more so than in book 3.  The unlikeable and, even worse, at times uninteresting character from the first book has become one of the great characters in fantasy and a Power in his own worlda duke of the Empire, his family controlling the breadth of the Wall, commanding a tremendous private army and a fae magician.No less is the wild, wonderful Wild, full of insectoid boglins, old-school elfish irks, great golden bears with paws that can wield an ax, massive wyverns, and reptilian daemons.  Its massively intriguing, less surreal perhaps than r-examples of Mordor and the Blight, but much more complex.  There is no existing Evil Overlord, at least not yet.  It is a land of Powers, and a Power is first a Power and second a target.  And the greatest powers of all are dragons, things just short of gods who can appear as mountainous, kaiju-scale reptiles but also any number of other forms and who can change reality with a thought.The influence of the dragons on the story is something Ive been worried about since their introductionhow do you maintain narrative tension and the role of the human characters when gods walk amongst them?but Cameron (again) handles the problem adroitly.  Their near omniscience is muddled like a creek when they stick their fingers in.  And with great power comes great enemies, and in numbers.  Being just god-like has its disadvantages.Cameron otherwise dances on the razor edge of chaos.  We appear to be in one of those dangerous second acts, but Cameron keeps the pedal to the floor.  The worst I can say is that the first of many climaxes (hardly more than halfway through) outshines the latter.  They weaken a bit as they go.  The Black Knights role, in the end, tis but a flesh wound, and another seemingly major plot point seems to fizzle.  So, when does the next book come out?","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R205JYK617I24W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011J4H2XS#wasThisHelpful","R205JYK617I24W","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And from that one-note joke comes a pretty damn fine novella.  The Captaina scowling, one-eyed mouseand his crew lost a civil war, a country, an eye, and a wing.  Now the Captain is getting the teamThe Buildersback together for a little revenge.Youll note that that doesnt have much to do with the fact that the characters are all (all, no humans to be seen) animals.  The animal nature of the characters (the bad guys are animals too, a skunk, a cat, a fox, and a rattle snake, with rats for mooks) informs their abilities and attributes but otherwise largely irrelevant.  Its not much more than an excuse to have a salamander gunslinger, badger muscle, a stoat assassin, and a possum sniper.  Not that I will complain, mind you.  Polansky doesnt get cutesy with it and adds what it will when available.There is a solid yarn underneath.  The setting is evocative of civil war Mexico.  Polansky borrows heavily from the tropes of heist stories.  He stays spare in his writing, with extremely short chapters and no unnecessary narration.  A certain amount of narrative distance introduced works because the work is very short and it avoids any need to hide the ball regarding the plot twists (an impressive number for a novella).  Much like Miles Cameron (I read The Dread Wyrm directly before The Builders), Polansky is skilled at landing a wham line.  Its dark and bloody and a whole hell of a lot of fun.Disclosure: I solicited and received an advance copy of The Builders from the publisher, Tor.com.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R174UNV9865ETV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765385309#wasThisHelpful","R174UNV9865ETV","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Walking Dead, Compendium 3 collects comics #97-144, the same comics collected in volumes 17-24.  As you can see, its quite a bit fatter than the first and second compendiums, despite collecting the same number of volumes.MILD SPOILERS THROUGHOUTIts impossible to discuss almost 50 issues without getting just a little spoilery.  I promise I wont give away any more than necessary.  Three is the best of the compendiums.  Compendium One was frequently The Walking Dead at its best but a little uneven.  Compendium Two suffered from The Walking Deads long post-Governor malaise.  The Walking Dead has always been better with a villainous focus.  It is, after all, at its core about the human heart in conflict with another human heart (which is slightly more Faulknerian than the human heart in conflict with the zombie heart).  Or at least that is where it is most effective.  The Walking Dead certainly isnt, to my chagrin, about a fight against nature for survival (but put us city boys in the woods with no one to hand us food and wed struggle mightily).  The human heart in conflict with itself stuff is often very good in isolation, but it has never managed to give the story the same narrative force as squaring off against a big foe.Compendium Three picks up shortly after the introduction of the Saviors and introduces Negan (and Lucille), who makes the Governor look like a pansy (and has a better sense of humor).  Thus begins a conflict that will span most of the compendium and get very, very bloody.  Its the first compendium set in civilization, with the main characters never wandering without a base.  It appears at this point that we have permanent communities.  It also features a long jump in time (roughly two years later).  The comic finally admits to the realities of time.  The survivors are now riding horses and have settled into a quasi-normal life.  This, and the compendium, last just long enough to set up a new grand foe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X2GMWP0ELOS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632154560#wasThisHelpful","R2X2GMWP0ELOS6","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shadows of Self is a book that was not supposed to be but perhaps instead was meant to be.  Brandon Sanderson has long voiced his plan to revisit the Mistborn universe with an urban fantasy featuring essentially contemporary technology.  But the famously hardworking and productive Sanderson needed a break between long books and decided to pound out a short book.  That short book turned into The Alloy of Law, and Sanderson liked what he had so much he decided to turn it into a trilogy.  And it shows in that Shadows of Self is much more concerned with the broader Mistborn world (and the broader Cosmere) and in telling a big story than The Allow of Law.  It is sometimes disjointed, but also combines fascinating temporal worldbuilding and kickass characters.Shadows of Self finds former Roughs (think Wild West) still back in the city and acting as a semi-official constable (think Batman without a secret identity).Wax is one of the most powerful lords in Elendel, can use his metal-based abilities to traverse the city in great leaps and turn coins into projectiles as deadly as the bullets from his gun, and wields his powers fighting crime as a semi-legal constable.  So basically hes Batman without a secret identity.  Hes joined in crime fighting by Waynean irreverent conman who can slow down time and heal himselfand Marasia solicitor-turned-constable who wields the power of empirical research.Marasis new role in the constabulary as aide to constable-general Aradel (the Gordon to Waxs Batman) breaks her free of her sometimes third-wheel status in The Allow of Law.  She works as an effective adjunct to Waxs story and plays an important, independent role of her own.  She remains adorable in her earnestness and data-geekery.Wayne can be super annoying, and too many of his jokes I dont find enjoyable (there were some pretty funny, implicitly dirty jokes in thereI dont remember so many from the first book).  We learn a bit more about his past though, and the parts dwelling on his mastery of disguise are a highlight.Waxs fiance Steris has a very small role but steal every scene she is in because Sanderson imbues all of her scenes with a tremendous dry humor (and I greatly prefer that to his more usual witticisims).  Aradel is another highlight.This is indisputably Waxs book (and series), though.  All of the other characters are moving in his orbit, to their frequent chagrin.  He does have a very particular set of skills.  Skills he acquired as a lawman in the Roughs.  Skills that make him a nightmare for criminals.  But he is ill-prepared for what he is to face in Shadows of Self when he sees the face of Bloody Tan in a crowd while chasing down a robber.  The same Bloody Tan Waxs lover Lessie died bringing to justice.  Meanwhile, the governors brother and half the criminal bosses in the city are killed at his mansion.  Fiction is kind of all about heaping pain and conflict on your characters and Wax suffers more than any man should bear here.Sanderson does something in Shadows of Self similar to what Larry Correia does with his Grimnoir Chronicles by introducing major new elements in the second book of the trilogy instead of really building off of the events of the first, with the idea presumably being to tie the two together and build off both in the final volume.  (Cormac McCarthys Border Trilogy is an example that does this to an extreme, with the first two books entirely independent of each other.)  He does tie back to the events of the first book (albeit really only to the events at one end).Sanderson is known for his action scenes and his elaborate, rule-based magic systems.  Shadows of Self features that, but to a lesser degree than The Alloy of Law.  Instead we get characterization and lots and lots of worldbuilding.  There are lots of callbacks and tie-ins with the original series.  Sanderson does something really cool in exploring the ramifications of the monumental events of the original series three hundred years later.  But he also keeps a light enough touch not to turn off readers (like me) who havent read the original series or readers not into that sort of thing.  It also appears to have an important tie to the larger Cosmere.Sanderson as always is adept at pacing, plot structure, and packing one hell of an emotional wallop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10KO6OAKP43UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765378558#wasThisHelpful","R10KO6OAKP43UD","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Vanishing Glow is self-published.  It shows with an utterly wretched cover and wretched map.  The words on the inside, though, are another story.  The writing is technically proficientmore than proficientand wouldnt look out of place in a traditionally published work.  The early modern setting (A Vanishing Glow is billed as Flintlock Fantasy, but perhaps better fits as Steampunk or Clockpunk) is complex and dynamic.  The characters are likeable (albeit with one major complaint), and the magic system interesting and well used.  The plot, on the other hand, does have some issues.Jason Tern has returned to civilization from fighting on the frontier with his Windriders at the behest of his childhood friend Nole.  Nole is taking his fathers position as High Sovereign of the Federation and wants Tern to take his place as Lord Regent.  The position comes with a seat on a council deeply divided by tensions between the growing, industrialized west and a more traditionally powerful east becoming inundated with migrants from the west.  Nole threatens to upset this delicate balance with his reformist notions, and the Federation is young yet.  Meanwhile, a young sapper in the army named Nilya invents a device that could have far-reaching implications and a hard-bitten reporter named Hugh sees something he should not have seen.The Federation has early modern technology, with flintlock pistols and muskets.  It is also rapidly industrializing thanks to mystech.  Magic-infused crystals which can be used to power anything from lights to brass construct arms.A Vanishing Glow is dragged down mightily by the fact that for the large bulk of the book, Jason Tern at no point does anything that isnt idiotic.  The best that can be said is that Tern isnt given the Idiot Ball to temporarily carry to advance the plot.  No, its an all the time thing, so thats just characterization.  The second, and secondary, POV character Nilya is much more compelling.  Unfortunately, her storyline only tangentially connects with the primary storyline.  (Hugh, on the other hand, interacts directly with Tern).Its a strong plot overall, although it starts a bit slow and has issues in spots.  Its technically two books in a single volume, I guess, although they stand together much better than they would apart.  The story ends with a satisfying conclusion but sets the stage for the series to continue.I received a copy of A Vanishing Glow from the author.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CTYR44NU5872/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013CW2T0G#wasThisHelpful","R2CTYR44NU5872","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my review of The Clockwork Dagger, the first book in the Clockwork Dagger duology (and how nice is it to change pace with a duology?), I criticized it for being eminently put-downable.  Through roughly the first half of The Clockwork Crown, I felt the same way.  I was almost ready to give up entirely after a particularly groan-worthy twist.  And then things got really, really interesting.Crown opens right after Dagger closes with Octavia and Alonzo fleeing south from the Waste.  They head to Alfonsos homeland in search of knowledge of the Tree from the souths famed libraries.  Andthats the weird thing about the above mentioned point where things started to get interesting.  They really did, I loved it, and I blazed through the rest of the book.  But it sort of discards much of what happens in the first half of the book so I dont see much point to dwelling on it.  Viola Stout also disappears almost entirely, albeit to be replaced with two great characters.  On the whole, it really feels like Cato changed her mind about the direction she wanted to take the book but didnt go back and rewrite the first half to match (and at that point the opportunity to revise the first book had probably passed).Its ok, because the second half is so strong and because Crown continues to do well what Dagger did well.  Cato avoids fumbling the transition from will they or wont they with Octavia and Alonzo to what can fairly be characterized as a relationship.  Theyre adorable.  Much is revealed about the nature of the Lady and the history of Caskentia and the Waste.  The highlight remains Catos robust, well thought out system of magical medicine.  Medicians place the injured or sick in an enchanted circle and ask for the Ladys aid.  Herbs have specific uses.  Pampria, for blood loss.  Bartholomews tincture, to repair his chipped ribs.  Heskool root, against infection.  Bellywood bark, to counteract zymes [germs].  Linsom berries, to mend skin.  Medicians wear clothes enchanted to stay clean and carry wands that remove blood and dirt at a wave.  Medicians hear a persons health as music, discordant if they suffer some ailment.  And Octavia, already the most powerful medician in over a generation, begins to hear the health of everyone around her, almost to the point of debilitation (this continues the theme of Octavias great distaste for the city).Disclosure: I received a(n unsolicited) copy of Clockwork Crown from the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D84O5K143F3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062313983#wasThisHelpful","R1D84O5K143F3J","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Healing magic is usually, to put it bluntly, boring.  Hands are laid, wounds are healed, and *poof* on we go.  Granted, thats all the author is usually looking for, a cheap plot device to keeps things moving despite the heroes mounting injuries.  So its refreshing to see a magic system that is focused on healing, central to the plot, and actually interesting.  Octavio Leander is a medician (great neologism, by the way).  Not only is she a medician, she is the most talented medician of her time.  Which is how she finds herself on an airship with someone who wants her dead and someone who just wants to kidnap her.The Clockwork Dagger has a lot going for it.  Octavia is an interesting, endearing protagonist.  Alfonso is an effective, attractive love interest.  The magic system is inventive and helps drive the plot without being a mere plot device.  Cato hints at a lot of subgenresromance, steampunk, dieselpunk, weird westernin intriguing ways.  It also has much of the trappings of a locked room mystery as Octavia comes under attack during the course of the airship trip.  And thats where The Clockwork Dagger really stumbles.  Hinting at genres finally catches up to Cato, as it doesnt really work as a mystery.  And despite a deft hand by Cato at leaving chapters on cliffhangers, the book as a whole lacks urgency.  Its eminently put-downable, which is a grievous sin, even weighed against many positive traits.  And the worldbuilding, outside of the magic system, still shows pencil lines.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GOCO5TNKUDQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062313843#wasThisHelpful","R3GOCO5TNKUDQ7","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the rise of self-publishing, it was perhaps inevitable that the best (and luckiest) of the lot would be picked up by traditional publishers.  The Martian took the genre by storm and is now a major motion picture, as they say.  The Red garnered similar attention and has now been picked up along with the rest of the trilogy to rave reviews.  Is A Crucible of Souls the next in that line?  As the late Robert Jordan was wont to say, read and find out.What strikes me first and foremost about A Crucible of Souls, in a sub-genre that seems to have discarded its traditional trappings in favor of grimdark, flintlock fantasy, and silk road fantasy, is that A Crucible of Souls is evocative of an older model of epic fantasy.  As much as I enjoy those sub-sub-genres, it is a welcome bit of conventionality.  There is a callow youth destined for great things (much like Garion from the Belgariad or Rand alThor from The Wheel of Time).  There is an intricate magic system (much like The Wheel of Time or anything by Brandon Sanderson) and a guild of sorcerers (much like Hogwarts from Harry Potter or the White Tower from The Wheel of Time, albeit a proper guild).  There are powerful magical artifacts (much like the rings from Lord of the Rings or the terangreal and angreal from The Wheel of Time and literally called trinkets).  There is a vague, foreign attacking force (much like the Draconians from Dragonlance or multiple examples from The Riftwar Cycle).  There is a tangentially related prologue (much like The Eye of the World or A Game of Thrones).  Its comfortable and appealing for the same reasons that all of those books were appealing.  That it garnered its initial success as a self-published work is interesting in that lightacquiring editors who are extremely well read in the genre should perhaps be wise to remember that the average reader is not so jaded.  And in fact, it sometimes works well because of that.  My narrative expectations have changed and once overused tropes now again surprise me.Which is not to say that A Crucible of Souls is not without its significant flaws.  Caldan gets the bulk of the attention and his character arc works very well, but the few other POV characters get short enough shrift that their arcs never develop and their subplots nigh incomprehensible.  The nave youth has long been a stock character in epic fantasy, but Caldan is often nave to the point of foolishness.  The pacing is glacial.  Youll enjoy it if you appreciate the tremendous worldbuilding and like (the very likeable) Caldan, but it is light on action.  Im critical of The Eye of the World for hewing too close to the plot of The Lord of the Rings, but that book moves forward at a feverish pace that A Crucible of Souls cannot begin to match.  Very little of the mysteries hinted at are revealed by book end.All in all, its a fun, albeit flawed, read that brings back fond memories.Disclosure: The publisher sent me a(n unsolicited) copy of A Crucible of Souls.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31YBCYOCW2JMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062407244#wasThisHelpful","R31YBCYOCW2JMY","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I dont read the other Avengers comicsor many comics at all anymore, sadlybut Im trying to read more and Hawkeye came highly recommended.  It was largely against those expectations that my hopes were dashed.Hawkeye follows the eponymous hero (Clint Barton and, less often, the other Hawkeye Kate Bishop) in between the real adventures presumably covered in other comics.  So we get a very beat up and very human hero having micro-adventures on a much more local scale.  That was a description that really appealed to me.  But it really is intended for readers of all those other comics, I think.  It wound up coming off disjointed to a point that it really threw me off and sullied my enjoyment of the stories.  There was too much going on I didnt know about or understand.I do love the art and the use of purple (with five alma maters that use purple in their school colors, though, Im undeniably biased).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KXWBNORCBWLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785165622#wasThisHelpful","R2KXWBNORCBWLR","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dark Ascension is book four in the Generation V series by M.L. Brennan about adorkable, bleeding-heart vampire and crappy-job holding twentysomething Fortitude Scott (Fort for short).  Life isnt so bad for Fortitude Scott anymore.  He has a slightly less crappy job.  He has a slightly less crappy car.  He has a roommate who pays his rent on time and only occasionally leaves human organs in the fridge.  He has a fine stripper kitsune girlfriend.  And hes been able to put off the transition to full vampire.  His life is about to change, though, as his mother approaches death.Vampires are the apex predators of Brennans supernatural world, and Forts mother Madeline Scott governs all of the supernatural creatures in a territory that covers New England and part of eastern Canada.  Fort, his vicious sister Prudence (Fort is also known as Fortitude ScottHoly S***, Were Glad Youre Not Your Sister), and his, er, chivalrous and old-fashioned brother Chivalry act as her lieutenants.  Brennans canon is baroque to say the least, but suffice to say Fort is halfway in his transition to becoming a full vampire, still reliant on his mother for blood and not possessing full vampire strength and speed.The first three books were carried in good part by the unresolved sexual tension between Fort and Suzume, his kitsune bodyguard.  The obvious concern, with Fort and Suzume getting together at the end of book three, is that the story would suffer going forward, as so many TV shows have (Im told by people who watch TV).  Delightfully, though, Fort and Suzumes (Forzume? Suzurt?) burgeoning relationship is a strength.  Suzume, as always, provides much of the levity, including by proxy when Chivalry asks Fort if he is in trouble because his bodyguard has been [air quotes] working nights [air quotes], to which Fort is forced to reply that theyre dating, to the intense discomfort of both parties.  What is a kitsune, you ask?  Tricksters of Japanese extraction who can turn into foxes.The other major supernatural group is the elves, a thankful far cry from the boring, derivative elves hoisted on us for so long:I think he just wanted to see my whole reaction to him, because there was no way to look at him and not have a reaction.  He was one of the scions of the elves, that was without a doubt, and carrying a lot more of the blood than Lilah did.  Early to midtwenties, and tall, perhaps an inch taller than I was, and I hit the six-foot mark.  Like Lilah, he wasnt wearing a glamour.  Id seen the Neighbors who were genetically close to their forebears before without their glamours, and the sight had not been a pleasant onethe almost reptilian cast of the Adhene features didnt mix well with human bone structure, and there was an awkwardness, almost a repulsiveness, in those Neighbors when they werent wearing their glamours.  They didnt have that certain something, that indefinable allure that the true elves had that made strange features compelling and attractive, that overrode the signals our from the primitive, dark parts of our brains that rejected something as other, as ugly, and instead made it beautiful.This man had that.  His neck was just slightly too long for his body, his features cut at angles that no human would possess, but that weird fey beauty was there, making it hard to look away from him.  His hair was pure black, but with a silkiness and a texture that reminded me of Suzumes fur when she was a fox rather than a human.  His skin was pale, not in the translucent way that showed veins and blushes, but pale and glittering like morning frost, almost like a hard exterior.  His eyes were the color of plums taken right from the tree, and his pupil was vertical, like a lizards.(At least he didnt have antlers like a full-blooded elf.)Minor creature groups include the metsan kuniga (werebears), ghouls (who aside from an occasional meal of human flesh usually stick to their day jobs at funeral homes and butcher shops), witches, succubi (who provide the initial conflict in the story when a small group wants to move into the territory and needs the Scotts approval), and the return of the revolting and horrific skinwalkers (a skinwalker is placed on the mantle right near the beginning.  Where True Blood had a taste for taking things to their bizarre, profane logical conclusions, Generation V has a taste more for the absurd.  The post-effects from a succubi feeding rather resemble herpes.  Vampires have to pee immediately after feeding directly on a human (hey, its a lot of liquid).A little levity is need, because things get dark for Fort.  After six hundred years plus walking the Earth, Madeline Scott, the matriarch of the Scott family, is about to die.  The narrative is largely driven by other supernatural groups reacting to the impending death and the Scott siblings coming to grip with sharing increased power over the territory.Its a bit of a slow burn.  Without a lot of action or new introductions to the canon, the story is carried by its poignancy, humor, and absolutely nailing the relationship between Fort and Suzume, including their first big fight.  There has also been a very effective metaphorical aspect to the Generation V series, about growing up, about coming to grips with a family with older mores and a different perspective, and so on.  And grow up Fort has, although he has never quite become a realist.The Generation V series also, funnily enough, works as regional fiction under the definition I gave in my Killing Pretty review.  It is not just a story entrenched in and suffused with New England, but with Rhode Island.Disclosure: I received an advance copy of Dark Ascension through the publishers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R340SCREF1KLEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PT4J1IO#wasThisHelpful","R340SCREF1KLEA","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I break his wrists so I dont have to break his neck.He falls to his knees, but I dont think its the pain, though I make sure theres plenty of that.  Its the sound.  The crack of bones as they shatter.  A sound that lets you know theyre never going to heal quite right and youre going to spend the rest of eternity drinking your ambrosia slushies with two hands.Killing Pretty is the seventh of Richard Kadreys Sandman Slim novels.  It is also being billed as something of a reboot, or at least the perfect jumping in point for a new reader who doesnt want to go all the way back to the first novel.  And I suppose it is, speaking as someone reading their first entry in the series, although thats the sort of answer that you can never give more than half an answer to.  That opening line and paragraph sure as hell set a tone, though.Sandman Slim aka James Stark is distinctly of the nasty, badass sort of anti-hero.  His first, second, and third option is to crack skulls and he does it oh so well, crippling an angel right on the first page.  He is a Nephilim, half an angel, and as the new reader quickly learns, he did a long stint in Hell and most recently sealed away some Old Ones.Theres a lot of that, internal as-you-know-Bobs recounting events (presumably) from the earlier novels.  There is almost too much of it (I prefer to start a book with a bit of flailing around before I can truly get my head above water), but it gives a nice context for the events of the book and fleshes out Stark and his friends.Killing Pretty is urban fantasy, and there are superficial similarities to Jim Butchers Dresden Files.  Stark is a snark-dealing, magic-wielder in a big American city populated by a variety of sub rosa fae types.  But the hard-drinking (Aqua Regia), hard smoking (Maledictions) Stark makes Harry Dresden look like a boy scout.  There are necromancers and vampires, but no elves or werewolves (at least in this book).  Butcher pulls freely from Christian sources, but its most of the game in Killing Pretty, whether angels in Heaven or from Downtown (between that and the heavy noir feel, its as much Ian Tregillis Something More Than Night as Butchers Dresden Files).The other difference between Sandman Slim and the Dresden Files is that the former can be categorized as regional fiction, at least by my definition.  I will take a minute to say what I mean by that.  I dont think its useful to use regional fiction as a means of genre ghettoization, segregating genre fiction from literary fiction (a misnomer itself I will let pass without comment for now).  Rather, the simple test is: could the story be picked up and taken elsewhere without indelibly changing the story?  Are the atmosphere, the milieu, the personality of a place as important to the story as the magic, as the plot, as the characters?  Its not enough for a story to be set in, say, the Appalachian Mountains.  Elmore Leonards Fire in the Hole and Raylan are not regional fiction; Ron Rashs stories are.  Leonards works, for all their merits, are written by someone who never visited Harlan, Kentucky and it shows (Justified did better on this metric, especially after the first season).  Rashs work cant take place anywhere but western North Carolina and be the same stories.  The City of Angels (oh hey, I see what Kadrey did there) is inextricably a part of Killing Pretty.The very strong noir element goes along with that, of course.  L.A. is quintessentially noir.  And along with the long discourses on L.A., all the movie references, all the bit players who show up as bit players, Laurel Canyon and its history, all the tourists, all the high-end shopping, all the traffic, and along with the stylized movie poster cover, complete with a billing block, Starks new reduced state even sees him working part-time as a private detective, the quintessential noir anti-hero.Reveling in the milieu, Kadrey keeps Killing Pretty at a slow burndont expect the pagely fireworks of Skin gameletting the story bloom like a desert cactus, but for a guy like Stark, it is always going to come to a place where [t]here are things that can only be settled a certain way.The publisher sent me a(n unsolicited) copy of Killing Pretty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K5RGGLAM944G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062373102#wasThisHelpful","R2K5RGGLAM944G","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dead Mans Reach is D.B. Jacksons fourth (and, sadly, for now final) book in The Thieftaker Chronicles.  Boston thieftaker and conjurer Ethan Kaille faces a new, unexplainable magical threat during what would prove to be a very, very eventful snowy early 1770.  Two years have now passed since the occupation of Boston by British Redcoats began (and since the events of Thieves Quarry).Regulars patrolled the streets night and day, and with tensions rising, everywhere they went they encountered the taunts of young men inflamed by drink or simply the folly of youth.  Those tensions begin to boil over when customs officer Ebenezer Richardson shoots into a mob in front of his house and kills a young boy named Christopher Seider (a real event).  Kaille, of course, is there to see it.  And, to make matters worse, he sensed a conjuring immediately before Richardson made his ill-fated decision to fire into the crowd.Im getting a bit ahead of myself, though.  Dead Mans Reach Starts on a more prosaic note.  Kaille has once again run afoul of his thieftaking rival, Sephira Price.  My patience for this sort of run-in ended with Thieves Quarry, or perhaps Thieftaker, but thankfully we move on quickly.  And the initial run-in is our first look at the threat (and mystery) at the center of the book, as one of Prices men suddenly and without provocation attacks the thief they are holding (the attacking is ok, its the failure to wait for orders that is out of character for Prices men).  When it happens again with Richardson, Kaille and the reader more than suspect a link.  In between we get a lot of the reestablishing of characters, past events, and so on that I would generally prefer the writer to keep brief and let the reader catch up, but then its been a year since I read A Plunder of Souls and longer since I read the others, so I probably shouldnt complain.My biggest complaint about A Plunder of Souls was that the political turmoil in colonial Boston took a backseat.  Given the timeframe, it is right back in the forefront in Dead Mans Reach.  Further, Kaille is in the center of it, as the strange conjurings precede every act of violence pushing Boston toward a tipping point.  He meets with Lieutenant (and Acting) Governor Thomas Hutchinson.  Both Samuel Adams and Dr. Joseph Warren play prominent roles.  Future president John Adams even makes an appearance.  The book climaxes shortly after a night that lives on in infamy.  Jacksons decision to give his protagonist strong initial Tory leanings again pays off, and we get the supreme payoff of seeing him finally self-identify as a patriot after four books.  All of this is I think accurate (sans the conjuring) and I know skillfully woven into the narrative (or vice versa).Jackson is a well practiced hand at this, and it shows.  Kaille and the other characters have had time to firmly settle into their roles.  For all my frustrations with Sephira Price, her interactions with Kaille after the initial one are often a highlight.  Kailles relationship with Kannice, the owner of his favorite pub (I suspect an ulterior motive) plays a more important role and adds a strong romance element to the stew.  Kaille has become more powerful and assertive even as the events of the book drive him to self-doubt and loathing.  He also throws around more snark (what do the kids say these days?  Shade?  Salt?) than I remember.  This chapter in the Chronicles is, as always, strongest as an urban fantasy, and the mystery at the heart of the story is a bit too predictable.Now whats it going to take to convince Jackson to write a fifth book?","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE43OLLXCV241/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S52BU9K#wasThisHelpful","RE43OLLXCV241","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Genghis Khan was the greatest conqueror the world has ever known.  He consolidated the disparate clans and tribes of Mongolia.  He conquered the Jin (northern China) and Kwarezmian (Persia) empires.  The Mongol empire covered twelve million contiguous square milesan area as large as Africa and bigger than North America; by contrast the extent of the Roman empire was about half that of the continental U.S.A. . . .  The modern population of the countries ruled by the empire at its greatest extent [today] contain three billion of the worlds seven billion population.  He also totally ravaged Oshmans Sporting Goods.MyLynn seeks to provide a synthesis of all the scholarship done in the major European languages in the past forty years relating to Genghis and his sons.  (McLynn covers not only Genghis but the three great khans between Genghis and the break-up of the empireOgodei, Guyuk, and Mongkewith Ogodei being the most substantial, taking up multiple chapters.)  And indeed one of McLynns strengths is discussing the varying scholarly views.  His other strength is providing social history.  He stumbles when forced to relay events and battles, and it can sometimes seem no more than an endless recital of massacres with pyramids of skulls.  The other weakness is his writing, which is heavy on $4 words in $2 sentences and tortured metaphors and figures of speech.FROM SEA TO SHINING SEAMcLynns book covers much more than you might expect from an ostensible biography of Genghis Khan.  He attempts to give a history of the Mongols and the steppe to Genghis.  In addition to Genghiss exploits, McLynn frequently provides contextual information, not only about the later Mongol empire(s) but also about other societies (notably the birth of the Jin Empire).  He covers the three great khans to follow Genghis as well as other major Mongol figures, such as Subedei, who came to Temujins camp when he was ten years old, a starry-eyed boy who had spent all his life among the reindeer in the taiga and had never seen the steppe before before going on to become one of the greatest generals in Genghis military meritocracy.Considerable space is devoted to Genghis consolidation of the steppe tribes, his 23 year war against the Jin Empire (only 5 of which Genghis was present for), his conquest of the Khwarezmian Empire, and the invasion of Europe.  This is truly history writ large.  After vanquishing the Khwarezmian Empire, Genghis Khan . . . ruled an empire that stretched from the Pacific to the Caspian, from Korea to the Caucasus, and from Siberia to the Yellow River.During the invasion of Europe [i]n three years the two captains and their men rode 5,500 mileshistorys longest cavalry raidwon seven major battles (always against superior numbers) and several minor engagements and skirmishes, sacked scores of cities and revealed the world of Russia and eastern Europe to Genghis.HOME ON THE STEPPEMongol herdsmen handled five different types of domestic animal: sheep, goats, cattle, horses, and Bactrian camels (sheep were the most valuable, but horses the most valued).Unlike many horses, the Mongolian horses could subsist wholly on grazing.  Mongols kept three remounts on campaign and rotated mounts every two hours.  This allowed marches as long and fast as 600 miles in 9 days (a record not matched until the era of Napoleon).  The Mongols had so many horses they could specialize, using geldings for ambushes instead of stallions or mares, for instance.Nomads had great advantages over pastoral peoples at war.  They could provide twice as many soldiers per capita as pastoralists.  Their military speed was a product of the nomadic life.  Not only were their soldiers horsemen accustomed to long days in the saddle, camp followers and even families could keep up, and they brought giant herds of cattle and sheep.A LIMITED BRILLIANCEAs mentioned above, the Mongols were well adapted to wars of conquest.  Their mounted archers provided a distinct advantage of the usual infantry of the day, their archery and horsemanship skills were bar none, and they could move fast and they could maintain the pace.  They mastered coordinating large armies both on the hoof and in battle, and they mastered light cavalry tactics, the feigned retreat most of all.  They were quick to learn siege warfare and incorporate explosives and firearms, and they were artists at subterfuge, especially tactics to inflate their perceived numbers (the Mongols were almost always outnumbered and had something of a fetish about keeping casualties to a minimum).They were an uncivilized people but open to change.  They cauterized a wound for the first time in recorded history.  They learned siege warfare and incorporated explosives and firearms from the Jin.  Genghis was illiterate, but [w]hen the importance of writing was explained to him, Temujin was impressed . . . with the consequence that Uighur writing became the official script of the Mongol empire.But it was a limited brilliance.  The empire was never sustainable.  It was the pyramid scheme of empires, relying on ever more conquest and tribute.  Moreover, subjugated peoples couldnt be controlled indefinitely when there were one hundred to every single Mongol.McLynn mentions the aphorism that you could travel from Palestine to Mongolia with a gold plate on your head and not be molested without critical examination.  Based on his own narrative it seems implausible.  Draconian legal code notwithstanding, the Mongols lacked the numbers to effectively police an empire of that scale, and the populations displaced by wholesale slaughter surely led to widespread banditry.  (There is also quite a bit on the Yasa, the secret written code of law created by Genghis.  But it isnt very interesting, even to a legal history nerd like me, but it didnt appear to have much effect at the time let alone long-term.)PROSEAs mentioned above, the narrative is consistently bogged down by what I refuse to call turgid prose:([T]he sources are anything but pellucid.)Muhammed came within an ace of being captured.It took another month for the Mongols to winkle them out.Genghis identified 280 such persons . . . and mulcted them accordingly.[T]he fall of Bukhara had made manifest the manifold latent fissiparous weaknesses in the Khwarezmian empire.This was the moment when the Mongols most clearly impacted on the world of Islam, complicating also the already turbid bouillabaisse that was the Fifth Crusade.Genghis departed this life much as he had lived in it, in a tourbillon of death and bloodshed.When someone else approached him with the begging bowl, his financial advisors tried to kill the request stone dead by pointing out that the man already had massive debts.[W]ithin a week of Ogodeis death . . . Batu knew of it.  This meant that everything in the Mongol empire was now in the melting pot.CONCLUSIONSo how did Genghis do it?  McLynn points to his mounted archers as a great leap forward in military technology, but surely that alone cannot be it.  After all, Julius Caesars contemporary Crassus was mashed by Parthian mounted archers long, long before Genghis time.  More important seems their use of horses and incredible mobility, described above, their use of long-distance relay riders and ability to coordinate large armies on the move over long distances, endless adaptability, detailed planning buttressed by war gaming and intelligence from spies, and Genghis radical reorganization of Mongol military forces along a decimal system.  After Genghis death, Mongols were responsible for the first clear use of firearms in a major engagement in 1232 (including a bamboo cannon, which doesnt sound terribly durable).McLynn doesnt attempt to canonize Genghis, but neither is he unfair.  His final conclusion, though, is harsh: While the Mongols military achievements were stupendous, they were otherwise totally parasitic.  They were unoriginal, founded no new religions, produced no worthwhile cultural artefacts, developed no new crops or technologies (though they transmitted existing ones), created no worthwhile painting, pottery, architecture or literature and did not even bake bread; they essentially relied on the captive craftsmen and experts for everything.Disclosure: I received a comp copy through NetGalley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OSS38PODV6B0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X2ZW5ZI#wasThisHelpful","R3OSS38PODV6B0","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There isnt really a problem with Championship Btok as a story.  The problem is that it isnt a storyits just part of one.  That larger story is likely a good one but this piece of it doesnt work on its own, for reasons that dont have anything to do with the writing or storytelling.Championship Btok (the title refers to a more complicated, alien variant of chess) is an ambitious story with a complicated plot.  It utilizes 3rd-person limited POVs that rotate rapidly among a number of different characters.  Such a technique often leads to a story hard to get a handle on until well into the story.  Which is why a lot of works, including the Wheel of Time, start slow.  Books that dont, including 2015 Hugo best novel nominee The Dark Between the Stars, provide a payoff later in the story.  The problem here is that Championship Btok is so short I didnt get a handle on things until the story was almost over (although it is a long novelette).The btok reference, of course, refers not just to the regular games of btok between the human commander of a former POW planet-camp and the human leader of the defeated, alien Snakes, but to the Snakes clandestine efforts to prepare for a revolt.  But the board appears even bigger than that.  There may be a third group moving not just humans and Snakes but also the other sapient species in the known galaxy by controlling technological progress.  Its cool stuff well done.  But I would prefer to read the full story in one go.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OZXA49WJAVL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U4C23WM#wasThisHelpful","R1OZXA49WJAVL1","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, I'm sure there are wild tales told all over that try to explain the convoluted nature of our bayous.  Stories about alligators eating babies, hoodoo rituals, ghostly Civil War apparitions, racism, and a bunch of old folks sitting on rickety, ancient porches drinking homemade moonshine out of jelly jars while someones great-uncle Beau plays the fiddle.  And its all true.  To an extent.The Witch of Bourbon Street is something we see far too seldom in speculative fictiona rich, deep family drama (Mary Robinette Kowals Glamourist Histories is another great example).  Palmieri also gives us something else we see too little.  The Witch of Bourbon Street maintains an ambiguity around its magic, both in what it can do and what it actually does in the story (you could perhaps argue that The Witch of Bourbon Street isnt speculative fiction at all, but I wouldnt go that far).  Its regional fiction in that it is fiction of and about a place that could not be lifted out of it and set elsewhere.  And, most of all, it is beautifully written.I grew up the way water moves, in twists and turns with temperamental, amorphous boundaries.  And I danced, lightly, over precarious situations and a thousand half-submerged ideas as they tried to surface above the waters of my bayou, reaching out their pale limbs and beautiful, lost faces from under the dark waters.Frances is a Sorrow, and the Sorrows are an old French family turned bayou aristocrats.  They are also witches.  Cursed witches, it appears, and the mystery of what led to the death of almost every Sorrow, and the evident downfall of their family, a hundred years ago hangs over the events in the present day.  As does a choice made by Frances fifteen years prior.  That choice led Frances to abandon New Orleans for the bayou, to shut herself off from the world, and to leave her husband and child Frances and Dannys marriage was doomed from the start.  Because marriage, a little house on the corner, and forgoing magic was not Frances and never could be.  But mostly because fifteen years ago Frances abandoned a child that may or may not be Dannys.Her daughter Sippies decision to seek her out, her son Jacks decision to run away, and her friend Millies jealousy, all against the backdrop of an approaching storm, set in motion the events of the novel.Disclosure: I received an advance copy of The Witch of Bourbon Street via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XS443EV8ITFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYGJG2O#wasThisHelpful","R2XS443EV8ITFS","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Big Boys Dont Cry is a far-future military SF told from the perspective of an AI-tank.  A 14,000 ton hover-tank run by a fusion reactor.  (By way of comparison, a German Panzer tank of the sort that shows up in the training simulation ran 25 tons.  The proposed German Landkreuzer P. 1000 Ratte super-heavy tank was only supposed to be 1,000 tons.)  The story concerns itself with the tank, Maggie, coming to grips with war and her role in it.AI of the sort is a popular topic, although its usually a spaceship thats sapient.  Kratman introduces a few twists.  There is no Asimovs First Law of Robotics (why would we ever want that?).  The tanks are designed as individuals because it makes them more suited to combat.  Other programming makes less sense.  The tanks can think and question and, most interestingly, feel pain, but cant disobey.Maggie is disabled early on in the novella, which robs the many (good) later battle scenes of tension.  The military brass is evil to mustache-twirling levels.  I see what Kratman is trying to doraise questions of the implications of replacing an all-volunteer military with (pliant) AIand he does that effectively, but the narrative doesnt quite work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P69OFY4KGNXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKT7HQI#wasThisHelpful","R3P69OFY4KGNXA","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One Bright Star to Guide Them is sort of a riff on the Chronicles of Narnia 30 years later with the children all grown up.  Tommy is living a very boring, normal life, pending big promotion notwithstanding, when hes visited by an old friend from the past.  A black cat.  Specifically the prince of cats (although in my experience all cats think they rank as at least a prince).  A little waffling and Tommy is off on adventures again.And things sort of go off the rails all over the place.  Wright spends more time telling than showing, just sort of ejaculating proper names and events in rapid sequence without context.  There is some of this in Pale Realms of Shade but not nearly as much.  Huge swaths of the story take place off-screen and we have to suffer through the re-telling.  Perhaps because Tommy jumps directly from paunchy, middle-aged sad-sack to tanned, hardened adventurer without showing us the six weeks of adventures that led from Point A to Point B.  The prose is more even, but it never soars to the heights of Pale Realms of Shade.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EES0T8L3EL29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9760GO#wasThisHelpful","R1EES0T8L3EL29","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And so we return over 20 years later (I recognize there were two more movies, but for me any Jurassic Park movie is going to be measured against the original).  The set-up is straightforward.  With their parents preparing for divorce, teen Zach and pre-teen Gray are shuffled off to go visit their Aunt Claire.  Who happens to run Jurassic World, now20-years later in movie time as wella full-out amusement park hosting 20,000 people a pop that sprawls across the island.  Teenager-y Zach and dinosaur-obsessed Gray get shuffled off (again) to an assistant with skip-the-line passes.  Claire is busy closing a deal with Verizon to get their name in the movie because phones arent big enough (yet) to slap a Mercedes star-sized trademark on.  She wants Verizon to sponsor their newest attraction and help them become more relevant (my PR professional-wife let out an involuntary cheer at that point).  That attraction?  A genetically-engineered new dinosaur they call Indominus Rex.  Rounding out the main cast are Owen, an experimental Velociraptor trainer and former Navy man, and Misrani, the oil-and-telecom tycoon who owns the park.In the least spoilery-spoiler I could possibly give, the Indominus Rex is where things all go wrong.  Who could have thought that giving a T-Rex long arms would be a bad idea?  Who could imagine a 50-foot long dinosaur climbing a 40-foot tall wall?  The Indominus Rex keeps coming up with new surprises, each somehow gained from another little bit of DNA spliced in (e.g., cuttlefish, tree frog).  I didnt stick around for the stinger, but I can only assume it was Professor Xavier offering the Indominus Rex a spot with the X-Men.  Everything about the Indominus Rex screams that it is a terrible idea.  It ate its sister.  It grew to be much bigger than expected.  The people who run the park seem to have no idea of the source of its genetic material beyond a T-Rex base.  Apparently while the park owns the attraction, the intellectual property remains the proprietary property of InGen, which contracts with the park.  The corporate structure is unclear (the story of my life).But its good that everything goes wrong, because were all here for the dinosaurs, right?  We get a lot of them.  The Indominus Rex may be unoriginal (again, T-Rex with long arms), but its still a dang cool monster.  And after some Godzilla-Cloverfield style teasing, we get to see plenty of it in its full glory.  There is also Owens pack of Velociraptors (and the Velociraptors were the real stars of the first movie), a Mosasaurus (the whale-dinosaur featured in the trailer), Pterodactyls and other flying dinosaurs, my personal favorite the mace-tailed Ankylosaurus, and of course the T-Rex makes an appearance.Jurassic World is not a perfect movie.  Nothing InGen does makes sense.  Its horribly unsubtle.  Characters spout ethical arguments without engaging in the context and without interest from their purported audience.  The movie sometimes beats you over the head with callbacks and references to the first movie (and presumably the other two) and fourth-wall bending responses to complaints (the dinosaurs arent designed realistically because Rule of Cool).  Much of the magic of the original was always out of reach, but its sad to see the scientists take a back seat (the only scientist who shows up is one of the bad guys).  The characters are facially a-character-with-trait-x.  Zach is the teen who doesnt want anything to do with his parents or his kid brother.  Gray is the annoying kid providing a constant feed of facts and figures (I was that kid; I still am that kid.)  Claire is the impersonal workaholic.  Owen is the animal whisperer who you know is cool because he uses the s-word, like right off the bat.  Misrani is the eccentric billionaire.But it works.  Zach and Gray may be archetypes but those are archetypes for a reason, and the poignant scene where they discuss their parents impending divorce gives emotional heft for the terror of the rest of the movie.  Claire is the weakest link early on but really comes into her own in the second half of the movie (the trick was rolling up her sleeves and tying her shirt off in the front).  Owen keeps being awesome but its a good thing they didnt ask him to carry the movie.I was worried that with a full park, now with its own paramilitary force, that it wouldnt work as well as a horror movie.  Nope, its legit scary.  The action scenes, whether dinosaur-on-man or dinosaur-on-dinosaur are well done and the special effects are top-notch.  A quiet scene with a dying Apatosaurus does more to establish the dinosaurs as real animals that all those lines of dialogue on the front-end.  The plot holes are Velociraptor-sized, not T-Rex-sized (this is all you can really ask).  It can be very funny, mainly courtesy of New Girls Jake Johnson.My biggest complaint?  I didnt go see it at an IMAX theater.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROY6A6KJFYOFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYC5II0#wasThisHelpful","ROY6A6KJFYOFH","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Faulkner was right.  The past is never dead.  Its not even past.  The best fictionand especially the best second-world fantasyrecognizes that.  George R.R. Martins A Song of Ice and Fire does it perhaps better than any other series.  The events of the series are all driven by things that happened twenty years prior.  Theres no reason The Dark Between the Stars inherently cant work for a reader who hasnt read The Saga of Seven Suns, the series set twenty years prior.  But a good third of the book is bogged down by a lot of what-this-character-has-been-up-to-for-the-past-15-years.And there are a lot of characters.  There are a few ways to approach an epic fantasy/space opera.  An author can start the story with a group of characters in the same place and let things splinter from there (e.g., The Wheel of Time).  An author can concentrate a few major, concurrent storylines (e.g., The Stormlight Archive).  Or an author can just say f it and start with loads and loads of characters whose storylines only interact down the line.  Anderson chooses the third option so we hear what lots of people have been up to.Lots of people.  There are, I think, upwards of 30 POV characters, which led to me spending much of early chapters trying to figure out who exactly the POV character is and what the heck theyre up to.  Which I had to do very quickly, because the chapters are extremely short.  Like Seven Pillars of Wisdom short.  At 672 hardcover pages, Anderson blows through 139 chapters at less than 5 pages per chapter.  I appreciate a quick clip, but that is pushing it.  It makes for a very different reading experience than, say, The Goblin Emperor, which is entirely from the view of a single character and has chapters that vary wildly in length.None of this would work absent Andersons obvious skill.  He can and does establish character and setting quickly.  The seemingly disparate plot threads wind up cunningly tied together.  The time invested in the characters and the relative tranquility during the slow start adds emotional heft to the latter action.  There is a wonderful respect for imagined intergalactic industry, from hydrogen sky mining on gas giants to lava planet mining, without getting bogged down in the minutiae of either the science or the economics.I wont try to do justice to the characters.  There are too many to address, and I could find somethingsomething kind even!to say about most to all of them.  There are two main allied races, humans and Ildirans, with frequent mentions and infrequent appearances of the antagonists from the prior series.  The humans are still Earth-centric, although the Moon is now an asteroid belt thanks to events from 20 years before and the human Confederation leadership is now based on a forested planet called Theron.  The sentient forest of world trees on Theron produces human green priests who can communicate with and through the trees, allowing instantaneous interstellar communication via treeling-bearing green priests.  (And sometimes the world trees launch into orbit to serve as planetary defense battleships.  That is awesome.)  The Ildirans are a humanoid race strongly bound by their quasi-telepathic theism that hail from a world with seven suns (if a three-body problem is bad how bad is a seven-body problem?), with resulting pathological fears of being alone and the darkness.  Prominently featured are the human-Ildiran children of the Ildiran Mage-Imperator, who possess telepathic powers.  The new threat that arises (as it must now, else the series would be set later), is an entropic force that causes ship system failures, can create hexagonal tube battleships, and attacks the Ildirans through the theism.  The Shana Rei, the second coolest cloud of dust after the Nebula awards and the titular dark between the stars, ally themselves with insectoid robots.  Thats right.  Bugbots.  As designed by insectoid aliens (of course there are (sadly offscreen) insectoid aliens, because what other kind of evil aliens are you going to have, spinning octupedal aliens?  That would be crazy.).  Its somewhat depressing that the above was a bit funner to write about than read.All in all?  Im not blown away, but its cool.  It makes me want to read more science fiction, a genre Im woefully ill-read in (although I think Im woefully ill-read in all genres, because have you ever seen a library?  There are SO MANY BOOKS.).  Its probably a pretty good illustration for a literary-pulp divide I want to talk about in the future at great length, because it tends to be pretty good at the components of the latter and distinctly weaker at the components of the former.  It suffers, as I hope Ive shown, from being a follow-on series.  It also suffers some from being the opening volume in a series.  Not that I would reflexively ding a book 1 for leaving things untiedIm an unabashed aficionado and advocate of the Very Long Seriesbut things untied must be balanced against a deposited burning desire to continue.  I enjoyed it, but I havent yet rushed out (to Internet Explorer, alt-tab yall) and bought Book 2.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4QUIU2TOZCDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I1VV3II#wasThisHelpful","R4QUIU2TOZCDF","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Three-Body Problem opens at a public rally intended to humiliate and break down . . . enemies . . . through verbal and physical abuse until they confessed their crimes before the crowd.  Who are those enemies?  Academics.  And what was their crime?  Daring to disperse the ideas of reactionary academic authorities that represent reactionary idealism.  The reactionary academics (their accusers are the sort of people who use the word reactionary a lot) had started out as arrogant and stubborn but were softened up by the public humiliation sessions that consisted of someone scream[ing] in their faces to make them mechanically recite their confessions, already repeated countless times.  Eventually the conditioning took its toll and [t]hey began to really believe that they were guilty.  The admissions of guilt themselves, though, are boring.  The real sadistic joy comes from breaking the will of academics who refuse to admit their already-determined guilt.Is The Three-Body Problem a near-future dystopia, with the victims American academics who refuse to pander to the half-baked postmodern, critical studies orthodoxies of students who think Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity represents the height of thinking?  No, rather than an all-too-plausible future, The Three-Body Problem opens during Chinas Cultural Revolution.  Liu does jump to the near future after opening in the Cultural Revolution, but the events of the first three chapters both have a very specific consequenceafter watching her father killed at one of the rallies, one of the main characters, Ye Wenjie, is spurred to much later take the single action that serves as the catalyst for the entire seriesand set a certain tone.The Three-Body Problem only spends three chapters in the past before rather abruptly shifting to the near-future.  Part II opens with Wang Maio, a physicist working on nanotech, being pulled from his home by two cops and two PLA officers, including a swaggering, chain-smoking police officer named Shi Qiang, a character that grates in the best sort of way.  He is taken to a meeting of a cross-functional, pan-national group that asks him to infiltrate an organization called the Frontiers of Science in the wake of the suicides of three prominent physicists.  Thats when things start to get weird.  Wang Maio learns that three recently completed giant particle accelerators have been producing different results (impossibly).  Then a mysterious countdown begins to appear on Wang Maios photographs.  Not content to idle away his time on photography, Wang Maio also becomes immersed in a virtual reality video game called Three Body.From here we get into spoiler territory.  The video game features a world that varies unpredictably between stable periods and chaotic periods.  During the chaotic periods the sun may rise from any direction, for any amount of time, may vary dramatically in size, or may not rise at all.  The game revolves around predicting the periods, and a wrong prediction frequently leads to the death of a civilization and the end of the game.  Wang Maio eventually figures out that the chaotic periods are caused by three suns, each exerting gravitational pull on the planet on which the game is set and on each other.  This is the seemingly insurmountable physics problem from the title.  The video game is a test of sortsanyone who gets far enough along is recruited by a shadowy organization, and it is revealed that the game is based on a real alien race that has been in contact with humanity.  Now they are on their way to earth with conquest in mind (its going to take them 450 year, though, so were safe for a bit).The Three-Body Problem is a different sort of book.  It is hard science fiction (there is a physics problem right in the title), when that sort of thing has fallen out of style.  The protagonist is an academic and a physicist, not a soldier or a politician.  It wears its science fiction elements lightly at first, saving much for late in the book and instead (very effectively) borrowing the structure and tropes or thrillers and mysteries.  Wang Maio may be the first protagonist in a thriller to spend most of his time on photography and video games instead of investigation.  Characters like to stop and chat about science and philosophy.  The Three-Body Problem is also a translation.  Thats a feature not a bug.  The stark difference in style threw me off at first but a quickly grew to appreciate its freshness.  It also has footnotes from both the author and translator with wonderful bits of Chinese history and culture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TP9C0J1MY7K2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQO403K#wasThisHelpful","R2TP9C0J1MY7K2","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once Upon a Time in Russia bills itself as a story of the rise of the oligarchs in the subtitle, and as the behind-the-scenes, true story of two larger-than-life billionaire oligarchs in particularBoris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovichin the introduction.  But this is Berezovskys story.  Abramovich plays a surprisingly small row, arguably less important than Georgian strongman and Berezovskys right-hand muscle Badri Patarkatsishvili, former-FSB agent Alexander Litivenko, and Bond villain Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, even Boris Yeltsin and his daughter Tatiana.Berezovsky was one of an early wave of Russians from all walks of lifehe was a half-Jewish former academicto make his fortune in the wake of perestroika.  Berezovsky made his first fortune selling cars bought from the manufacture on credit during a period of gross inflation.  From there he moved into TV (his eventual downfall), oil, and aluminum.  It was oil that sprang from his initial partnership with Abramovich.  Abramovich, already owner of a pipeline, approached Berezovsky with the idea to take a state oil company private, and Berezovsky used his connections to make it happen.  Berezovsky, along with his fellow oligarchs, also uses his connections, his millions, and his TV station to get Yeltsin reelected when it looked like the Communists were going to regain power.It is hard as an American to grasp post-perestroika Russian business.  Berezovsky and Abramovich didnt make millions, they made billions.  Berezovsky and the six confederates he recruited to finance Yeltsins reelection accounted for half of Russias GDP.  Berezovsky lived surrounded by heavily-armed bodyguards and traveling in armored cars.  And with good reason.  Mezrich tells of a near successful assassination attempt at the beginning of the book that destroys Berezovskys car and decapitates his drive.  Berezovsky himself probably orchestrated the killings of at least a couple troublesome journalists and had a business rival very publicly pulled from his office by a gang of submachinegun wielding, balaclava-clad men.Mezrich captures his rise, but it is his fall that is really interesting, because it is also the story of Putins rise.  The oligarchs thought they picked someone they could control, but they picked a Bond villain.  Putins evil is shown most viscerally through Alexander Litivenkos story.  Litivenko was an FSB agent who blew the whistle on the agencys corruption (at Berezovskys urging after Litivenkos superior ordered him to kill Berezovsky).  That may have put Putin at the head of the agency, but he responded by having Litivenko arrested.  After he was finally pronounced innocent by a judge, armed men stormed into the courtroom and arrested him again.  He later fled to London only to become the first man assassinated by nuclear means (polonium).  Berezovsky, as it turned out, had badly misjudged Putin, although he wouldnt be the last to do so (including a couple American presidents).Berezovsky was a larger than life figure (the book ends with his apparent suicide), a bit of a buffoon and a bit of a heel.  But Mezrich has an obvious fondness and presents him in a favorable light, even when presenting him as utterly full of it in bringing his famously huge lawsuit against Abramovich toward the end of the book.Disclosure: I received an advance copy of Once Upon a Time in Russia through NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLVQ888CB1MU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RM266ZM#wasThisHelpful","RLVQ888CB1MU4","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Goblin Emperor is in many ways a very good book, although I dont think its a great book in any way.  Its also very different than the usual speculative fiction fare.Maia is a forgotten fourth son of the emperor banished to a far corner of the Empire when a courier arrives late at night with a message: Maias father and three brothers were all killed in an act of airship terrorism.  And so Maia is thrust into the seat of power without the education, the experience, . . . or the breeding.  Maia, you see, is a goblin, hence the title.  Well, a half-goblin, courtesy of his mother the fourth empress.  The old emperor, all of Maias brothers and the other empresses, and most of the subjects of the empire are elves.  (The book doesnt have much to say about the difference between elves and goblins beyond that goblins have darker skin.  I can only imagine that the elves look like ugly Peter Jackson elves and the goblins like Nightcrawler.)Maia is a great character and that is probably the great strength of the novel.  Hes a character that jumps off the page and starts tugging on your heart strings.  He is emotional.  He is most of all endearingly earnest.  He is a product of neglect and abuse and he wears it on his sleeve.  It works when it comes from his internal monologue; it grates when it is expressed through Maia being overly apologetic.Its good that Maia is a strong character because this is Maias story and told entirely from his perspective.  The minor characters unfortunately tend to be very much one note and dont ever leap off the page.  They are usually defined by a single characteristic we see repeatedly.  The single biggest exception, I think, and not unrelatedly the most interesting character, is Maias arranged fiance.  Alas, we see too little of her.Ill get to the worldbuilding next, but The Goblin Emperors biggest weakness is a lack of conflict.  Not just action, but conflict.  And conflict is what drives all fiction, even if it is only the human heart in conflict with itself.  Addison keeps the stakes too low.  In The Wire Tommy Carcetti gets served a s*** sandwich almost as soon as he takes office.  Maia doesnt, if only because nothing he does at first seems to be of much greater import (which is the great advantage of the monarchy reallysymbolic leadership is one of the few things government can consistently do well).  It robs the novel of tension, and Maias ostensible great triumph doesnt overcome this.  There are two action set pieces and they work well enough for what they are, which are very limited set pieces.  The first cleverly ties into a single act from earlier in the book but thats it.  The second draws on events from earlier in the book in a more general way.  Both have rather limited effect going forward.  And the broader event that should drive much of the novelbuilding a bridge over a river bisecting the empiredoesnt amount to much.  Its unfortunate.  Bridges have a historical importance not reflected in fantasy.  And something as prosaic as a bridge can drive narrative tension.  For all Atlas Shruggeds faults, the bridge sequence drives the first act.  (There is also a rather groan-worthy metaphor there I will just ignore.)Ive seen The Goblin Emperor described as steampunk.  The steampunk elements are, as usual for the subgenre, presented without explanation or much apparent thought (I like steampunk; the problem is I want to like it more than I do).  We get a few airships and pneumatic tubes and the big bridge is a clockwork drawbridge but theres not a whole lot else.  There is a subtle tension between elves and goblins that Addison revisits often to good effect, but the elf and goblin moniker dont amount to much more than labels.  Far too much of the worldbuilding, especially that emphasized, is clunky or ineffective.  The elaborate naming conventions are mystifying.  The beginning uses bizarre archaisms (lots of thous and tharts) without explanation or seeming purpose.  Thankfully they rarely resurface after.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U7NCN33M4GUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FO6NPIO#wasThisHelpful","R3U7NCN33M4GUN","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was probably inevitable that the second book in the Imperial Radch series would not live up to expectations after Ancillary Justice won all the awards (look it up).  What I did not expect is just how weak a book it would be.Ancillary Justice at its essence had three things going for it: the Radch view on gender and the use of only feminine pronouns, a simple but effective rhetorical trick; the diffuse AI ship Breq and the legion dictator Anaander Mianai; and an otherwise very solid all-around space opera story and world.  I was worried the pronoun thing would begin to grate.  It did not, in part because Leckie wisely chose to shift focus away from it (apart from a bizarre festival that proves not distracting by being so forgettable).  But it also doesnt add anything here in the way it did in the first volume.  As to the second (and much less appreciated) great strength of Ancillary Justice, there are no flashbacks to Breq when she was a ship and Anaander Mianai is almost entirely absent.  Ordered to a new station, Breq doesnt even interact with the Station AI!  But Ancillary Swords real failure is that it isnt a very interesting story.Ancillary Justice ended with the two factions of Anaander Mianai now at open war with each other.  Breq has been dragooned into the service of one.  To that end, she is sent to an obscure, out-of-the-way system that is hinted to be more important than it looks (SPOILER NOT SPOILER: we finish the book without ever finding out).  Breq, now raised to the exalted rank of fleet captain, spends the rest of the book ordering people about on the station and downwell.Second acts in a series are difficult by nature.  The author has typically blown a large portion of her expository load, you cant have full resolution (and usually get even less than in book one), and the primary burden is to get from Point A of a great idea for a series to Point B of a desired climax.  Im not sure if Ancillary Sword fails for that because so very little happens and what does happen appears to have so very little to do with the universe-spanning empire stakes.  There are a couple hints that may become the key to the whole thing, but we only get very bare hints.  Perhaps this is one of those books that, rather than building on the first book, runs almost in parallel instead, with both books together building toward book 3 (Larry Correias Grimnoire trilogy does this to a certain extent, and Cormac McCarthys Border trilogy goes all in).The main story is already burdened by its perceived irrelevance.  The problem is exacerbated by a story that isnt really interested on any level.  It is almost structured as a mystery, but the components to the climax and resolution are either obvious or unknowable.  The basic structure is Breq swoops in, sees obvious problems, dictates obvious solution, with an obvious reaction.  There are a couple of good twists, but we dont get a payoff for either.  The climax would have served as a good faux climax, with a bigger and better one behind it, but is unsatisfying by itself.On another level the story is no better.  The Radch empire already had a bit of a British empire thing going on, and the planet in question is a tremendous producer of tea.  The station has an ethnic underclass living off the books and downwell there is an oppressed worker class on the tea plantations.  The local elite of course are utterly unable to see the problem.  Breq, who knows just a little bit about everything, jumps in and starts fixing everything.  The obvious problem there seems to have occurred to Leckie, hence regular rounds of oppressed folks reminding Breq she doesnt know much of anything about them.  But given the role of Mary Sue Breq has been given to play, they just come off as childish, kicking their heels at being made to take their medicine.Its unfortunate.  Ive long been an avid reader of fantasy and every other kind of speculative fiction, but Ancillary Justice was one of the books that finally sparked an interest in science fiction for me.  I hold out hope that Ancillary Mercy will capitalize on considerable potential.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MI8O9EDHGSEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8289A0#wasThisHelpful","R1MI8O9EDHGSEA","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rat Queens Volume 2 picks up with our hard-drinking, ill-behaved, all-female group of adventurers where Volume 1 left off.  With the Rat Queens recovering from their post-battle victory party hangovers.  But the real threat still looms.

"MILD SPOILERS THROUGHOUTAfter the devastating war between Negans faction and the Alexandria Safe-Zone and its allies that spanned two volumes, Volume 22 gave the series the chance to catch its breath.

"Hyperbolic title notwithstanding, Sprinkle isnt out to cut down Silicon Valley.  Rather, he wants to show how much is happening outside of SV (and Boston) in cities less known for their tech startup scenes, like Detroit, NYC, Las Vegas, Austin, Kansas City, Raleigh, and Boulder, each of which gets a chapter.  SV is still the kingit accounted for over half the largest startup exits over the past couple of years, and well more than New York, Massachusetts, Southern California, and Illinois combinedbut there is more and more happening elsewhere.  Each of those elsewheres has its own culture and strengths and weaknesses.DETROIT.  The focus is on the urban core, driven by the billionaire founder of Quicken Loans, Dan Gilbert.  (Wrong I think, to criticize Detroit for needing private police forcespolice have always been private in large part.  Conversely, he doesnt touch on how difficult it is to start a business in Detroit, one of the common criticisms of a bankrupt Detroit that still put its faith in big public spending projects rather than small businessmen.)NYC.  The Big Apple ranks only behind SV and Boston in terms of metro areas by VC investment.  Where others see the challenges, NYC entrepreneurs see the opportunities, including in Brooklyn, which by itself has outpaced almost every other large startup area in the country.  And should we be surprised there is ample opportunity in the center of the finance, media, fashion, and advertising worlds?  NYC has the advantage of being better integrated into the larger economy than SV.LAS VEGAS.  Casinos are king there and it shows.  A major hurdle is lack of office space due to construction focus on hotels and casinos, leading to tight commercial real estate market and thus expensive rents.  But Vegas is also home to one of the largest, most secure and efficient data centers in the United States (protected by armed commandos).  Its very compact compared to SV and several of the others.  The west coast location, but with much better cost of living and business climate compared to California is a big plus.  But it is still recovering from a 90s tech scene laid waste to by the dot-com crash.AUSTIN.  [T]he Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos, Texas metro area has generated more jobs in technology fields than any other region in the country since 2001, including the Bay Area.  Tech employment in Austin is up 41 percent in that time, and the number of local workers in STEM fields . . . is up 17 percent.  One in a quarter Austin workers in the tech sector, and Austin is expected to produce one in five tech jobs in Texas.  Austin may be the fastest growing city in America.  Its affordable and business friendly, but also trendy, in a way that the other areas other than NYC and Boulder are not.  Austins Big 4 are: UT, the state capitol, the Austin City Limits music festival, and SXSW.  Its described as a big-time tech scene with small-town values.  It bought its way into the big-time, as is the Texas way, but has a nagging sense it could lose it all, as is the Texas way.KANSAS CITY.  The start-up scene is centered in a row of houses along the state line (on State Line Road) because of the presence of Google Fiber.  Indeed, its an old telecom center (e.g., Sprint) owing to prime location in the middle of the country, and it was a rail center before that.  Kansas City has a lot of old tech and a long history of entrepreneurship but not seed funds and no real VC.  Its very Midwestern in its values and view of the world.RALEIGH.  The Raleigh-Durham area is home to three research universitiesDuke, UNC-CH, and N.C. Statebut its the public engineering school that gets referenced most often.  It is also home to the Research Triangle Park (RTP), the largest science- and technology-focused research park in the world (40,000 daily workers).  The scene in Raleigh-Durham goes way beyond tech startups to all STEM fields (the materials science program at N.C. State gets a shout-out).  There are big-name anchor companies like IBM, BASF, GlaxoSmithKline, and Intel, plus startups done good like Red Hat and SAS.  Its a top 10 region for VC investments.  But its a surprisingly diffuse scene, with the real action in the tech startup world away from N.C. State and RTP in Durham (the location of N.C. State notwithstanding).  The low cost of living comes up (again).  The area is much richer in talent than a lot of the others, thanks to the aforementioned research universities.  The scene didnt disappear post-dot-com crash as in some of the others because of diversification, e.g., there was life science to pick up the slack.  It gets poor marks for a tendency not to think big, a surprising funding gap, and because RTP is starting to look a bit old-fashioned, a suburban corporate park when urban centers are the rage.BOULDER.  Boulder is taking two out of five of tech funding dollars in Colorado.  Its a place where people connect on bike rides and a place that the people there love.  Boulder is the smallest city on the list, but still has a Google, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, and HP presence.  It also has CU and a big government science presence.  It has the highest percentage of work-from-home residents in the U.S and what is described as a Karma economy.  Boulder is the main scene, but nearby Denver is important too.  On the downside, it is ethnically un-diverse enough to be a drag on recruiting engineering talent.  But it is welcoming to outsiders.Disclosure: I received a free copy through NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22645P76WIE38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PIX9VSG#wasThisHelpful","R22645P76WIE38","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By the People is Charles Murrays answer to what to do about a regulatory state metastasized and gone mad (if you disagree about that its probably best to start elsewhere).  And what he recommends is not to act through the traditional democratic channels, but to instead engage in what he calls systematic civil disobedience.  It meets the dictionary definition, but it is not civil disobedience as we generally think of it, nor is it necessarily that different than some of the pushback against the State already going on, albeit on a larger scale.  Well get to that.Murray divides By the People into three parts.  Part I covers how we got to where we are at the end of the American project as the founders intended it and why the normal political process will not rescue us.  Part II outlines the particular sort of civil disobedience that Murray recommends.  Part III takes a look at the various reasons, e.g., demographic, cultural, why Murray thinks now is an especially apt time for change.  He sees a broad market for what hes selling and uses the term Madisonian throughout to refer to classical liberals, libertarians, and conservatives (and presumably conservatarians) who generally agree that government should be limited.  And he is preaching to the choir; this is a call to action, not a call for conversion.Part I breaks down the problem into discrete areas, first describing what went wrong and then making the case as to why it cant be fixed through the normal democratic process.  For example, the chapter titled A Broken Constitution starts with a short history of the New Deal Courts abandonment of a federal government limited to its enumerated powers.  It ends by arguing that reversing the key decisions just discussed will never happen.  For example, reversing Helvering would require the federal government to end Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, all welfare programs, all spending on K-12 education and more.  If it were enforced it would throw the country into chaos and the Supreme Court would never do it.  Murray also covers lawlessness of the legal system as a whole (due to the huge cost of civil litigation, the abandonment of the requirement of a guilty mind in criminal law, etc.), the extralegal regulatory state, a systematically corrupt legislature (the sort of corruption requiring campaign contributions to get anywhere with legislation), and institutional sclerosis.Part II addresses what to do about it, assuming that Murray is correct that the normal democratic processes will be inadequate.  It advocates systematic civil disobedience.  That civil disobedience, though, mostly means people continuing to do what they did before, invariably running afoul of one regulation or another from time to time, only now with a privately funded legal resistance.  That legal resistance would take two forms.  The first is a legal defense fund that he calls the Madison Fund, much like a Pacific Legal Foundation or Institute for Justice but on a much larger scale and specifically focused on protecting against government overreach of a certain sort.  The second is insurance against government funded by industry groups (this idea doesnt get as much attention).  These would first and foremost defend ordinary individuals against government overreach, even if it accomplishes nothing else.  But Murray also wants to make large portions of the Code of Federal Regulations de facto unenforceable.  Murray goes on to spend quite a bit of time on the nuts and bolts, laying out categories of regulations that should not be candidates for civil disobedience and giving principled and practical decision rules for choosing regulations to ignore.  Defense against a regulatory action would be both legal and in the public square.Part III is when things fall apart a bit.  Which is funny, because Part III is where Murray finally returns to his wheelhousesocial science.  He runs through several findings that I take it are to provide support of Murrays argument that the time is now, but it doesnt come through forcefully.  Its still wonderful stuff, though.  Murray points out that weve always been a pluralistic society with at least as much of a cultural gulf among the original four groups that settled America (he owes a lot to and explicitly discusses Albions Seed here) as among the various groups in America today.  It was the period from the 1950s to the 1970s that was anomalous.  He points out that a significant portion of Americans still live in small towns or small cities where local government remains relatively personal, effective, and light (only 28% of Americans live in urban areas of more than 500,000 people).  Technology offers new opportunities to evade burdensome, protectionist regulations (Uber is a case study).  He adds an argument at the end that the Left should give up on public sector unions, the Right should give up on eliminating transfer payments, and both sides should reject their cultural absolutists (progressives and (some) social conservatives, respectively).  In doing so he makes a perceptive, and overlooked, distinction between progressives and left-liberals.  There is also a one paragraph description of our civic religion that rivals W.J. Cashs summation of the South in The Mind of the South for nailing the mores of a people in just a few words.Im not entirely sold, though.  Murray very early on asserts that the answer is not electing the right politicians or getting the right judges appointed.  But his plan looks less like traditional civil disobedience than it looks like conservative legal activism over the past few decades.  His Madison Fund admittedly looks a lot like existing groups like the Pacific Legal Foundation and the Institute for Justice, only on a much larger scale.  As in several hundred million dollars a year versus $25 million a year for the existing groups combined.  When groups like that are already doing such great work, what is the basis for funding on a much larger scale for a new group?  And despite Murrays dismissal of seeking change through the courts, his plan for the Defense Fund assumes just that.  First, a major change in the level of scrutiny courts give enforcement actions is a bigger deal than fighting enforcement actions on an individual level.  That kind of change requires first and foremost the sort of intellectual credibility conservative and libertarian attorneys and academics have been building on a number of issues over the past few decades.  Murray really seems to be relying on a change in law and not what the term civil disobedience suggests to me, which is to leave the regulations and enforcement options intact but effectively useless because of the scale of violation.  Rather than spend time on how things play out if there is no sea change in the law, Murray relies on such a change.  That isnt crazy.  Legal positions that were considered crazy by most of the academy, such as the Second Amendment as an individual right and the Commerce Clause having any constraining principle, were resurrected because judges have to show their work and in the law reasoning and principles really do matter.  Sackett v. EPA was huge, important win.  But its a daunting road.  The Supreme Courts most vocal proponent of Chevron deference, after all, is Justice Scalia.Changing the law would require principled argument, but it would also require principled judges.  Murray is wrong to dismiss the importance of who is elected president for that reason alone.  But perhaps more importantly, the president can have enormous influence over the regulatory state through his veto pen and as head of the executive branch.  The institutional sclerosis Murray so vividly paints a picture of is real.  But who would argue, when it comes to wrangling the regulatory state, that Reagan was not preferable to both Bush the elder and Bush the younger?  Or even that Clinton was preferable to Obama?  Public choice principles might suggest any president will be loath to devolve any power from the executive branch, but I think it is feasible because so little of the power of the regulatory state is really at the hands of the president (in stark contrast to our military and foreign policy apparatus).  Congress is a lost cause, but the presidency has the potential to counterweight Congress inherent foibles in this area as it so often has on trade.Further, I dont think Murray spends enough time considering the threats of blowback and a regulatory state that proves more entrenched than expected.  For example, look at the prohibition of drugs, especially marijuana.  The American people have practiced a sort of civil disobedience in that large numbers of Americans ignore drug laws and continue to use drugs.  But for decades the federal governments response was to double down again and again on drug prohibition and to encroach on its citizens civil liberties in more and greater ways.  The courts facilitated, rather than impeded, this response.  Prosecutors and criminal courts found a way to handle huge case loads.  States even began to retreat from harsh enforcement of drug laws (again, especially marijuana) without the federal government beating a similar retreat, although this may be beginning to happen (on a related note, Murray commits an egregious error of law in discussing state marijuana decriminalization by suggesting that because the federal government prohibits marijuana, states MUST also prohibit it; this is plainly wrong under current and correct federalism jurisprudence).  Murray does mention briefly in his conclusion that the efforts he recommends may further erode the legitimacy of the federal government.Murray is also more optimistic about our cultural readiness.  He points to our pluralism, noting that cultural pluralism has been the rule in America, not the exception, and he points to the decline of network television.  Hes right about that, but I still have my doubts.  The rise of the progressive faction on the Left has led to a rather shocking attempt to enforce cultural hegemony.  The rise of the Long Tail may actually make things worse, not better, leaving a few dominant media properties without an effective counterweight.  I see this seemingly every morning as the morning shows have found something new about which people are outraged.  How can we be ready for limited government when parents might get arrested if they let their kids walk home from the park alone?Finally, Murray doesnt consider the threat of another source of sclerosis.  Our enormous wealth.  Our government is largely a parasite, but its a parasite with a host unmatched in human historythe American economy.  When we remain so much richer today than yesterday, how will the problem of a kudzu-like regulatory state ever be sufficiently acute to take real action?  Good, after all, is often the enemy of great.But in many ways the above critiques are more a feature than a bug, because the book spurred me to think deeply about the issue.  It spurred me to rethink a lot of stuff that I had written off as inevitable.  And it spurred me to come back to the basic problem Ive always wrestled with as a libertarianhow do we get from where we are today to a basically free future?  Murray doesnt have all the answers.  But I think he has part of the answer.Disclosure: I received a copy of By the People through NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M2G984KU2DRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PBGM2#wasThisHelpful","R2M2G984KU2DRF","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a Spiderman and X-Men filled youth, I largely stopped reading comic books.  What little comic book reading Ive done since then has been mostly The Walking Dead with a few other Image Comics thrown in.  So Ms. Marvel is my first foray back to Marvel (the real stuff, not that talkie stuff the kids are into these days).  I will be back.You see, Ms. Marvel is really, really damn good.  Ms. Marvel returns to ground well trod by comics: the immigrant experience (Superman); gangly, gawky teenage years (Spiderman); and being the Other (X-Men).  But it remains fertile ground when done well, and Ms. Marvel is exceedingly well done.  Not in the big ways of great action set pieces or an epic storyline, because at the very least we havent had time to get there, but in the little ways.  All of them, from Ms. Marvel trying to control her new powers to simple moments between a frustrated, loving father and a teenage girl outgrowing the nest.The teen girl is Kamala: a young, Pakistani-American girl.  A more devout female friend (Nakia) and brother, a more Americanized male friend (Bruno) (and love interest?), a mean girl (Zoe), long suffering and hardworking immigrant parents round out the main cast for now.  The rebellion comes early when Kamala sneaks out to go to a high school party where she has her first sip of booze.  It ends like it ended for most of us, with an encounter with a terrigen bomb that activates her Inhuman genes.  (You might not understand any of that any more than I did; its ok, you dont really need to because the comic doesnt much concern itself with the source.)  The result is Kamala gaining powers; that is, the power to manipulate her bodyboth to do stuff like create giant fists and to make herself gigantically huge or ridiculously tinyand a healing factor.Like I said, the story doesnt start with a bang, but the volume sets up a Big Bad, someone named the Inventor with suitably villainous inventions.  But Kamala starts by pulling girls out of the lake and foiling convenience store robberies.  Which is good, because we get treated to wonderful scenes of Kamala trying to control her powers and repurposing a burkini as a superhero costume.  And of course all that little stuff, including not just the two-way tension between being a superhero and being a normal teen, but the three-way tension among a stricter faith, mainstream American consumerism, and immigrants striving for the American Dream.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MX7K06X68JYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078519021X#wasThisHelpful","R2MX7K06X68JYP","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Volume 3 of Saga continues the story of star-crossed lovers from enemy peoples caught in an endless, bitter war, with a step up in quality from the first two (already good) volumes.  Back are ram-horned Marko and insect-winged Alana, along with their as-dangerous-as-an-idea child, Markos mother, and a ghost babysitter with no lower body; freelancer The Will and Markos ex-fiance Gwendolyn, along with a rescued child sex slave and a Lying Cat; and the TV-headed prince of the robot kingdom.  Newcomers include a pair of blue and green tabloid reporters and the writer D. Oswald Heist, briefly introduced at the end of the last volume.Things start off slow.  We step back to see what happens before the robot prince arrives at Quietus, The Will et al. are temporarily sidelined on a planet more dangerous than it appears while he gets his ship repaired, and we get a new storyline of the tabloid reporters looking into Alanas story.  Its good stuff in the interim, though (more on that in a bit), and things come to a head and get action packed as everyone converges toward the end of the volume.Saga has always had two central threads running through it: parenthood and war.  And it has always dealt with the former much better than the latter.  The addition of Heist who, along with Markos mother, acts as a wise, grandparently foil to Marko and Alanas young persons foolishness, is welcome.  And this volume thankfully rarely ruminates on war (with one notable exception, which makes up for it with utter ridiculousness).","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BT203E2UTB74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607069318#wasThisHelpful","R3BT203E2UTB74","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a book that is really about China and India, specifically the parts bordering Burma, not Burma.  It is a mixture of travelogue and current events.  It strives for balance between the two, but as it goes to modern involvement and influence in Burma, it is perhaps wishful thinking to give equal footing to India beside China.  The real value of the book is in digging into the respective Indian and Chinese border provinces, both quite distinct from the main.  The greatest weakness is that it comes too soon, on the cusp of Burma opening up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UJ333J3N2BOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005J4EWS8#wasThisHelpful","R1UJ333J3N2BOB","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book copy doesnt say it.  The Amazon editorial reviews dont say.  The title only hints at it.  Let me be clear then: this book only covers John Quincy Adams early life, omitting his presidency entirely and ending before his service as secretary of state in the Monroe administration.At 27, John Quincy was a world traveler and remarkable linguisthe spoke not only French and Dutch, but at one time or another studied Italian, Spanish, German and Russian, apart from reading and translating Latin and Greek.Levin focuses on John Quincys early life, mostly abroad in various diplomatic roles.  We see his famous anti-slavery sentiments as early as, and influenced by, his pre-adulthood travels in Russia.  We see mainly a diplomatJohn Quincy was never happy as a lawyer and unwilling to accept the learning curve.  Why would he when he had achieved so much so young?  We see the original maverick, abandoning the Federalists for the Republican Party.  Unfortunately, Levin doesnt seem particularly interested in the switch, and it is presented as something that just sort of happens.  We see one of the first great Constitutionalists, convinced the annexation of Louisiana was unconstitutional, although he turned down an appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States.A lot of attention is paid to his relationship with his wife.  She comes away poorly, and we come away with the impression that Levin disagrees with how prior popular historians have interpreted the relationship.  But then Levin makes statements like She was above all, and admittedly so, the victim of her own towering and enduring aspiration to nurture John Quincys candidacy for president without ever saying anything else in support of the notion.This is very much a biography, not history masquerading as biography.

"Who Fears the Devil? is a wonderful collection of short stories by Wellman about John, known elsewhere but not in the stories as Silver John and John the Balladeer.  The stories owe much to Appalachian folklore, people, and the place itself, Wellmans setting.  Wellman nails the voice of the region like only Ron Rash seemingly can.  He doesnt inexplicably pepper his dialogue with extraneous apostrophes.  Nor does he condescend or reinvent the regions people to reflect outsider stereotypes.  The stories are old-fashioned, and two things matter above all: a good heart and the power of silver.  The stories are standalonessometimes events from earlier stories are mentioned but they are also sometimes forgotten entirely and never are necessary to follow the latter story.  They are also of very consistent and high quality and very shortleading to an impressive collection for the money.This is an edition from Paiso publishing titled, in full, Hidden Worlds and Ancient Mysteries Planet Stories, The Complete Tales of Silver John, Who Fears the Devil?, presented by (and with an introduction from) Mike Resnick (2010).  The stories are, in order: Johns My Name; O Ugly Bird!; The Desrick on Yandro; Why Theyre Named That; Vandy, Vandy; One Other; Then I Wasnt Alone; Call Me From The Valley; The Little Black Train; You Know the Tale of Hoph; Shiver in the Pines; Find the Place Yourself; Walk Like a Mountain; Old Devlins Was A-Waiting; The Stars Down There; On the Hills and Everywhere; Blue Monkey; Nine Yards of Other Cloth; Trill Costers Burden; I Cant Claim That; The Spring; Who Else Could I Count On?; Owls Hoot in the Daytime; Nobody Ever Goes There; None Wiser for the Trip; Can These Bones Live?; Where Did She Wander?; Nary Spell; Sins Doorway; and Frogfather.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U1TJ13XCRMMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601251882#wasThisHelpful","R3U1TJ13XCRMMW","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Crimson Campaign is book two in Brian McClellans Powder Mage Trilogy.  Its not perfect, but it does establish that the promise McClellan shows in Promise of Blood was no fluke.  Tamas finds himself with a small army cut-off in hostile territory, Taniel Two-Shot has to deal with both the events of the last book and what his fathers absence means for him, and Inspector Adamat seeks to rescue his wife.The Crimson Campaign continues to do what Promise of Blood does so well.  The action is phenomenal, as is the plot, dialogue, pacing, and world-building.  The world-building, in particular, finds solid ground between stagnating and exploding.  My only complaint there, and my biggest complaint for the book, is that it seems to back off the philosophical implications of an Enlightenment fantasy.  My other complaint, such as it is, is that Tamas and Taniels plots are so strong the others suffer in comparison.  We do get a major clue into the mystery behind the revolution and some of the events of Promise of Blood, and I will be waiting with no little excitement for The Autumn Republic, the final book in the trilogy (I hope McClellan returns to the world).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U413FBWRI0T0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO7FI36#wasThisHelpful","R1U413FBWRI0T0","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Valour and Vanity is the fourth book in Kowals Jane-Austen-with-magic Glamourist Histories.  It may be the strongest yet.  Kowal continues her practice of telling a different type of story with each successive book.  This time its a caper, and Kowal pulls it off marvelously.Fresh off the traumatic events of Without a Summer, Jane and Vincent take an opportunity to get out of England and travel Europe a bit.  They are particularly interested in working with the great glassmakers in Venice.  This is a much appreciated return to the glamour in glass that gave the second book its name.

"The film version of No Country for Old Men is perhaps my favorite movie, and I long avoided reading the book in favor of exploring the rest of McCarthys oeuvre so this review will naturally focus first on comparing the book to the film, second to comparing it to the rest of McCarthys work, and last on the book as it stands alone.Overall, the Coen brothers adaptation is remarkably faithful.  They hew closely to the plot of the book, lift or seemingly lift a good bit of dialogue, and capture the imagery of it (and imagery has always been a great strength of McCarthys).  The primary divergence is in what they cut, and that has effects that ripple beyond the scenes themselves.  Sheriff Bells monologues are longer and more frequent, and more overtly political.  Bell also gets a backstory that emphasizes an important point (two, really) to his character that gets downplayed in the film.  That, combined with not playing hide-the-ball with an important scene the way the film does, makes clear that Bell is the real protagonist.  The film is funnier, but the book is still surprisingly funny for such a dark story, and Llewelyn Moss gets to deadpan snark at length in a plot thread omitted entirely from the film.  That, combined with a different final confrontation, leaves Carla Jean (and Llewelyn) humiliated by the whole affair.  Llewelyn also comes off as more foolish.McCarthy has been compared favorably to Faulkner and Melville, but hes been drifting steadily away from his Faulknerian roots over time.  No Country for Old Men is far more accessible than his Border Trilogy is far more accessible than Blood Meridian is far more accessible than The Orchard Keeper.  McCarthy has managed that losing only little of the potent imagery of his prose and his beautiful descriptions of work (the most Melvillian of writing).  Anton Chigurh is terrifying in his implacability, but doesnt approach the eldritch horror of Judge Holden in Blood Meridian.  Bells pessimistic view of a Texas-Mexico border drenched in blood and drugs rings hollow against the events of the Border Trilogy, let alone Blood Meridian (the film strips out or gives away much of that pessimism, while retaining a strong counterpoint, giving a stronger overall impression that the problem is Bells age).  Mexicans are regularly present in the story but never in the forefront; thus we miss the juxtaposition of the violence and kindness in Mexican culture that make so apt for McCarthys study (as rural, southern Appalachia did before).  Its hard to judge No Country for Old Men against McCarthys other books.  It didnt stay with me the same way the others did, but seeing the film first might be to blame for that.  It has the best pacing and plot yet, but thats never what makes a McCarthy novel great","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18WXBQ9H9QMPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WJSB4Q#wasThisHelpful","R18WXBQ9H9QMPY","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Half a King is Joe Abercrombies first book marketed as Young Adult.  It was also my introduction to Abercrombies work.  Its easy to see why he is so popular.  He displays an easy skill with the technical aspects, both at the micro and macro levels.  The prose flows through placid waters, rapids, and waterfalls alike.  The characters are rich, even if only briefly seen, and both the early, minor and later, major twists well structured.  Im not sure a YA title is the best introduction to an author so closely associated with grimdark though.  That aspect seems to be missing.  I will certainly be exploring Abercrombies other work though.Half a King is the story of Yarvi, the younger son of the king of land in a place that very much resembles Viking-era Scandinavia.  He succeeds to the throne after his father and elder brother are killed, thereby the king.  The half comes from his deformitya crippled arm and handthat marks him as unsuitable to his countrymen.

"James Monroe natural suffers in comparison to his predecessors, who each tower above him in one form or many (even if not necessarily in merit as president).  Monroe gets somewhat unfairly lumped in with the Founding Fathers, but he was much younger than Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison (albeit only a year younger than Hamilton).  He has a somewhat shorter (or at least less interesting) early career, which is thankful given Cunninghams format.Squeezing a presidency into not only a single volume, but a short one, Cunningham covers Monroes pre-presidential life and career in well under 30 pages, and similarly gives short shrift to his personal life, including, notably, his relationship with his wife and his slave ownership.That allows Cunningham the space, however, to passably address the major events of Monroes presidency.  Monroe juggles a prickly General Andrew Johnson and a decaying Spain during the war that led to the annexation of Florida.  We see a president working hard behind the scenes to bring Virginia to a compromise on slavery on the territories, apparently driven by national-interest (Cunningham isnt interested in playing amateur psychologist).  Cunningham shows how Monroe struggled to get anything done without a viable opposition to hold his party together.  He gives Monroe perhaps too much slack for not perceiving a major recession during his presidency.Monroe is, of course, best known for the doctrine that bears his name.  Monroe, like Jefferson and Madison before him, served as Secretary of State before ascending to the presidency, and he played an active role in foreign policy as president, often to the annoyance of his very able Secretary of State John Quincy Adams.  And while Adams was a major contributor to the Monroe Doctrine, it was truly Monroes.  Most interesting is just how anti-colonial it originally was.  Jefferson and other proponents saw it as, unfortunately, relinquishing possible future claims to Cuba and Texas (Monroe still envisioned a United States that stretched to the Pacific).  It wasnt that important at the time (Great Britains was the real opinion that mattered), but in retrospect it marked a turning point.  It was also notable for being rooted in principle.  Colonialism was wrong because, as Adams put it, people were entitled to Liberty and Independence.Overall, we get an effective portrait of a presidency.  Monroe doesnt measure up to his predecessors, but its hard not to come away from the book without thinking he was a very good president.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VJB9F55YN82I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0700607285#wasThisHelpful","R2VJB9F55YN82I","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hoyland (or his publisher) chose a funny name for Hoylands book on the Arab conquests.  So much of Hoylands thought-provoking and groundbreaking book downplays the role of religion and Islam.  Any historian of the birth of Islam and the Arab conquest faces a basic problemessentially all of the Arabic sources were written two centuries later.  Hoyland adopts a sensible response that is otherwise avoided, I assume, due to academic siloing and language barriers.  That is, he consults contemporary, non-Arabic sources.These are frequently Christian sources, but another major theme of Hoylands work is that religious differences were not as important then as centuries later.  Early Muslims tended to divide the world between adherents of Abrahamic religions and pagans.  The Middle East of the time was pluralistic.  Certain unorthodox Christian sects had been persecuted by the orthodox and welcomed a more forgiving Arab rule.  Later Islamic sources see only Muslims and infidels, Persians and Turks; Christian and other contemporary sources show a rich tapestry of religions and ethnic groups.  Islam only broke away from the more narrow Judeao-Christian focus after east Iran/Transoxania provided a majority of the troops who would overthrow the Umayyad dynasty in AD 750.Hoyland pushes back against the idea that the Arab armies sprang forth from a desert nowhere.  Arab tribesmen had been serving in the armies of Byzantium and Persia in large numbers in the fifth and sixth centuries.  It is true that nomadic Arabs played an important role in the conquering armies (nomadic people can produce roughly twice the soldiers per capita) but there were a number of Arabs living in cities in the Levant and much of the early Arab armies were drawn from Yemen, which had been civilized for centuries.  The Arabs were exposed not only to the Byzantine and Persians but also Ethiopians and Indians.Hoyland also pushes back against the idea that the Arabs deserve all the credit for toppling the Persian Empire and crippling the Byzantine one.  The Byzantine and Persian empires had conspired for their own demise through over a century of costly war.  Those empires also suffered heavily from a plague that didnt hit the more dispersed Arabs as hard.  The Arabs co-opted a long tradition of cutting agreements with conquered peoples to respect life, property, and customs in return for submission and tribute.Hoyland redefines the role of Islam.  Islam was not the all-important factor as it is sometimes treated, but it played a key role.  It helped the Arabs develop the strong organization necessary to conquer and govern their large empire.  Islams initial tolerance distinguished it from Christendom and enabled Christians and Jews to make a substantial contribution to the intellectual life of the Islamic world.  Conversion only took place slowly (in part because more Muslims meant more diluted spoils), and non-Muslims formed the majority of the population of the Middle East for at least the first three centuries after the death of Muhammad.  It goes beyond the scope of the book, but of course it was religion that took Islam past the natural barriers and well-organised states that stopped Arab armies.  On the opposite side of the coin, the lack of an organized clerical hierarchy robbed the Arab Empire of a potential source of imperial support.Hoyland also redefines what it meant to be Arab at the time.  It was already applicable to a number of non-ethnically Arab people in the Levant in Muhammads time who spoke Arabic, and became in the Arab Empire a term like American, applied to people with very different roots, but who have shared cultural values and a common language.  The Arabicization led to a cultural boom as texts from other nation-states were translated into Arabic, studied, and made a part of the intellectual worldview of Islamic civilization.In discussing the decline of the Arab Empire, Hoyland covers geographic scope and exposure to nomads like the Turks and Mongols, but also touches on the vulnerability to climate fluctuations of the marginal, arid lands of much of the empire.  Thats not a point unknown the literature, I think, but one less prevalent in popular histories.The bulk of the book, which concerns the conquests themselves, suffers from sparse source material.  Without accounts of tactics and weaponry employed, it inevitably turns into a tiresome string of dates and names.  The section on the Islamicization and Arabicization of the Middle East doesnt suffer the same weakness and is much stronger.  This is a book from an academic publisher, but it doesnt read like it.  Hoyland addresses scholarly dispute without robbing the story of its narrative force.Disclosure: I received a free, advance copy through NetGalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OGXQ8ODOFAFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4CK12A#wasThisHelpful","R2OGXQ8ODOFAFC","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just a few years ago, I did not know who the Kurds were.  The Kurds play only a supporting role in Middle East history, and that largely hidden (who knew Saladin was a Kurd?).  The Kurds probably first appeared in American news when they suffered Saddams chemical terrorism.  They resurfaced when the US invaded Iraq again.  Joe Biden suggested splitting Iraq in three, giving the Kurds their own polity, but like most things Joe Biden says, people didnt give it much credence.  The Kurds reappeared as defenders of northern Iraq against ISIS, giving a much better showing than the Iraqi army.The Miracle of the Kurds is mostly popular history with ample personal anecdote thrown in.  Mansfield did aid work in Kurdistan and later came to know a number of Kurds who fled to, of all places, Nashville, Tennessee.  He returned to find a very different Kurdistan after explosive economic growth post-Saddam.Why did the Kurds prosper when the rest of Iraqs challenges are so well documented?  We can started with the Investment Law of 2006, in which foreign investors granted equal status to indigenous investors, given large tax breaks, and given full rights of ownership and profit.  Its basic economics but nonetheless an unpopular approach around the world.  As Mansfield puts it, [a]s the new millennium dawned, Kurdish leaders took stock of their situation.  They had little to offer but land, rights, and freedom.  Kurdistan (like Texastan) has one of the lowest tax rates in the world.  Subsequently, Kurdistan has experienced economic growth rate vastly outstripping the rest of Iraq (which also has oil, it should be noted).So why?  What makes the Kurds so different?  As it turns out, the Kurds have a long and very difficult history.  Unofficial motto: The Kurds have no friends.  The Kurds themselves are more likely to say, we have no friends but the mountains.  3/5ths of Kurds are Muslim, but the Kurds due to geography and cultural intransigence never Arabicized so it is a particularly Kurdish version of Islam.  The Kurds are better on womens rights than most of the rest of the Middle East.  Saddam hated the Kurds and tried to wipe them out, using weapons chemical and conventional, and may have succeeded but for a no-fly zone enforced by the US and the western world.  They survived, and entered the post-Saddam era with a belief that they must protect themselves.Mansfield is unorthodox, to say the least, as a strong critic of the elder Bush limiting the scope of the first Iraq War.  Whatever the merits of that decision, the Kurds were abandoned by the US and they bled and died for it.  Today, theyve long since proven they deserve our full support.Disclosure:  I received a complimentary e-copy of The Miracle of the Kurds through NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R215N8JO4NI8HN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJ3W91O#wasThisHelpful","R215N8JO4NI8HN","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rebellion, which is evidently (I havent read the previous volumes) the third book in a history of England, covers not much more than a century.  But it was a very important century of English history, spanned by the rules of two Jameses, two Charleses, two revolutions (one normal, one glorious), and two Cromwells.  In the process Parliament firmly took a dominant position over the monarch and England finally came to grip with Protestant dissent.It was a period during which the last heretic was burned in England, the Thirty Years War took place on the Continent, Shakespeare wrote many of his plays, the First and Second Bishops Wars were fought in Scotland, the Star Chamber was abolished, publication of pamphlets and tracts exploded, English soldiers put on red coats, coffee and tea hit the scene, and Whig and Tory entered the parlance of the time.It is a period defined by the struggle between Parliament and King.  The King is forever dissolving or proroguing Parliament, and Parliament is forever denying the King funds and chastising him, and being chastised in turn.  We also see the beginnings of modern politics, with contested elections and parties.  The tension between military and legislature during the Protectorate presages much of 20th Century history in many countries.  The English Civil War was in part but not entirely a religious conflict, in part but not entirely a class conflict, and in part but not entirely a interregional conflict.  The idea that all power springs from the people appears, and England briefly has a written constitution.  A larger portion of the population perished than in WWI.I remain somewhat conflicted as to Ackroyds treatment of religion.  He sometimes makes statements downplaying its importance to the events covered that are contradicted by his own narrative.  But there was obviously much else going on, and Im left adjusting my view of the importance religion played downward.The role of the law and the debates over it recede in prominence to the narrative after Cokes time.  That has less to do with a change in the role law played than a drawback to Ackroyds approach, which tends to emphasize individuals.Rebellion cant by any measure be regarded as a cultural history, but Ackroyd touches on culture on a regular basis, for color if nothing else.  There is a distinct lean toward the bawdy.My (selfish) remaining complaint is that the English colonies are largely absent from the story.  This is unfortunate, for example, because of the effect events in England had on immigration patterns to America, which did much to establish a unique American culture.Disclosure:  I received a complimentary e-copy of Rebellion through NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FBVXQRXXWFR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J6TV0H8#wasThisHelpful","R3FBVXQRXXWFR6","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zubulakes e-discovery is the story of Laura Zubulake, the plaintiff in the landmark series of opinions on discovery of electronically stored information.  Zubulake worked as an investment banker on Wall Street, and UBS fired her after she filed a complaint with the EEOC complaining of gender discrimination.  After a long lawsuit featuring hard-fought wrangling over discovery (the main focus of the book and the suits claim to fame), Zubulake won big at trial and settled on the courtroom steps (albeit on the way out instead of in).Over the course of four written opinions, the Court replaced the old Rowe benchmark with a new, seven-factor test.  This was just the opinions of one district court, but they were published opinions by a district court judgenot magistratein the most influential district in America, the Southern District of New York.  The Zubulake standards are now widely used across the nation.That describes the most important holding from the Zubulake opinions (to be closely followed by the standards for spoliation and adverse inference), but why read this book instead of the opinions?  Zubulakes e-discovery suffers in comparison.  The collected opinions are shorter.  Zubulake gives the important points from each opinion; but those arent exactly hidden in the opinions themselves.  In fact, the Zubulake opinions are very well written as judicial opinions go.  Zubulakes writing isnt bad, but, promises to tell her personal story aside, she makes the fatal error of stripping every possible personal detail from it.  The prose left is dull and lifeless.Zubulakes e-discovery is probably most valuable as a window inside a clients mind.  A brilliant, stubborn mind.  She makes the mistake of thinking that because employment discrimination isnt novelit forms a decent chunk of any federal judges docketthat it must be routine.  She mocks the proposed mock trial on the basis that there was nothing to test, apparently forgetting that fallible humans who could use the practice would be arguing her case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GHTFAZF4HZO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008X76BX2#wasThisHelpful","R3GHTFAZF4HZO8","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best thing that can be said about Browns new biography of Tolkien is also the worst: it is very short.  192 pages (in paperback) isnt much room to tell the story of anyones life, let alone Tolkiens.  I havent read a book on Tolkienother than Tom Shippeys masterful Author of the Centurysince I was in school, but Brown doesnt seem to cover any new ground.  As is to be expected of a book from a Christian publisher, Brown gives ample attention to Tolkiens faith, but Tolkiens faith is hardly novel.  I did find the discussion of the trouble his mothers conversion (and his along with her) to Catholicism interesting; its the sort of thing its easy for a modern American to discount.  His friendship with C.S. Lewis is another expected focus, but despite the relative attention it gets the length of the book demands that it come off as cursory nonetheless.  Tolkiens crooked road to academiahe was initially a poor student because he spent all his time on Germanic languages rather than the Classics he majored inis another highlight; his actual career in academia is barely mentioned.  All in all, I enjoyed it and Im glad I read it, but if youre a hardcore Tolkien fan dont expect much, if anything, new.Disclosure: I received a complimentary e-copy of Tolkien via NetGalley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12KPF75T7AHTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630888060#wasThisHelpful","R12KPF75T7AHTP","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Color of Justice starts off in a familiar fashion, with an idealistic white attorney in small town Mississippi facing the choice whether to defend a black man accused of murdering a white woman.  (Ill skip over descriptions of athletic attorney, the supportive wife, the nurturing black mother figure, the wealthiest man in town, and the venal prosecutor because youve seen them before.)  Collins attempts to put a twist on things by continuing the story from 1964 in 2014.  The book jacket and this review must remain necessarily vague about the role that the 2014 story plays, but just be forewarned that it only shows up well, well into the book.  Its also very jarring and abrupt when it does, but I think that is by design and effective.The Color of Justice is anchored by awful, awful dialogue.  Which is a shame, because outside of the dialogue Collins does a great job dealing with issues that can easily come off as trite.  The legal drama is strong, and the aforementioned familiar character types surprise us frequently enough.  Collins is perhaps at his best in avoiding an overly simple narrative.  Our young, idealistic attorney is very close to just letting the whole thing pass.  The young black man accused of murder is angry.  The sheriff doesnt really think he did it, but like a lot of residents of the small town he just doesnt want to rock the boat.  The twist at the end, unfortunately, isnt much of a revelation and overall the book comes out as just average.Disclosure: I received a complimentary e-copy of The Color of Justice via NetGalley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LYZJVTK33SNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JS6D6LC#wasThisHelpful","R2LYZJVTK33SNM","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Plunder of Souls is D.B. Jacksons third book in the Thieftaker Chronicles (three and counting and no sign of slowing).  The Thieftaker Chronicles chronicle the adventures of Ethan Kaille, a thieftaker in 1760s Boston and a conjurer.  D.B. Jackson has a PhD in American History and is an accomplished fantasy author (as David B. Coe): both show.  In A Plunder of Souls, Kaille has been hired as by a local church to investigate a series of grave desecrations.  Its soon clear that something more sinister than mere grave robbing is afoot and that Kaille is in over his head.A Plunder of Souls gets off to an unfortunate start.  By book three, my default is the less Sephira Pryce, the better.  Ethan and Sephiras relationship begins to change during the book, though, and she winds up playing a different, more interesting, role here than in the first two books.  We also continue to see a more assertive Kaille, a welcome bit of character progression in the second book.Unfortunately, American history takes a back seat in book three.  The main historical event of note is a minor influenza epidemic.  Samuel Adams makes a cameo, but otherwise the Sons of Liberty are silent.  This is particularly disappointing after the second book.I do have one particular complaint about the ending.  Jackson makes a decision that I think is about future books, not this one and this one suffers for it.  It isnt going to stop me from waiting with anticipation for the next book, though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H1UGDVF6COLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXZZYCO#wasThisHelpful","R3H1UGDVF6COLN","A1LW3XGXYP98BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LW3XGXYP98BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I looked forward to reading Of Sorrow and Such because I really enjoyed Sourdough and Other Stories and The Bitterwood Bible, all of which take place in the same world.  Unfortunately, although Of Sorrow and Such is readable, it's overly derivative and logically weak.The main character, the witch Mistress Gideon (formerly Sykes), is always in some degree of peril. Witches are hunted by the church and then burned at the stake in the same villages where they have healed many neighbors with herbs and spells.  Once witch hunters arrive at the village of Edda's Meadow in search of Selke, another witch Mistress Gideon has secretly sheltered, not only they but several of the town's other women are in peril.  Because, although Mistress Gideon claims to be able to perceive whether anyone has magical ability, she's as surprised as everyone else to discover that some of her neighbors are shapeshifters. They even have a club with monthly meetings. Mistress Gideon has been routinely restoring a woman whose husband is trying to slowly poison her, believing no one else can help.  At a crucial moment near the end of the book, the woman's mother-in-law turns out to be a powerful witch eager to protect her daughter-in-law. And there are more deux ex machinas, plus an overly heavy-handed message that Men are Bad and Women Are Good and Support Their Sisters.If you're a Sourdough/Bitterwood fan, as I am, Of Sorrow and Such is worth reading.  But I hope any future works set in this world will be better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21R4Y7QRK9U9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765385260#wasThisHelpful","R21R4Y7QRK9U9K","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Protagonist Maia is the fourth and (and youngest) son of an emperor by his cast-off fourth (and last) wife.  When the book opens, Maias beloved mother has been dead for some years.  Maia was brought up in the back end of nowhere by his abusive distant cousin Setheris, who was exiled from court for some unproven treason. Maia has lived the life of an impoverished rural noble for all of his 18 years. He has received the minimum of education even for such a noble.All this changes at the very beginning of the book, when the courier Csevet brings the news that Maias father and three older brothers were killed in an airship accident. (Even though the novel takes place in some vague equivalent of the Middle Ages.) Maia is now the emperor. That is, if he can fight off several less legitimate, but much more aggressive and knowledgeable claimants who already live at court.  On Setheriss advice (he wants to use Maia to gain some important position) Maia immediately travels to court to claim his throne.Although part of The Goblin Emperor is about how Maia foils treacherous plots and investigates the deaths of his relatives (hint: not accidental), the main theme is how Maia gains what hes always lacked. Luxurious rooms, clothes, jewels, and meals are part of it, but Maias emotional needs are stronger. He wants relatives, and although most are dead he befriends most of the ones that are left, even his fathers cast-off first wife. He wants friends, and although he comes to realize that his position makes disinterested friendship impossible, he does gain the strong loyalty of a number of people, especially (most of) his bodyguards. Maia is childishly delighted to receive loads of fancy gifts for his 19th birthday, even though he realizes they are all from nobles who want something from him. He also adores being taken care of by his personal dressers/wardrobe people. More maturely, Maia does want to do good and make a difference, often an our-world politically correct difference regarding race, gender, or social class.I enjoyed this book, but I had some problems with it. First, Maia is several years younger emotionally than chronologically. Hes very passive, and constantly feels sorry for himself over events that happened years earlier. Im not sure if the age dissonance is intentional on the authors part, but the self-pity gets tiresome. One of Maias emotional needs is to cast off his practical dependence on Setheris, but he merely switches his dependence to other people as they volunteer to help.And there are aspects of world building where I just could not suspend my disbelief. In particular, the four imperial bodyguards, pairs of whom stay on duty 12 hours a day until the emperors death, when they all are sworn to commit ritual suicide so they can be buried with him. (Sarah Monettes work sometimes contains S & M aspects. Maia even voluntarily watches a treacherous bodyguard commit mandatory suicide, described in gory detail.) First, four bodyguards is not enough, if the real purpose is to have the emperor well guarded and not for the author to describe a kind of master-slave relationship. The several rival claimants to the throne and their numerous allies really want to kill Maia. Its hard to see how only two bodyguards (at any given time) could realistically defend him against a band of attackers. (Maia himself has no self-defense training.) Then, bodyguards who always work 12-hour days cant possibly be effective. (At the beginning, when only one pair has been hired, they stay on duty with no sleep for several days in a row; this while traitors lurk everywhere.) To be alert, bodyguards need to eat well and sleep well. They also need to regularly practice their skills for defending the emperor.  Its not clear whether these are swordplay, knife work, martial arts, or what (though half the bodyguards have some kind of magical skill), but Id assume theyd need to stay expert in several forms of defense. And last, if they are hired young and keep their jobs till the emperor dies of old age, they will be four old guys (well, since Maia is so PC, one bodyguard is female) defending another old guy.  Hardly effective, as in this society Id expect people to pass their physical peak by 40.The Goblin Emperor has its charms, and its certainly lighter than Sarah Monettes Doctrine of Labyrinths series. I just wish the author had thought it out more thoroughly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL9EMNP9TGVD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765365685#wasThisHelpful","RL9EMNP9TGVD3","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A History of Architecture in 100 Buildings has the limitations youd expect of a book that covers the entire world (though some parts more than others) and a vast historical range. Many famous structures (the author rather unfortunately did not limit himself to buildings) are omitted. (The author says one selection criteria is that he had to have seen the structure himself.) Although the descriptions are reasonably informative, they are all short (about 2  pages including photos).  The photos are rather small and scanty (few interiors, for one thing).  Although this book is no less flawed than a college class such as Introduction to the Worldwide History of Art, where the instructor displays so many famous paintings so fast the students can hardly keep track, its no better.  The scope of this book forces it to be superficial.Although Im not an architectural expert, I grew up near and have visited one of the famous buildings described in this book:  Frank Lloyd Wrights Fallingwater.  Author Dan Cruickshank says that one of the criteria for a great building is functionality. I agree. He admits that Fallingwater is flawed, in the sense that it was built with insufficient structural support (it had to be extensively retrofitted in a period from the mid 1990s into the early 2000s.) Thats a major problem right there. But other functional problems appeared much earlier. Local rumor had it that the family of department store magnates who commissioned Fallingwater donated it to the state of Pennsylvania because they found it impossible to use. Wright was a prima donna.  He could have placed the house near the falls, but chose to place it directly over them because, I was told, he felt the inhabitants would appreciate the view more if they had to intentionally go outside to look at it.  The downside was that the house was plagued with mold and leaks, as any sensible person might have anticipated. I was also told that Wright could have pigmented the huge concrete balconies so that they would never need repainting, but chose to require paint because he felt the inhabitants would appreciate the house more if they had to keep it up regularly.  As anyone who ever purchased a money pit can tell you, thats not true. Finally, Wright designed all the beds for short people because he himself was short and felt no one should be taller.  His clients were tall, so sleeping in the beds turned out to be difficult. The author doesnt mention any of these problems.This book should have been published as a large-format coffee-table book with big photos, that people could leaf through occasionally without expecting a thorough education in either world architecture or any specific structure.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MISZWUTDCKWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770855998#wasThisHelpful","R3MISZWUTDCKWO","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Home by Nightfall covers two cases tackled by 1870s gentleman detective Charles Lenox. A former MP, Lenox is now a partner in a London detective agency and determined to make it a success. A new case presents an excellent opportunity. A famous concert pianist has mysteriously disappeared, the newspapers are abuzz, and Scotland Yard is baffled. Unfortunately, family duty impels Lenox to leave the case to his partners and travel to his home town, Marketplace, to support his grieving, newly widowed brother Edmund. Lenox is like other fictional detectives in that wherever he goes, crime promptly occurs. A series of strange petty thefts is capped by the murder of Marketplaces mayor.  Of course Lenox is hired to investigate, aided by his brother. And of course both mysteries are solved.The marketing copy for this book enthusiastically declares it to be the equal of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen. Very different writers, but Ill let that pass.  The important point is that this is a pleasant cozy mystery with a mildly Victorian atmosphere and workmanlike prose.

"The United States Constitution stated that no ban could be placed on the importation of slaves till 1808.  Such a ban did go into effect in 1808, but the illegal slave trade continued for decades. No God But Gain is a study of the economic consequences of the illegal slave trade in the early 19th century, the period being seen as itself and not merely as a lead-up to the Civil War. This book shows how heavily the nation depended on the slave trade and how our Founding Fathers protected it and participated in it. The Monroe Doctrine, hubristic in its mention of both North and South America (the US had only 16 warships at the time) was created to protect the illegal slave trade.

"Made to Kill is a stylish noir detective novel, written in the style of Raymond Chandler and taking place in an alternate 1960s. Private detective Raymond Electromatic is the worlds last remaining robot. The brains of the operation is Rays office manager, the supercomputer Ada. Amoral Ada is increasing the firms revenues by having Ray moonlight as an assassin. Because he needs to have his data tapes transferred every night, when he reboots the next morning he has no memory of previous events. This complicates his investigations, but theres more:  Gold bars, beautiful women, famous actors, Cold War Russian spies, and Satanic rituals. Theres plenty of action, but this is not a thriller. Author Adam Christopher keeps the tone light, without the book ever becoming a spoof. Although the plot does have a definite end, this is the first book in a trilogy.

"Waltons previous book in this series, Superposition, resolves without any hint of a sequel, so I was rather surprised to see this one published. Like Superposition, Supersymmetry is a fast-paced, high-tech, near-future, hard science fiction thriller that aims to keep you on the edge of your seat for all 302 pages.  It largely succeeds, though readers not interested in physics may be slightly intimidated.  Its got a supervillain (the varcolac) same as in Superposition, which wants to destroy the world while the characters try to defeat it. This book begins about 15 years after the first book, with some of the same characters plus new ones added. The characters are pretty shallow, but we can all get behind the idea of saving the world. Techies will love all the gadgets, thriller fans will love the destruction the varcolac wreaks. Supersymmetry is not great literature, but competently and smoothly written. Although it resolves, I imagine that author David Walton could always manage to revive the varcolac at need.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW1DSR1VTP7DP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880982#wasThisHelpful","RW1DSR1VTP7DP","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These sponges have a scrub side and a mop-up side. The scrub side is *slightly* more abrasive than other scrubbers Ive used.  It works fine for getting off food stuck to cooking pots, but its not miraculous. You still have to use elbow grease. The sponge side is of average thickness, and treated with an antimicrobial coating so it wont smell funky. The shape of the combo is a kind of shortened hourglass, where you always have to grasp the combo on the same side, so its hard to get a new scrubbing area when an old one wears out. Overall, this is a useful basic kitchen scrubber. Its purple, if you care.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V00QPUKNO71I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100DOWKU#wasThisHelpful","R1V00QPUKNO71I","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Beautiful Bureaucrat is short, really a novelette. Thats the right length, because it might be hard to stick with its moody, surreal, bleak (but occasionally humorous) atmosphere for a longer stretch. A loving young couple, Josephine and Joseph, move from the hinterland to an unnamed city. Because theyre financially marginal (and want to have a child as well), Josephine accepts the worst data-entry job you can imagine. Not only does her boss have foul breath and tell her not to think, shes physically damaged and emotionally exhausted. Only one coworker, the oddly named Trishifanny, is willing to talk to her. Joseph also accepts a job, and Josephine has no idea what it is except that sometimes he doesnt come home and his cell phone messages are incomprehensible. But then events at work slowly begin to reveal whats really happening--which is impossible to explain without spoilers. Just dont expect this book to always make logical sense. Its all about ideas. And language; its beautifully written.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17I2W77EQHP9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627793763#wasThisHelpful","R17I2W77EQHP9K","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Uprooted is a comfortable, homey YA fantasy, reminiscent of Patricia McKillips work. Its predictable, but pleasantly so. The narrator/heroine Agnieszka lives in a vaguely Russian village at the edge of a sinister wood. Every ten years, the local sorcerer/lord known as the Dragon chooses a village girl to live in his tower. When their term is up, the girls come home educated and refined, with purses full of silver for their dowries.  They briefly visit their parents, then move to larger cities that have better opportunities. The chosen girl is always a local belle. While Agnieszka was growing up, everyone expected her best friend Kasia to be the Dragons next choice. Kasia is the most beautiful girl, and the most skilled in all the domestic arts (her parents made sure she was trained to serve a nobleman). No one expects the Dragon to choose Agnieszka, who is perpetually muddy and untidy, and whose only skill seems to be finding the unexpected, whether fruit out of season or more often, trouble.Of course, the Dragons choosing spell lands on Agnieszka. Once in the tower, Agnieszka discovers that the returning servants told the truth when they claimed the Dragon didnt molest them. However, Agnieszkas inability to cook, clean, or even dress neatly, coupled with her plain face and low social status, leads the fastidious Dragon to utter an endless stream of sarcastic comments typical of a certain kind of romance hero. Agnieszka also finds it very hard to learn even the simplest spells. (Interestingly, shes already literate.) But Agnieszka does have magical ability. Lots of it. Its just a *feminine* magical ability:  Organic, intuitive, inconsistent, largely nonverbal, nurturing, and cooperative. The only manual shes in tune with is a neglected handwritten journal by the long-dead witch Baba Yaga. Whereas the Dragons magic is masculine:  Logical, scientific, explicable, and tidy. It takes the Dragon awhile to understand and work with Agnieszkas ability, but he does.Agnieszkas talent for getting into trouble is also in full force.  By trouble, I mean politics, treachery, assassination, and war, which quickly lead Agnieszka back into the wider world, including the court, its royalty, and its experienced wizards. Here the 17-year-old Agnieszka is fully the awkward adolescentinsecure, socially inept, emotionally driven, and constantly bumbling around major political issues. However, her intense loyalty to her home village and to her friend Kasia, and her instinct for somehow figuring out the right thing to do, remain in force.Through all the books action. And there is lots of action. Uprooted is one of those books where the characters seldom eat or sleep but somehow, remain strong enough not to only keep their wits about them but to constantly work strong magic. Or for the lesser characters, just to kill people with swords and arrows. This book keeps you reading fast enough to ignore not only a certain amount of predictability in the plot, but a certain amount of shallowness in the characters. The author throws in a couple of female warriors but other than them (maybe even including them), weve met most of the characters before in other books by other authors.If youre looking for a fun, fast, light, fantasy read, check out Uprooted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DPXCI3HD58E4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804179034#wasThisHelpful","R1DPXCI3HD58E4","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read a number of Ms. Koval's Drylands stories in SF magazines and found them plodding and overly long for their plots.  So why did I buy *all* the volumes in the Glamour series to date and read them without any break except for short stories in SF magazines and nonfiction that I needed to read?  Probably because I'm always hoping for a genuinely good Austen follow-on and this wasn't the Drylands series.  And Im sure my dislike of Glamour in Glass is due to the cumulative effect of all the books.  But it took me many weeks to read this latest, a chapter at a time, looking for any excuse to do anything else by the end of the chapter.It's not just that the author tells but doesn't show.  She very carefully *explains* and *repeats* just in case the reader didn't get her points the first few dozen times.  The book opens with the author making sure the reader knows that in the previous volume, protagonist Jane, Lady Vincent had a miscarriage and now isnt sure if she can have children or even wants them, because if she had them she might not be able to continue her work.  I appreciate the effort to recap so the reader doesnt have to buy all the books.  But then, the author conscientiously works in these points every single chance she gets, throughout the book. Then, from previous books we know that Janes husband tends to overdo it when working glamour/magic, to the point of fainting and even on occasion to the brink of death.  His frailties, and Janes wifely admonishments not to overdo it, are constantly present. When Vincent collapses from exertion in yet *another* scene and Jane flutters round him *again*, and they have that wise little talk about marital control/cooperation yet *again*, I was going, no, please no, no, no, and put the book down yet again.  Then the glamour is a kind of ethereal weaving technique with the author constantly giving the names of the various knots, which are in a glossary, but who cares? Theres an awful lot of narrative consisting of Jane ties this knot, and then she ties another knot, and then her husband ties a knot, and on occasion other people tie knots, and then they tie them off. And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on.  Its exactly like reading a technical manual, except theres no chance of learning anything useful.Meanwhile, aside from all the potentially thrilling action being rendered insufferably tedious in this manner, the characters are cardboard.  Readers will probably know the two protagonists' handful of characteristics from previous novels, and these people dont develop any further.  Theres a stock villain with a stock financial motivation. The henchpeople barely register as people. Theres Lord Byron, and the author assumes everyone knows what hes like already. There are a number of characters who extensively aid the protagonists, but their motives are unclear and their personalities nonexistent.  It's impossible to emotionally engage with these books.Avoid this book. Avoid this series.  If youve been hoping it will improve, it doesnt.  Oh, and Jane's fertility issues look like they're intentionally being left open for resolution in yet another book. My speculation is that because the Vincents constantly discover ground-breaking techniques, they will discover how a female glamourist can be a wife and mother. Giving the author the opportunity to beat the reader around the head with yet more social education about how this is a good thing. Because that's another problem--the author seems to think marital happiness, women working, and social diversity are things no one else has ever heard of before, so readers all need to be carefully educated, and educated, and educated . . .","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22D5RZRJS1N33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765325616#wasThisHelpful","R22D5RZRJS1N33","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Thirteen-year-old Oliver Dalrymple (Boo), is a kid from a normal middle-class, Midwestern family. However, Olivers classmates dont consider him normal at all; they constantly torment him. Hes apparently leucistic (on the albino spectrum), and has Aspergers (on the autism spectrum). Hes also highly intelligent and deeply interested in science, which doesnt even endear him to his teachers. And he has a heart defect.Boo collapses in front of his school locker after, for the first time, faultlessly reciting the periodic table of elements hes striven to memorize. He wakes up in Town, which iswhat? a benign purgatory? A deitys science experiment? Its populated exclusively by American kids who died at the age of 13. (They wonder, are there other Towns for other demographics?) The kids live there for 50 years, without aging physically (though at least some age emotionally). Then they disappear towhere? Town mysteriously receives periodic deliveries of necessities, such as clothing and furniture, some of which look used/donated. And with strictly vegan food. But not with televisions, radios, and most other technology; nor does the library (to Boos sorrow) contain any science books. Some kids believe there are portals to the world of the living that they can use to visit their loved ones.Budding scientist Boo is eager to research all these questions. However, with encouragement from his counselor, long-time resident Mama Thelma Rudd, for the first time in his life he also makes friends. These include Johnny Henzel, a classmate who informs Boo that they both were shot by the same crazed murderer. Boo, Johnny, Thelma, and their friend Esther Haglund travel around Town to resolve the killers identity and at the same time, Towns other mysteries. And Boo records it all in a journal (this book) addressed to his beloved parents, hoping he can get it to them someday.

"The Vorrh has been praised as an astonishing book by no less than Alan Moore. Partly because it's not a Tolkien knockoff--but many excellent contemporary works of fantasy aren't, including Mythago Wood, which this book reminded me of. However, it is staggeringly inventive. The Vorrh is an imaginary forest first envisioned by early surrealist poet and playwright Raymond Roussel, whose poems include ""Impressions of Africa"" (and who is also a character in this novel). It's ancient, trackless, dangerous, and reputed to contain not only cannibals but the Garden of Eden. Victorian/Edwardian style colonists live at its edge.In addition to Roussel, fictionalized real-life characters include photographer Eadweard Muybridge (whose photos definitively viewed the motions of animals, but who suffered from double vision after an accident) and Sir William Gull, Queen Victoria's personal physician. Fully fictional ones include the cyclops Ishmael, who was raised by robots; Cyrena Lohr, a blind woman who regains her sight after a fling with Ishmael; and the Bowman, who has forgotten his own name.The plot of The Vorrh does not have a simple linear or chronological path. It's the first book in a trilogy, so the next two volumes may clarify matters. Author B. (Brian) Catling says he has completed them but I could find no publication dates. He's also written a quartet (I'm not clear if it's related to the trilogy), and several other unpublished novels. All this in addition to being a professor of fine art, a sculptor, and several other artistic careers. Yes. Astonishing. But getting back to The Vorrh, I wouldn't blame you if you held off till the other volumes are published and read them all at once.  It's very immersive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33IJXJ72OEW79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101873787#wasThisHelpful","R33IJXJ72OEW79","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Moon explodes suddenly, for no apparent reason, and deadly meteorite storms begin to pummel the Earth. Its inhabitants are faced with the prospect of their planet becoming uninhabitable in a couple of years. Pop scientist Dubois Jerome Xavier Harris is tasked with finding a solution. Space colonies?  Underground refuges? The world's nations set up a genetic ark in the International Space Station, but the station itself is struck by meteors, which annihilate much equipment, frozen embryos, and personnel.  The eventual survivors are the Seven Eves of the title, the mothers of future humankind.Thirty thousand years later, humankind is prospering in a ring of space habitats that orbit the Earth. The transformed Earth looks like a good place to establish a colony for some of the billions of people living in the habitats. What they don't know is that other humans survived in underground and undersea refuges. Their civilization is much less sophisticated than that of the space habitats, but they are already repopulating the Earth's surface.What with the time frame of 30,000 years and the length of 869 pages, SevenEves can only be called epic.  However, the abundance of action, intrigue, and science-fictional speculation kept me involved to the end of the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AYTUXY6E5BUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062190377#wasThisHelpful","R1AYTUXY6E5BUS","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So I just had to order a new player.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R229PLRRAUMUG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BI6MVS#wasThisHelpful","R229PLRRAUMUG1","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Superposition is told in two strictly alternating viewpoints, in chapters clearly labeled Up-Spin and Down-Spin (until the last chapter when all is neatly wrapped up). In the Up-Spin chapters, protagonist Jacob Kelley narrates his arrest and trial for the murder of Brian Vanderhall. Vanderhall was a brilliant but obnoxious physicist who continued to work at the (fictional) New Jersey Super-Collider after Kelley left to pursue an academic career. In the Down-Spin chapters, the Jacob Kelley of an alternate universe/timeline narrates his version of events. He frantically searches for the real killer and for his wife and children, who have disappeared and who may be dead.Alternate universes/timelines, complete with people meeting themselves, are so very popular in contemporary science fiction that little effort is usually made to explain the science. However, author David Walton (an engineer at Lockheed Martin) explains the science in great detail. The explanations are simple, but frequent and at times lengthy. They are carefully worked in. Vanderhall has developed applications/software for quantum physics that enable the characters to do pretty much anything (deflect bullets, teleport, you name it) whenever the plot requires it. Vanderhall was aided by quantum intelligences whose motives are mysterious but whose actions are sinister. Kelley's Romanian brother-in-law/sidekick Marek calls them varcolacs, folkloric demons that, according to Wikipedia, can be either vampires, werewolves, ghosts, or goblins. That seems accurate enough; strip away the quantum explanations and you have flexibly useful alien monsters. Even more improbably, Kelley's defense attorney presents the quantum explanations to a jury; for example, the point where Vanderhall was both dead and alive.The book is so action packed that you don't really notice all the plot's improbabilities till afterward, when you take a breath and think about them. It is, however, noticeable that the characters are very flat. Both Jacob Kelleys go through many horrendous experiences. They frequently claim they are emotionally devastated, but that's mostly the author telling rather than showing. The geeky joys of physics and the less geeky joys of thrilling action come off as much more important.Despite my weak physics background, I enjoyed Superposition more than most very hard science fiction. However, I don't recommend it to readers who insist on a character-driven novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10H3RTTVSUKKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880125#wasThisHelpful","R10H3RTTVSUKKW","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reimagined fairy tales  are by no means new, so the issue is whether A Wicked Thing reimagines Sleeping Beauty well.  You wont quite find out by reading this book, because it turns out to be only the first in a two-book series.In this half, Princess Aurora of Alyssinia has slept for a hundred years, to be awakened by a kiss from Prince Rodric of the current ruling family and the news that her swift marriage to him is being arranged by his parents, King John the Third and Queen Iris of Falreach. Aurora is in a very difficult situation. Her family and everyone else she knew are dead. (And hundreds of strangers have kissed her while she was asleep.) She doesnt know her fianc. He seems nice, but weak. He knows that they are being manipulated by his parents, who have strong political agendas. The kingdom of Alyssinia has been suffering under their reign and Auroras awakening is legendarily supposed to cure all its troubles. Other people with political agendas in which they want to involve Aurora include Tristan, a member of a revolutionary group whom Aurora meets in a tavern. (Aurora is virtually imprisoned in the castle, but manages to sneak out at night.) Then theres foreign Prince Finnegan, who urges Aurora to flee with him. (Somehow, the royal family lets him speak with her unsupervised.) Since Wicked Things is something of a romance, naturally Prince Rodric, Prince Finnegan, and Tristan all have their charms and are potential love interests.Not an easy situation for anyone to cope with.  But Aurora is unbelievably spineless, even by historical standards. Surely she noticed some palace and national politics going on in her precursed life?  Surely, as a princess, she was taught how to cope with them, how to be firm when necessary? Surely, as a princess, she would have been told she would probably have to marry a stranger for political reasons?The language of A Wicked Thing is lovely. However, the plot gives the effect of a work that started out as one book, then was padded and left without a strong ending to conform to a two-book contract. Many of the characters are fairly flat except for Aurora, who is annoying. I really wanted to love this book because I love fairy tale retellings.  Maybe the problem is that I'm too old for a YA book. But Ive seen Sleeping Beauty retold much better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34T3LK9ZPERZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062303538#wasThisHelpful","R34T3LK9ZPERZM","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found Women of Will to be a very annoying book. It's not a scholarly analysis of Shakespeare's plays. It's not a concerted look at Shakespeare's theatrical company, his life, his times, or really anything. It's an undisciplined ramble where if the author feels like throwing in any observation she just does it. So we have paragraphs like, ""The ways in which Shakespeare wrote about women fall roughly into five cycles. I call them five Acts because, odd as it may seem, the five cycles resemble the five-act structure in Shakespeare's plays. This leads me to ask, do our psyches develop over our lifetimes in five different movements (our minds, not our bodies; our bodies travel through the seven ages of man)--and is that why stories often have five phases?"" And assertions like, ""Many people think [Shakespeare's] sonnets are all conceit--all made up--there is no lover or beloved in life, only in imagination. But I don't buy it. If Shakespeare were not writing about life, he wouldn't be connecting so passionately to what he's saying."" It's fully credible that Shakespeare--a married man who had extramarital affairs with people of both genders--loved one or a number of them. This is just a thoughtless riff instead of any serious examination of Shakespeare's relationships or any attempt to find out who any of the sonnets are about.I don't recommend Women of Will unless you are such a major Shakespeare fan that you will read absolutely anything written about his work.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JVHE6591M9QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307700399#wasThisHelpful","R3JVHE6591M9QC","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have no children, but I like good moisturizing body washes so I decided to try this one. It washes my sensitive skin well without irritation. However, it is not suitable as a face wash because it should not get into the eyes. The container is rather small, but you don't need to use much at once. As usual, the scent seems to be controversial. I like scented products unless the scent absolutely knocks me over the head. I found this product to have a pleasant, light floral scent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVIM9WRDOH6OC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKJGSK8#wasThisHelpful","RVIM9WRDOH6OC","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Grace Keepers is ""soft"" science fiction, intent on examining a society and its characters. It reminds me of Ursula LeGuin's work. The setting is some world, whether Earth or other, where most of the land mass has been covered by rising sea levels.  Although the characters sense the gradual dwindling of the land and their already scarce resources, this is not a dystopia or a post-apocalyptic novel. People simply accept this as the way things are. There are two parts to society: the damplings, who live on ships and seafood, and the landlockers, who live on tiny plots of land, some of it ""reclaimed,"" where the houses are on stilts.The book brings the two worlds together by means of the Circus Excalibur, which travels around the islands and gives shows in return for food and money. North, one of the two main characters, is the circus's bear trainer and performer, where part of the wonder is the viewing of a bear (the inference is that most species, especially large ones, are endangered). The other main character, Callanish, is the ""grace keeper,"" or funeral director/priestess, for one of the islands. Other characters include Red Gold/Jarrow, the charismatic ringmaster/circus owner (and at around 40, old for this society); Avalon, his young, beautiful, self-centered, greedy, bitchy wife; Ainsel, his grown son from his first marriage; the acrobats/lovers Melia and Whitby; Flitch, a messenger who travels from island to island; and Odell, Callanish's alcoholic grace-keeper neighbor.One theme of the book is self-delusion. Red Gold is obsessed with the idea of his descendents returning to the land (which he left to marry his first wife). He believes this will give them not only higher social status, but wealth and happiness (even though the landlockers' lives are as hardscrabble as the damplings'). To this end, he wants to marry the bear girl North to Ainsel, a marriage neither desires, even though they've known each other since childhood. Much of the plot revolves around Red Gold's saving money for the very expensive land (while portions constantly disappear to police fines and bribes), and trying to pretend that North and Ainsel love each other and that North's pregnancy was caused by Ainsel. Red Gold firmly believes in the glamour of his circus, no matter how tattered it is. He also believes his wife is loving and kind.North believes in the love of her bear, even though it's a restive and dangerous animal. Callanish believes in the love of her mother and wants to return to her, even though her mother physically attacked her and made her a grace keeper (which is an exile and punishment). Fitch and Odell each believe that they can form a workable relationship with Callanish. As you'll guess, another theme of this book is loneliness.Aside from a number of circus members who are mostly background (because their functions are necessary to the circus), the characters are well-rounded and complex. Fitch, for example, could be seen simplistically as a condescending, exploitative, domineering male, but he does have some real feeling for Callanish and can behave well, as well as badly. Avalon is a type we all love to hate, but that's necessary to the plot. In part of the book, you can't tell whether Melia is sincere or whether she is acting, as she does so well.The marketing copy says that Grace Keepers is ""inspired in part by Scottish myths and fairy tales."" Actually, that is a very minor theme and you don't have to know any Scottish tales to understand the book. It does help to keep mermaids in mind:  Is humanity slowly adapting so that people can live both on land and in the sea?Five stars for this gentle, melancholy, yet ultimately hopeful book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P2QR864JV4F3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553446614#wasThisHelpful","R1P2QR864JV4F3","AM18CU72YEWH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM18CU72YEWH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are so bad for your teeth. There is so much sugar. I can feel the coating on my teeth after I eat these. But at the same time, they do taste nice. They are chewy and a bit citrusy.

I have done it so much and talked about meals so much that I have ended up influencing my friends to do the same. Food & Wine has great photos of unusual meals. I am not sure if I will make all of these or any of these. Usually, the meals are very fancy. I would think this magazine is geared more towards really experienced chefs and not novices, in terms of recipes and advice, but it's still pretty for those who are food voyeurs. I think it would be cool if they expanded this magazine's scope and reach to include articles on food related tangents like their upcoming festival schedules, restaurants, cook shows, features on specific chefs, cooking show reviews, etc.  But maybe that's not their intent.

"This is wonderful. I think Straczynski is a genius and he should write more screenplays, specifically for Superman. He manages to take a mythos that has been done a thousand times and change minor but important details to give the story a completely fresh take. His stories and characters manage to have more dimension than the original. I would argue that he really enhances the appeal of the whole Clark Kent/ Superman essence. Growing up, I watched everything Superman related: all the cartoons, all the movies (Christopher Reeves), Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, Smallville, etc. I found this product to be superior to many of those listed and stronger in many ways.  I really enjoyed this addition to the superman legacy. I really hope that Straczynski  continues to write them and the artists continue to draw this.  It's a really engaging storyline.

"These are really unhealthy probably. But they taste so darn good. I have gone through the box so quickly. I may end up ordering more. The strawberry and frosting are a bit sweet. But it is still awesome to have as a early morning breakfast or mid evening snack. Sometimes you just like to have something soft and warm and gooey to munch on. I find warming these in the toaster oven to much improve the flavor. I never eat these cold.  The smell of them cooking is also amazing.

"Well, the good news is I am now eating breakfast. The bad news is it is because I am trying to get rid of these as fast as I can. The bars are ok. They are probably really healthy for me, even. I can taste the fruit and fiber. The issue I have with these are there is a LOT of fiber. I mean, I can literally chew the oats. It's really really really fibrous. I find the texture to be a bit unappetizing due to the fact that I have to chew flavorless oats before I can get to the fruity center. I wouldn't mind if the oats tasted a bit more like something, but they don't. They taste like oats. Maybe health nuts will love this bar.  But I am a firm believer that food needs to taste good. Even if it is healthy, it is possible to make it taste good. There are ways to add flavor without dumping in high fructose corn syrup. I think the food industry needs to just get more creative about it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C52PHF4AWSRE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8QZ7OW#wasThisHelpful","R1C52PHF4AWSRE","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This watch is really expensive. I can't really afford it. But I got it anyways. Yay for my new years resolution to save more.  Anyways, I tried this out in the mall. It is really comfortable compared to ordinary leather straps. It is very light weight and perfect for extra small wrists and hands. I have very tiny wrists. Most watch cannot fit my hand because of it. If I ever got arrested by police, I am sure I could escape - that's how small my wrists are. Anyways, this watch is perfect for really tiny arms.It is made of really soft leather. It is not made of the fake/ cheap grade leather that rubs the skin the wrong way. It feels like it is made from the actual hide (1 piece) not a bunch of strips that have been plasticized together. The watch is also true to color. The black shown in the picture matches the black color in person. This is important to note because a lot of things don't look the same online through a computer screen verses in real life. I like that they didn't hire professional photographers to distort the image of the watch to make it look more marketable.The face of the screen has panels on it, which I presume are used to store the solar powered light. The watch was set once by me when it first arrived and has been fine ever since. It's accuracy rivals other watches. For those who are visually impaired, it may be difficult to see the demarcation on the watch face. They are thin silver strips that note the hours.  Fortunately, I am near sighted and not far sighted so it is not hard for me to read the watch. If you are far sighted, you probably will hate this watch.  But if you are near sighted and don't mind tilting the screen to reflect light, you can easily see the position of the watch hands.This watch matches all clothing. It is such a simple elegant watch. You can wear it to interviews or to the beach. It blends in with everything. That's what I like the most about it. It looks like it could either be really inexpensive or really expensive. That's how perfect the design is. It is the ultimate incognito watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29RHXM10OFY94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ZPMYNG#wasThisHelpful","R29RHXM10OFY94","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like these because they are inexpensive compared to the other sandals online. But I do think that for the material, it should not be $8.99. It could be cheaper. These are not super high quality. They are pretty standard bath slippers. The material reminds me of disposable plastic. I think they look as pictured, but the picture kind of makes it looks like it would be made out of softer material maybe.  The shoe will serve my purposes though as a travel shower shoe.

I find this product easy to use and easy to reproduce. The only thing that I don't like is the yellow color. That's just a peeve of mine. It looks artificial to me. I wish they would pick another color that looks more natural. For some reason, I just can't get over how artificially yellow this cake mix is. Even bananas are not this yellow.

"I'm loving this test prep book so far. I found this to be extremely useful. I haven't taken the new GRE yet. I plan to in a bit. The prep is good because there are a large variety of questions from the actual makers of the exam. I found that the format has changed a lot from the old exam. I took the old exam over 9 years ago. Now, I am trying to 'refresh' my memory on how math standardized exams work. This book is very helpful because it gives me actual questions that were used. It has the right 'difficulty' level for me to train on. The answers come in the back and have some explanation. You can use this as a study aid. I would definitely recommend this book if its the only test prep you plan on getting. I also bought the GRE full prep book from ETS so I can try that after I finish this.

"This variety pack is good for those who like Pop chips and want to try out all the flavors. I found some flavors to be superior to others, but this may be due to my personal preference. The BBQ flavor is their strongest in my opinion. I do like the fact that all their flavors taste different from one another. The popped chip is less oily and has a nice crunch. The chips themselves remind me of a cross between a cheese puff (minus the cheese) and a normal potato chip. I find them light and airy with an interesting texture. I would buy these again if they went on sale and/or had other flavors offered in a variety pack. This box may be too big for one person to eat alone. It may be more appropriate for large families.

"I ran out of shows to watch during the Summer. I had seen a lot of commercials for Rizzoli and Isles in the movie theatres, but never actually saw any of it before until recently. I saw that it was in its 6th season and kept hearing about it.  One day I went on YouTube and saw the first episode. Angie Harmon is a really great actress! I started watching the show because of her and then started to like it. It is not really that great, like Elementary is, but it is decent enough. I think the show started to improve from season 1 to season 2, so I have hopes that it will be stronger.  I like the cast being females that get along as opposed to the traditional male dominated ones. When shows always make the male the hero, it can be trite. I like that there is some uniqueness to the storyline. The acting is good, in all the characters are pretty likeable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6EILVF9HW57C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C8DGJC#wasThisHelpful","R6EILVF9HW57C","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I might buy some of their stock. The pads are soft and flexible. They absorb well. They are shorter than the overnight version. They feel like memory foam.

You can easily wear this and feel like you are not wearing a pad. It absorbs a lot of liquid and provides huge coverage. I always buy these when I can. In fact, I stock up on these because I heard rumors that they might discontinue it. Always Infinity is so great. They really need to advertise it better because most people don't know about them.

"This movie can be described as ""Campy Fun.""  It was pretty good for a free movie!  I would recommend this to those who are looking for something light hearted and Disney-esque.  The only thing that goes against it is the fact that there is somewhat adult humor scattered throughout. It may not be whole-ly appropriate for really young kids. Otherwise, this movie has decent acting. It also has superstars like Samuel L Jackson and big names like Jessica Alba in it.  The storyline is pretty basic. A new girl tries to fit in at a school, where she doesn't quite belong. She learns what is important and deals with relationships. The 'twist' is that she is a trained assassin. The movie is more like a comedy than is dark like Nikita.

"I believe Elon Musk will save mankind from extinction.  Mark my words.  This guy is a genius!!! But more importantly, he is using his huge brain to try and help solve world problems.  Not get rich quick problems, but WORLD SALVATION PROBLEMS.  Seriously, the sun is a dying star. Look it up.  We have maybe a few more thousand years on this planet. Our resources are dwindling.  Our food supply now depends on genetic modification. Traditional farming methods are not able to feed the masses. We polluting the oceans, killing the fish, toxifying the air, fumigating the sky and destroying our ozone. I can totally see how ONE extinction level event would be enough to wipe us off the face of the universe, if we don't do it ourselves with all the wars and socioeconomic battles we have going on right now.... Alas,  most people are concerned only about their daily problems (how to make money, live a comfortable life) and not their children's or children's children's (how to protect the planet, plan for the future).  We consume so much and not all of these are renewable resources.  Fossil fuels are depleting! WE are FRACKING.  Time to do something about it... Someone anyone.  Come up with a solution!!!!  ""Colonize mars"" says Mr. Musk.  Prior to reading this book, I would have thought this was lunatic talk. After reading this book, I totally believe Elon believes what he believes and it all makes sense.Just an amazing story.  I love the way this is written. I am only part way through it. I will update this review if anything changes, but so far this is really well written. I have had a hard time putting it down. It's just incredible what Elon Musk has gone through and how well Ashlee Vance tells his story. It reads like a movie. It is so easy to visualize. You can totally see, feel inspired, and want to do great things from learning about Elon's terrible childhood and obstacles he faced to what he has become today. It's awesome! I love tales like this because it is so incredibly motivational.You feel a lot from a biography. That's how you know the writer is talented.Today, I want to meet Elon! But since I am not rich nor famous (yet), I will have to suffice with this book.  To give some tidbits for people who are considering buying this, this book is for you if you like reading biographies and are curious about how great ideas are executed upon.  I love the fact that Mr. Musk was willing to share his story with the world. In my opinion, Ashlee Vance did a good job of describing a balanced point of view. He showed all arguments made for and against Elon.  He documents how some think he his insane, but all recognize his accomplishments are remarkable.  Not only has Musk revolutionalized engineering, he has done it in THREE SEPARATE FIELDS.  He created entire industries from scratch: solar power (Solar city), space exploration (Space X ), and automobile (Tesla).  Bonus: not included is Paypal.The only downside of reading this book is you may feel like a loser after reading this. I feel the sudden urge to do more with my life.  Well done!  Awesome reading.

In a few minutes, you can peel off your gross debris. It works wonders, especially if you want to keep your face hygienic and beautiful close up.

"I got this for my sister. She was obsessed with Shark Tank.  This product did not disappoint. It appears to be heavy duty relative to the other Scrub Daddys. It is a big thicker looking. It also comes lemon scented. She has used this a couple of times to wash the dishes. Even though she used dishwashing detergent, which is supposedly not needed, this product still smells like Lemon. She has used this a couple of times already now.  It still looks brand new. The product retained its shape and works as expected. You pay a little extra for the thicker scrub and the lemon scent, but I think it is worth it if you factor in the cute factor and how sturdy it appears to be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S9YA15HCQXD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGWJCIA#wasThisHelpful","R3S9YA15HCQXD8","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this but it broke easily after my first felting experience. I like how you can arrange how many needles you will use.  You just have to be careful when felting at angles. I ended up snapping off the end of 1 of 3 of my needles. It got stuck in some wool. I couldn't get it out easily. Instead, it just snapped in half.  Besides that, the overall ergonomics of this pen is really nice. It is easy to hold in your hand. It also comes with its own little plastic stand. You can use that to hold your pen.  I really like clover products. So, I am giving this a 4/5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GHUVE0PXZA4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00172TD5S#wasThisHelpful","R3GHUVE0PXZA4X","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This actually works really well for felting. I wasn't sure how good it would be.  It's really light weight and looks just like a giant foam sponge. It basically is a giant foam sponge.

"I am addicted. This is the best of the 3 books.  It makes everything that happened in book 1 & 2 make so much more sense. I would recommend you read the other two before this one, so you get the full impact of how genius Soman is. The story is really well written and action happens quickly. The characters are all ones you can root for or care for. I would argue even the ""evil"" ones are sympathetic. I actually got the kindle version on pre-order because I was so addicted to the first two.  The formatting was really good.  The moral of the story is also good.  You should check on Good Reads for its rating, where people rank books. This book has one of the highest ratings on that site. I would definitely recommend this to others.

So, you may need to experiment on yourself to see which drug and which dosage works best for you. However, I have found Advil to be a reliable brand. I have bought other brands before, but they do not have as good packaging or have been involved in recall scandals. Advil however to my knowledge has not endured any of these. It is a good product.

"The price on Amazon is a little more expensive than what you would get in a regular drug store. But, you have the convenience of home delivery. These Vitamin C drops are the best. They taste like real fruit and not too artificial. The citrus variety includes lemon, orange and grapefruit. Each of these are not too sweet. They are great lozenges. I sometimes eat them like they are candy.  Don't worry. Vitamin C is water soluble. Even if you imbibe a lot, it will wash out.Halls makes great cough drops because they taste natural and they are not hollow in the center. The shape is perfectly oval.

"So, this movie was a lot better than I thought it would be.  It was FREE on Amazon Prime to boot. Most free movies are of mixed quality, especially the newer ones. But this one was pretty decent considering my lowered expectations.  The movie was probably better than Sam Worthington's version of Perseus.In this version of Hercules, there is very little shown about the myth. The version presented here shows Hercules as a man of mythic proportions. The concept tries to make it more realistic. The visuals, costume, make up and music are all very high quality. The action sequences are beautiful and epic. The use of slow motion is done well here.However, the parts that are lacking are that the script and dialogue lack humor and depth. It is pretty standard fare. If you enjoy a B grade popcorn flick, you may like this film.  It has some of the scenery of the Gladiator but the villains are not as scary.  A lot of standard, predictable movie tropes end up being played out.It's a little predictable but half way decent because of the graphics.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM35YDYQ2KUMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPX5M9M#wasThisHelpful","RM35YDYQ2KUMI","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this little grill. We have used it twice already. It is high quality for a low price. The Weber portable grill was convenient for myself and my family to use. We got a good sear with charcoal. The grates were easy to use. There is a slot at the bottom and one at the top. If you want to start a charcoal fire, you just have to remember to have both slots open. This allows the oxygen to get through!  You need carbon, oxygen and an ignition source to get the fire roasting!  If you close the grate, nothing will happen.  Put some newspapers on the bottom but leave a small hole for the air flow to move through. Pile on your unused charcoal. Light the newspaper and wait for the charcoal to catch.  When the charcoal turns red, orange or grey then you are good to go.  Let it heat the grill for about 30 minutes or so. That way you get an even distribution of heat. Then, you can put on your marinated meat or hotdogs. We used aluminum foil to cover our grill so the hotdogs wouldn't fall in. The dogs still got the grill marks on them and tasted great. I would recommend this cute little guy to anyone looking for a first time Weber grill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PBH3OEVD2H05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004RALL#wasThisHelpful","R2PBH3OEVD2H05","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! This was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. I went into this with mediocre expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  I found this film to be entertaining and leave you with a positive feeling. The IMDB rating for it is only 6.6/10, which usually means the movie is bad. But this movie turned out to be pretty decent. It's not the Godfather but it is something fun and light to watch.  There is enough of storyline and witty lines to keep things interesting.  The acting is solid.The plot /concept is pretty basic - similar to ""Clueless"", ""Mean Girls"", and ""The Heathers"" - but in a modern high school and more realistic. Bianca is a regular girl who fits in by virtue of being associated with her beautiful friends.  This doesn't bother her until one day, her old childhood friend Wesley, informs her she is a DUFF. After a chain of events, Bianca sets out on a personal quest to rid herself of this label and become her own person. In the process, she experiments and grows.  There is a bit of a romance story going on. I won't give away spoilers, but the interactions between the characters is funny and charming at times.I would recommend this to people who like shows like ""Selfie""  or movies about coming of age.  Everything that happened in this movie is pretty common to high school interactions.  This movie is kind of like a Disney film but more grown up.  I would say it is worth renting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12NEO76GCLO19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXS8PQ0#wasThisHelpful","R12NEO76GCLO19","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a size up. Although I am a extra small in most American manufacturer size rating systems, I bought the small because I wanted to have some space for layering. The fit was as expected for me. I am 5' 2"" approximately and 110 lbs approximately. The fleece was soft and comfortable, even in chilly weather. I found it to be pleasant to wear during the morning as well as the evening. Because of the neutral grey color, I am able to wear this with a lot of my regular clothing. The only thing I do not like is the fact that the pockets have zippers. It's useful because it lets you hold in small items in your pockets, but it is rough on the edges. If you like putting your hands in your pocket, this may not be ideal for you.

"These tabs are quickly becoming my favorite. I love the fact that the price point as an add on is very reasonable (less than $4 at the time of my purchase) and the pack includes a variety of flag colors. There is a decent quantity compared to other packs by the same company. The 3M brand seems to be more durable than some of its knock off competitors. I find the adhesive to be of appropriate stickiness, so that it does not seem to cling too much to my book or note pages. When I buy the cheap flags, they tend to rip the ink off or tear the pages of my notes. Therefore, I am sticking with 3M from now on. The size for these tabs is on the smaller size but since I am just using these as literal flags and not using them to label I am fine with the size.

"I just got the chance to use this Kleenex. It helped to have this pack around. The colors of the box are classy enough looking that they blend in with more elegant dcor. Also, the soap itself is very thick and soft. It does not tear easily, unlike some generic brands. The ply count is higher than normal.

"I finally got the chance to use this paper soap when I went BBQ-ing at a park on Memorial Day. This soap is unlike others that I bought in that the sheets are thicker and the soap is actually sliced into the sheet. It is not paper that has soap woven into its threading. As a result, the sheet itself is thicker than some other paper soaps. The soap slice takes a longer time to dissolve, but at least you know when it does, it is all soap. The variety pack comes in neon colors but the scents are not too obnoxious. They are innocuous to smell. I found this carrying pack very useful. Each different scented soap was individually wrapped in a plastic pouch, which made it easy to divvy up and carry. I split this soap pack with some family members. For those new to paper soap, the price point at $12 for pack of 6 is a pretty good deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3169Z9QBL17JT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YQ1V5A#wasThisHelpful","R3169Z9QBL17JT","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this humidifier. Ever since I started using it, I have slept so much better. I wake up much less in the middle of the night. My throat is not scratchy or itchy anymore. I previously was having terrible humidity in my bedroom. I didn't realize this could make me have such bad sore throats because I never use to have these problems. I just thought old age was getting to me. Then, I heard from a doctor that if you don't have proper humidity you can have all sorts of nasal passage discomfort. I checked the humidity in my bedroom and it was a whopping 30% (super low). I decided to give this humidifier a try because it had a good price point. I just wanted to test and see if humidity might help my condition. AND, the end result is the $30 I spent for this unit was so worth it.  Prior to purchasing this unit, I went on Amazon and did an extensive review of all the humidifiers that are being sold. Of the ones currently for sale (through March 2015), this was the cheapest one with the highest rating. All the other cheap ones were only 4 stars. All the other 4.5 star ones were really expensive, like double the price at least. I just wanted a starter unit that looked good and was easy to operate.  I am VERY pleased and will be recommending this to all my friends and family.PROS:*inexpensive*easy to use: start, fill and clean*attractive*made by a reputable sellerCONS:* none that I can think ofThe unit does glow a little and make a bit of a faint 'white noise' but I don't think that this would be a significant problem for most people unless you are ultra sensitive to light and sound or something. I found this to be nice and almost soothing background noise. I like very much how you can see the mist come out if you put it on high setting. As other reviewers stated, this unit does not hold much water, but I don't find that to be a problem because I empty and refill it every day (for hygiene reasons) and that is super easy to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UB1U58WEC862/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOI5QUU#wasThisHelpful","R2UB1U58WEC862","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You need a minimum of 8 people to play this game. Not by the instructions but if you want it to be fun. It is only interesting if you are playing against people you don't know that well. If you play with family members, you will probably be able to guess the answers. I got this game based off a recommendation from a coworker. When I tried to play it with 3 other family members, the game was not fun at all. It was too easy to guess. It was not for lack of trying to make it fun. The answer choices were very obvious even if we tried to disguise our personalities. You really need a large group or people you don't know that well to have fun. For that reason and also the high cost of this game, I am giving it only three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AY44ZJUB9XNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMUEYOE#wasThisHelpful","R3AY44ZJUB9XNS","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my first short story.  I really liked the intro. It sucked me in from the beginning and the story itself was interesting and engaging. Except, it didn't really end what a satisfying conclusion. I think the story could have ended in a more impactful way. Instead, this story kind of made me feel really depressed about what happened. I left feeling hollow.  I think the descriptions of each of the characters and the writing style was well done and not clich. But it lacked the oomph a lot of really impactful short stories have.  For instance, in the Lady or the Tiger - one of my favorite short stories, I am left wondering long after what happened to the characters.

"Ridiculously addictive and can be played in many different ways. You can play it the standard banana grams way or you can try variations where you can 'steal words from other people'. Really, the game is a bag of word blocks. What you choose to do with them is really up to you. The price for the banana is good because it has a lot of letters in it. I think it holds more than the apple and the pear version do. You will have fun with this game if you like games that are similar to Scrabble. It involves speed and some vocab.  You can getaway though with knowing less words than in Scrabble.

"I absolutely love this card game. It's so funny.  You have to play it with a group of people. The more creative the people are the more fun. It is a game where you basically bluff and try to bluff the best. This would appeal to those who like to play 'nerdy trivia type games' with a twist. Basically, the premise is as follows: you are dealt a card. On the card will be a choice of categories. You may be given a word or acronym or a movie or a law. On the back is the correct definition, meaning, plot, or tenet.  You make up fake answer choices and ask your opponent to guess which one is the correct definition from the list of fakes you've given. If you can fool them, then you get extra points. If they can still guess the correct answer, then they get the point. It is a race to the finish. Never has lying been so rewarding. The cards from this box set are numerous and have a wide variety of trivia. Even if you play against a genius, they are unlikely to know all the correct answers. Therefore, they must rely on their deductive reasoning.PROS:* good clean fun* clever and more fun with clever groups of people* lots of repeatability due to high number of cards and categoriesCONS* need at least 2 to 4 players","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MJGF0H7NF613/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFUKSIS#wasThisHelpful","R2MJGF0H7NF613","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I finally got to this book and finished it. It's very short and reads quickly. The only thing I didn't like is that it is not as interesting as Cinder, Scarlet or Cress. The beginning starts off promisingly enough. However, I found Levana to be unsympathetic. I would rather she be completely cruel and cold and calculating from birth rather than a lonely person who was abused and warped in her own self-destruction. There were many shocking plot twists though, which I did not necessarily see coming. However, because Levana was so unlikeable I found this difficult to read. I found that I could not have much empathy for her because of her poor decision making. To me, she seemed to be the architect of her own misery. AND - in real life, I hate people like that.Queen Levana as you know her in the other books is much more interesting. She is cruel and barbaric. She is calculating and shrewd. I see that many people like this book because it fleshes out her backstory and gives rationale to her behavior. But I think it would have been more interesting if Levana had some redeeming qualities -- ruthlessness or cunning. To me though, her ruthlessness was stupid. In that she would do things that didn't really help her achieve any of the goals that she desired. I would have liked to see her either have more dimension or be depicted as unstoppable and someone to fear.Instead, I felt like she was just a tragic monstrosity. She seemed to have been victim to bullying and abuse by a cruel sister. Possibly, she suffered some kind of mental damage as a child. And, she always felt sorry for herself. I mean--- the same exact thing kind of happened to Cinder but Cinder decided to be a good person instead.So, for me I would rank the book in the series in the following order:CressCinderScarletFairestAlthough Winter has not come out yet, the first 4 chapters are included in this copy of Fairest. I would say that Winter and Jacin have a very promising storyline. I look forward to that still although I was unfortunately greatly underwhelmed by Fairest.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A2GEBVIB7CBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0IACSG#wasThisHelpful","R1A2GEBVIB7CBR","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this as a gift for my sister. She loved it. It is a DIY canvas that comes folded with a set of paints. The painting is a bit more complex than standard DIY paintings but the final product has a lot of gradations in color. It is one of the more unique ones that are on sale on Amazon. This fabric does not come with a frame. You would have to buy one yourself.

"I wish I could get a refund for this.  Seriously, I thought it was that bad. I don't think I can finish it. I really wanted to like this book because a couple of my friends recommended it to me. But seriously... it's bad. Like really bad. And I like most books.  :(  If you are on the fence, I highly recommend you take advantage of Amazon's peek inside the book program or borrow it first if you are Prime member. Do not leap in and buy this. Because you will either love it or possibly totally hate it and be upset.What annoys me about this book is that it tries to present itself as something it is not. Although the introduction goes to great lengths saying that this book is just simply trying to show the economics of things around the world, everything drips with inflated marketing.  A lot of the stories and examples start off with promise but go now where. They just end up with really shallow observations.Example:1. Prostitution will not go away because there will always be a market for it. - There, now you don't have to read that chapter.2. Suicide bombers do not buy life insurance because they expect to die.  - There, now you don't have to read that chapter.The WHOLE book is like this. It's annoying.  I feel really jibbed out of $8.  Also, I found some of their conclusions (ex why drunk walking is more dangerous than drink driving) to be based on flawed logic and mathematical error.  So, that pissed me off from the start. Also, I found the writing style to just jump around randomly like stream of consciousness. It was tough for me to follow.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ADVJ3YZUWQ2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002R2OFGY#wasThisHelpful","R1ADVJ3YZUWQ2O","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this movie. I think its hilarious. It's a parody of all the slasher movies ever made. The best part about it is it doesn't try to be cheesy. All the acting is done supremely seriously, which makes it so fantastic. Every single trope that is seen in a horror flick makes a cameo. There are the partying teenagers, the hot chick who wanders off in the woods, the usual suspects. But all of the characters have a unique twist to them, especially Tucker and Dale.

"The price here on Amazon is good for this product. These noodles are really famous in Korea. You can get them in specialty stores here in the US. I have even seen them make their way into some American chain stores with large international sections. The spice factor is pretty intense but you can adjust how much spice their is by moderating how much of the packet you put in to the bowl. These noodles are extremely flavorful. They have a spicy, rich savory flavor with just the right amount of balancing sweetness. It is a great ramen product.

The bags do feel somewhat delicate. As other reviewers mentioned, they may break. I am not surprised by this because they were not very expensive and the mesh material is very fine.

My entire foyer actually smells like peppermint from just one spray of my shoes. I personally do not have a problem with normal peppermint smell but this is really strong, even for me.  Another female reviewer had made the same comment earlier. I had disregarded it because I thought that maybe she  just had a sensitive nose. I can say that while I do have a slightly more sensitive nose than other people, if you do not like the smell of peppermint, you probably would not be able to tolerate this.

"Ok, I was not sure what to expect. It has been day 1. But my FEET don't smell anymore. This is great. I was kind of skeptical when I opened this product and tried it. The instructions were really simple. The package comes with just one pair of socks and a single dose application. Basically, you rub this white talc lotion on your feet, throughout the soles, after you have taken a bath and dried your feet. You have to make sure you get the entire foot covered. Then, you put on the pair of breathable socks and take a nap. You sleep with the socks and the lotion on for a night. Afterwards, you wake up and wash the substance off. Your feet won't smell anymore.  I am planning on looking up each of the ingredients later. I can update this review if anything changes, but right now I am very happy. I feel like I should post a review since not that many people posted a review so far on this product. It totally works +1 day.  It is easy to use and its not too expensive.

"I am shocked!  My feet have never been so soft, even when I was a baby. I use to have really gnarly looking heels. Not sure when my feet turned green and yellow and crackly. I am pretty young still. I am in my early thirties, but if you had seen my feet a month ago in a lineup you would have thought that was really disgusting. You may have wondered what kind of lifestyle I led, which made my feet so calloused.  Also, at some point, over the years, my feet started to smell. -- And I mean SMELL BAD.I started panicking. I didn't want the trend of bad feet to only get worse. I mean, I was only thirty for crying out loud. If this was the state of my feet then, what would it be like in a decade?  Thus, I did a frantic internet search for foot deodorizing products and feet related products. My goal was to just buy as much of 5 star reviewed foot related items as I could, and try them all. I didn't care which worked. I just needed something to. But, in the end, after reading so many mixed reviews about so many products, I ended up only picking this one and one other.The other one is a shoe deodorizer.  It is meant to remove the stink. This one though, actually promised to get rid of cracks. I am not sure if the cracks were the homes of where the bacteria that lived in my feet lived but I do know that this product removed the cracks and now my feet are soft and do not smell anymore. I will DEFINITELY reorder this when I run out.  This product may have somewhat ugly packaging (bright blue with orange font that says FEET on it) but it works like magic.To use it, I just followed the instructions that are on the jar. Every night for a week, I would rub some on the cracks. Within the first 3 days, I started noticing improvement. Within a week of application (every night), my feet look like Cinderella's. I am so happy. There is a reason this product has like 1000 five star reviews.

"I bought this for studying, even though I am an adult. I didn't want to waste paper. I kept hovering between getting the more modern version (2.0 with removable battery) and this older model. The 2.0 version has options for you to replace the battery when it wears out. It is only one dollar more expensive. The reason I did not get this and instead opted for this older model is because the comments on the newer version stated that the stylus was less easy to handle (more fat).I am using this to study for a biochemistry graduate school exam. I have been using this to draw structures and reaction mechanisms. It is great in that I feel like I am saving a lot of paper and I don't have to run around my house with mounds of paper. I like how I can conveniently carry it from location to location without adding on too much bulk to my already enormous study materials.The writing is very easy. It feels like a normal pen. You just press fairly lightly onto the boogie board and the board will get marked up. The width of the writing is similar to that of using a felt tip marker. The only disadvantage of the boogie board is that you cannot erase part of the writing you make, to erase, you need to clear the whole board. That's fine though if you are okay with crossing out your mistakes. I do not think this is a total replacement for paper but this is a good tool to use if you want to practice on a board without generating too much paper waste.It is not a substitute for a paper notepad, but I think it can be used as a great supplement to aid your studying- even if you are an adult.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RR0MN66MI4FB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFPR684#wasThisHelpful","R1RR0MN66MI4FB","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I carefully read all of the reviews on here, because that is how choosy I am when it comes to online clothes purchases. Following the instructions of other reviewers, I ordered a size up and it fits as expected this way.  Normally, I wear size smalls.  Therefore, I ordered size medium and it fit snuggly.These go great under your normal work clothes. I find that the thermal underwear helps transform my wardrobe to be multi-seasonal. Pants that I usually wear in fall and spring now can also be worn in winter. The thermal layer goes underneath and the pants just pull on top. Because the thermal underwear is shorter and more clingy than normal pants, you can hardly tell if you have both on.  My legs stopped being cold in the snow.Previously, I was trying to find thick pants. But I found a better solution. I can wear fashionable normal pants and just slide these on underneath. I chose to get the grey colored ones originally (which look nicer than the coloring on here in the photo, in my opinion- the photo makes them look greenish) and now I am back to purchase the white ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GVKGOSHYG21W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVLRPAU#wasThisHelpful","R1GVKGOSHYG21W","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't actually think it was possible but I got this ping pong racket anyways. I read a lot of reviews about how this paddle would make you a better ping pong player. To me, it seemed like hype or maybe even some kind of weird placebo effect where people who buy really expensive goods think they must have inherent virtue by being expensive (Velben good).  But, I tried it... maybe I am brainwashed. I don't know but I would swear that this thing has made me much better at Ping Pong. Not only is the pressure in my hand relieved. I feel like I have a lot better control of my swing. When I try to aim a ball in a certain direction, it is much easier for my hand and physics to get along. I have noticed a vast improvement in my game. There are people I play against who are way better than me, but this paddle makes me more confident and more in control. I would recommend this to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F80I9V9XJZTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TX6S98#wasThisHelpful","R2F80I9V9XJZTP","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This treadmill is heavy. Like, super heavy. Unless you have the strength of 3 men, I highly recommend you get a partner to help you set this up. The package arrived very quickly from Amazon with Prime Shipping. The box, as other reviewers stated, comes punctured. The side will have a hole in it. I suspect this is from the forklift that they use to move this package in the warehouse, where it is distributed. It is too coincidental for all the packages to have a giant hole in them. Although there was a hole in this product box, the inside of mine was perfectly in tact. The treadmill took some work to assemble. I estimate it to be approx. 1-2 hours to put together. It will take longer if you argue. The actual assembly is not too difficult because it is pretty intuitive. The final product looks just like what is pictured on the product image. The fully setup up treadmill is pretty narrow, relative to other treadmills. Therefore, if you have wide feet or an especially wide girth, you may want to take that into consideration. Otherwise, for narrower people, this is not too bad. It may take some adjustment because it is slightly different from the more expensive high end treadmills. The treadmill itself is automatic. It has a plug that takes standard outlet electricity.  You can vary the speeds somewhat. It has all the basic functions of a treadmill without any frills. There is no radio. There is no TV.  It is just a treadmill with a small holder for you to put a book or kindle or IPAD.  For a starter piece of exercise equipment, this is a solid product at a reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMWKX2VZGQLHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007O5B0LC#wasThisHelpful","RMWKX2VZGQLHD","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to protect my lemon tree before I went to Japan for 2 weeks. This product actually worked pretty well. I had to use 2 of these to keep my lemon tree alive but when I returned the leaves were still blooming. I liked that this product worked as described. It was extremely easy to setup. The only thing I didn't like was that it can be messy. You have to put this in the potted plant then manage to get an upside down water bottle in it without spilling the water everywhere. I lost a lot of water trying to get bottles into the stake. Also, as a tip, I recommend you only put this in large plants. I tried this with smaller plants and it knocked over the entire plant. I basically killed one of my smaller bamboo plants because the water made the whole pot tip over. I would like if these came in a variety of sizes and had an easier way of attaching a bottle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U8XWT333R99H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQTOBHM#wasThisHelpful","R2U8XWT333R99H","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Got this as a Christmas present for a friend. She loves it. It is beautiful and works as expected. I would recommend purchasing Cuisinart type products from Amazon since these types of kitchen appliance equipment usually cost more in retail box stores. For some reason, Amazon is able to offer better prices for this particular brand. I like the chrome finish. I would have selected other colors, but some colors cost more than the chrome. Chrome tends to match with everything, so I went with this instead.

"This product is EXTREMELY small. It should be called MINI pocket guide.  It is about the size of an index card. I think the product dimensions could be more prominently labelled. That said, the reason I am giving this 3 stars instead of 4 is that I think this is more of a 3.5 ish score. I can't really decide. I decided to round down for now. The pocket guide does contain useful phrases. I wouldn't necessarily call this instant Japanese as much as a very condensed listing of common travel phrases. This can be handy but in the age of smartphones, you may be better off with a smart phone ap that can do the same thing faster, as you can look up the phrases faster. Or, you could even get away with just printing out on a sheet of paper some phrases you think you may use.

"I decided not to write a review until after my international trip (including multiple airplane flights, train rides, trolley excursions and bus trips). I wanted to make sure that this would hold up. It looked sturdy enough and the reviews on this website were good, but I wanted to be sure. I have bought stuff before on Amazon where there have been glowing reviews but since there were so few of them, it was hard to tell if it was a real review or not.The Samsonite S Cure is amazing!  It is pretty expensive compared to regular luggage but you are paying for a polycarbonate shell with no zipper. There are no external fabric parts! This is great because then you don't have to worry about microbes or moisture latching on to the surface of your luggage. If you are a germ phobe, this is a god-send. After my 2 week long international travel, where I dragged this suitcase through multiple cities *including some with stinky sewage in the streets*, this suitcase survived with only a few scuff marks, easily wash away able.  I just used disinfecting cleansing wipes to wipe the surfaces and wheels.The Samsonite S Cure Spinner 28 is large size. It is one-size, which meant nothing to me. But basically, if you want an idea of what it is like I highly recommend you get a measuring tape out and check the dimensions. It is huge. It was able to carry for me 2 weeks worth of clothing and all the gifts I wanted to bring back. I stuffed this suitcase to the brim and it still had no problems staying shut. The suitcase has great hinges. It also has 3 manual locks on it. You can be sure that if you can fit your stuff in this suitcase and the suitcase will close, your belongings are secure. The closures are very intuitive despite being unlike any other suitcase I have ever seen.Picking this suitcase out from baggage claim was super easy. This stood out right away. Also, I loved that it came with a sticker that said made in Europe. I like it when companies don't simply outsource to China because it is cheaper. Even though I am of Chinese ethnicity, I find a lot of Chinese products cost-cut in dangerous ways, especially for those that involve plastics manufacture.This product is worth the $230 after tax I paid for it.  Right now, the black one is on sale for $180!!! Ah, I wish I had gotten it for $180. But none the less, I will keep my 5 star review because I love how this product survived my horrid travel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROKIEILFSANYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOXA8B6#wasThisHelpful","ROKIEILFSANYY","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this for a recent tip overseas to Japan. Based on the reviews, I took a risk. Very few products, especially of this type, have perfect 5 star average ratings. I am glad I followed the reviews. The Victorinox travel organizer was exactly as described.  The picture and color are accurate. I chose the black one because it would ship fastest via Amazon Prime. The travel organizer is very sturdy and has a quality feel to it  I loved how there were numerous pockets. I could organize my coins in the inner zippered mesh pocket.  I could separate my currencies in two letter sized internal pockets. There was space for my credit cards and health insurance info. There is an external pocket even for putting passports and boarding passes for easy retrieval. I will look to this brand for other related products in the future. In the past, I have bought many of these types of products but this one is the best. After an approximately 2 week long trip, I am in love with this organizer and its utility.  The only thing I wish for were more variety to choose from. Maybe this organizer with a handheld strap on it so I could carry it like a purse.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q03WQ0QP7DD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039MWQ80#wasThisHelpful","R1Q03WQ0QP7DD4","A2BBZGVLEGIAVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BBZGVLEGIAVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first time I installed a CF card I was concerned that the fit was too tight.  After a few uses the cards slid in without too much effort yet I had to be very careful to evenly push the card evenly into the reader.

I lent it to a friend and he returned it saying it didn't work.  I looked at the pins and they were bent.USB 3 compared to USB 2 transfer speed is jaw dropping.

"I've been involved with motion picture camera work for over 25 years.  I have never seen a camera on a set used without an eyepiece chamois.

"I think most people will be taken somewhat aback by Sentey's out of the box quality. With exceptional build quality usually left toward the 150$ plus headphone makers, these Thorx headphones are punching above their weight class.Goods: Build1) Overall appearance is quite good. With the brushed appearance on the headband and the attention to detail around the branding - even down to the colors chosen - the Thorx line is comparable to many in the higher market.2) The ear foam ear pads are both comfortable and great for sound isolation.3) Both functional and fashionable. The headband is the larger loop design but doesn't have that weird look like you're wearing a helmet.4) Recessed cable input. The recessed design makes for a more durable connection. If you want you can lay down with these on and not worry about the weight of your head bending the line input.5) Portable. With the ability to fold these in on themselves and the included hard clam shell storage case, these Thorx headphones are great for airplanes or long road trips.6) Earphone cable has included microphone for smartphone users.7) Comfortable clamping. The headphones are very comfortable when worn over longer periods. The clamping of the head loop is soft enough to not put too much pressure on your head or ears.Goods: Sound1) The bass is punchy, but not overpowered.2) The highs are steady, crisp and clean.3) Sound isolation is well done, but could be better with a softer ear foam.4) Clarity is great with a good offset with the lows.5) Volume max is good too, with clarity even in the higher range.Room for improvement:1) The ear foam could have been the softer style like the Brainwavz HM9 Hi-Fi Noise Isolating Headphones2) Break-in done at the factory. Out of the box the sound quality is good, but after a 24 hour break-in the sound improves a lot. I ran them at 75% for 24 hours on classical music.3) Although the build materials are good, they could be a little heavier. I'm not sure how long the lighter headband will last after being thrown around or how well they will hold up if you fall asleep wearing them. Something that will need to be tested over longer periods.Overall a great set of headphones that anyone would be happy with, especially for the price.*I received these in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PGAWJAISD83R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMX5AY#wasThisHelpful","R3PGAWJAISD83R","A19GTQ0YMXO8VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GTQ0YMXO8VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When asked to investigate the destruction of an artisan's fine wine collection, Agent Pendergast initially wants nothing to do with such a trivial crime, yet when he hears of some of the finer items in the collection that are still intact he negotiates a deal to help solve the crime in exchange for a bottle of wine. Together with Constance Greene, Pendergast sets out to solve the mystery and ends up taking on an even bigger quest when a century old skeleton is found within a bricked up wall.The first half of the book reads like most other Pendergast stories. The eclectic investigator sets out to solve a mystery with his usual flare of smacking down the local law enforcement types and educating the local hicks on the finer things in life. Many pages are dedicated to heightening the local cook's abilities, the local sheriff's professional etiquette, and general civility of the local folk. But surprisingly the biggest chunk of the book's first three quarters is a more passing of the torch to Constance Greene.Having taken a bigger role in the last book, Constance is back to aid Pendergast in his investigation. Along the way, Constance partakes in her own investigations and is tested on her findings and abilities later by Pendergast. For me anyways, the attention given to Constance reads like she is going to be a bigger figure in the future of Pendergast stories, a passing of the torch as said above.Having Constance play a bigger part leaves a little less room for the man we open the book for. Perhaps some readers will find this better as it brings a little more fresh air to a character that has become a little stale over the dozen plus books, but for me it really takes away from the man that makes me read these books. Perhaps like you, you believe the mysticism that the authors include in their stories is better geared to the challenge that faces the FBI agent. Yet in this tale, the magic and paranormal is reaching an all time high within our new duo.But even though the book drags on a little in the middle, most will find that the ending is quite enjoyable. Other installments have painted great endings and great cliffhangers as well, but this book's finale is quite surprising to say the least.Over all the book departs from the mainstay of the Pendergast franchise and reads like the author's are searching for something different to explore, but along the way there are some great scenes and fun voyages. For me anyways, I've enjoyed prior installments more. Good but not great.Three stars out of five.*I received this book in exchange for an honest opinion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3741GX7B0V1MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIDJ02A#wasThisHelpful","R3741GX7B0V1MH","A19GTQ0YMXO8VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GTQ0YMXO8VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
">Minor plot spoiler ahead<Summary:As a young boy, York Ballin knew the sting of rejection as his foster parents paid him little heed, and as he grew older the choices he made garnered him no more respect from society. So after a barbaric act committed by him and a few friends as young men, Ballin finds himself with a choice between a guaranteed short life on a distant mining facility or the possibility of an even shorter life aboard a starship in the Imperial Navy. In the end the choice is made for him, and he finds himself a lifer in the navy.Now a grown man and a lieutenant on the front lines, Ballin is unceremoniously appointed leader of a group of marine grunts setting out to rescue Princess Aeya from a local uprising on some distant rock of a planet. Not too happy being appointed the leader of the marines, and the marines not too happy with his appointment, Ballin finds a way to prove himself in the eyes of the grunts with his acts of loyalty to the troops. As a lifer, Ballin has little way of climbing the ranks in the Imperial Navy, yet his actions in the Princess's rescue sees him appointed the leader of all marines in the fleet.Now appointed to a new ship, the Cinesstar, Ballin finds himself the protector of not only the Princess but the Empress as well. After struggling to keep his crew alive under the horrible leadership of the ship's not so noble CO, Ballin finds a way to fight against enemy forces both within and beyond Imperial borders. As time goes on, it seems just about everyone is out to see the destruction of the Cinesstar. Forces meet in secret to hatch plans to see that death is brought to the ship, yet as time goes on it becomes more and more clear that the target of these assassin plans is not the royalty aboard, but Ballin himself. In the end we watch as one man, ripped apart and put back together again, finds a way to not only bring peace to his one ship, but to his people as well.Characters:Although there are plenty of great characters within the pages of Treasons, it is Ballin that is by far the most outstanding. Painted as a loyal soldier for the fleet, Ballin also proves himself an honor-bound man willing to sacrifice all for his crew and his ship. Ripped apart by war over and over again, Ballin reads more as a sacrificial combatant than a martyr for the cause, but as the page numbers go on, the reader will see that his character is not without flaw. In the end, our hero is just a broken man wiling to make the ultimate sacrifice for loyalty and peace.Writing:As a reader, we all want every book we read to be a real page turner, to be forced to stay awake long after our bedtimes. Here, in Choice of Treasons, we actually get a book difficult to put down; a rarity with books with such high page numbers. The characters in this book are very well refined and are written with incredible depth and meaning. Thankfully there is little in the way of filler, surprising given the 600+ page count, and every page is integral to the events on the next. And even though this is a space opera slash scifi book, the science fiction is left light so that the story can make for a more impactful presentation without being dragged down by irrelevant techno-babble.Conclusion:Although I initially delayed downloading this book because it is outside my usual Star Wars  Star Trek addiction, I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to the second installment out early 2016. The characters were brilliantly portrayed and the story was well crafted and presented. In the end the book achieved everything I look for in a great SciFi book and had all the elements that make me okay with the cover price. As someone who calls himself a huge fan of space operas, I recommend this to anyone looking for a good cat and mouse space drama.5 out of 5 stars from me.* I received this in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NK9QOF9AOAVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01543FECG#wasThisHelpful","R1NK9QOF9AOAVC","A19GTQ0YMXO8VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GTQ0YMXO8VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Volume 12 is an extravaganza of G.I. JOE goodness. Plumb full of everything that makes ARAH so good, lines the pages of this volume from start to finish.

Want all your favorite vehicles that you pushed around your living room carpet as a child in one 100 page offering? Get this volume. Want to have a bit of a G.I. JOE - Transformer crossover? Get this volume. You want to see Larry Hama lay rest to one of the JOE's best characters in the absolute best way possible. Get this volume!This volume is an incredible read. From start to finish, Larry Hama's creativity had me glued to each page as I watched the JOEs overcome a terrible threat from mechanical monsters, one of them controlled by one of the JOE's greatest enemies. But the true heart of this particular volume lies within the send off for one of the greatest characters ever created, the JOE universe aside. Sacrificing himself for the greater good and his closest friends, he is given page after page after page of tribute, fitting for someone of his grandness.This is without a doubt a brilliant collection of individual issues. My only wish had been that the story had slowed down just a tad in the beginning as some of the combat against the mech units was a little too fast.

"A little less than a year ago, I first heard that Karen Traviss was going to be writing for the JOE franchise. Having read her work in the Star Wars franchise and knowing that she is a more than capable writer, I was very excited to see what she could create in the JOE universe. This is mostly because she has an amazing ability to make her characters real. She does this by creating meaningful back stories, realistic personalities and abilities, and by giving them compelling and meaningful story arcs. Having this ability is something that she shares with the ARAH JOE creator, Larry Hama.However, the GI JOE created by Larry Hama is virtually nowhere to be found in the new IDW storyline. Yes, the JOE characters are present, and, yes, we also know that after years of IDW comics that these JOEs are not the ones we fell in love with in the eighties, but let there be no doubt that these JOEs in no way shape or form resemble the old JOEs.But pushing that aside, there are some great characters and great storylines within this issue. The characters are very mature, and the story is modern and unforgivingly real. This issue and the last read like a graphic novel based on a full fledged novel (something I wish Traviss would have been offered over a comic book storyline). The story is very fresh and original and pushed forward by great dialogue and intelligent world building. My only wish that this new JOE was actually that, new.With this new arch and this new feel, my opinion is that the tie to the Real American Hero world should have been severed and this production be called by a new name with new characters as this story really has nothing to do with the ARAH JOEs previously established. The other option is to have created a new JOE all together as done from the 60's JOEs and the 80's JOEs.So, in conclusion. This JOE is a great reimagining of the old JOE. With deep characters and realistic story arcs, Karen Traviss has brought a more adult feel to the Franchise. However, this isn't really a ""A Real American Hero GI JOE"" story and the only ties that bind it to the ARAH JOE are the character's names. Time for an actual reboot, or a renaming.Good book...not JOE.*Offered in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KJAP3YCPIQBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631403559#wasThisHelpful","R3KJAP3YCPIQBP","A19GTQ0YMXO8VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GTQ0YMXO8VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the end of Star Trek The Returned Part II, Peter David set the stage for the final battle between the forces he so carefully placed upon the chess board. Now, in Part III, we watch as those opponents square off in a nail-biting fight to the death.Meckenzie Calhoun, now free from his manic quest for genocide against those whom destroyed his race, is now face-to-face with his new enemy in an even more dangerous quest to prevent them from getting to the Milky Way Galaxy and to end their evil attempt to rid the Universe of all sentient life. Meanwhile, Robin Lefler and Mark Henry have now paired up in both their ongoing struggle against those who would see the death of young Prince Swan and against the all powerful Q. And last but not least, a once trusted crew member whom lost her trust and respect, works hard to regain it when life and death dangles by a thread.So the three main story arcs from the first two installments carry on into the third, but you may be asking why I would give this one only three stars when I gave the first to installments such high praise. Well, to be perfectly honest, Peter David crossed a line in this third one that I still have yet to forgive him for - and I read this over a month ago.In Part three, Peter David attempts to flip the script in many ways, both in story and in character plots. We watch as Mackenzie turned from being hellbent on destroying the race that destroyed his, only to be cut off at the knees by this new but extremely deadly force with incredibly well mannered speech. This introduction eventually showed Mackenzie the error in his genocidal rage, but it also took away his end purpose and taking away much of his purpose in the book. But that arch is the least of my complaints.Second is the interaction between Mackenzie and Soleta. It appears that Peter David didn't want to pull any punches in this trilogy and decided to push the envelope with his characters interactions. This event, which I won't describe in detail, was shocking to say the least. A violation so intense will leave some readers surprised at just how out of left field it is. But even though Soleta crosses a very wide line with Mackenzie, Peter David does find a way to sort things out in the end, and most is forgiven between the characters. But last is the offense I have yet to forgive.About half way through the book, Peter decides to push the envelope as far as it will go. Q and Mark Henry finally have their dual, a dual that Peter cleverly lays out in a way that harkens back to the old TNG TV days. But the interaction between Q and Henry is not where my issue lies, rather in an act that Q perpetrates on young Prince Swan in a scene that I will describe below. If you wish not to read the spoiler jump one paragraph down.In this scene, Q, as described by Peter, assaults young Swan in a very aggressive manner that is completely out of norm for Q. In a battle with Robin and Henry, Peter describes not only the dropping of the child but also the removal of the babies lungs, a scene that leaves the young child gasping for air with nonexistent organs. In all my years of following Trek and being a fan of Q, I have never known him to be cruel for cruel sake. This scene is way outside his established personality and has no place in his character. I'm not sure why Peter found it necessary to have this scene included, even though the ending of Part III tries to iron it out, but to me it is so over the top and not at all what Q is that it has left me offended to this very day.So, even though Part III has many issues that take some of the shine off of what Part II and Part I set up, it is still one of Peter David's better works. There are things I would have not done, and many things I would not have thought of, but in the end this series is true to what the New Frontier has always been...fun.A decent ending to the series.

"When shopping for protein powders there are a few things that are always questioned. First, does this actually absorb into whatever we are mixing it into? And, yes, it does mix well with liquid. Second, does it taste okay? I used this with milk and was quite surprised on just how much it tasted like chocolate milk even though it isn't labeled as such. It has a rich, natural taste that doesn't taste like chalk or chemicals. Third, does it have an aftertaste? No, not really. It does leave traces if you heavily mix it into whatever liquid you choose, but washing it down isn't an issue. Forth, does it actually work? This is where I cannot give you an answer. I take protein powders to help with my extreme metabolism and add weight I wouldn't otherwise maintain, but because I also have Pyroluria, I am also very sensitive to copper, so much so that I cannot often drink well-water because of its copper levels. I think that is why I react badly to this product because it is farmed with copper levels that exceed my personal limits. But even though this doesn't work well with my health condition, I know that if it did it would be my protein powder of choice. With its rich taste and its ability to easily mix well with milk, I would choose this over all other brands.*I received this item in exchange for an honest opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17RPO4VL0LJ5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFR695W#wasThisHelpful","R17RPO4VL0LJ5L","A19GTQ0YMXO8VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GTQ0YMXO8VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"]Minor Plot Spoilers Ahead[At the end of The Returned Part I, we left off with Mackenzie Calhoun and the crew of the Excalibur successfully navigating their way through a wormhole and into a previously unexplored pocket universe. Once through, the crew find Mackenzie's arch enemies, the D'myurj, ruthlessly slain by a yet unknown enemy force. Now, surrounded by the broken corpses of those he, himself, came to slay, he is now faced with an even greater threat to himself, his crew, and potentially the universe from which he came. Who are these savage beings able to reap such destruction upon the race that slaughtered his own kind? Will he and his crew face the same fate as the Excalibur sensors pick up an incoming ship on long range sensors? And will this new threat end his quest for vengeance?But the questions that surround Mackenzie Calhoun are just one of three major storylines that The Returned Part II offers. Back home in the Milky Way galaxy, Robin Lefler and Mark Henry also have their fair share of going-ons, as Robin and Mark continue to repel the enemies of the young prince Swan. New found attractions and the acts of kindness open new doors for the duo along the way, too. And power struggles and fate twist the futures of many once and future kings, as The Awesome hand picks the head unto which the crown sits.But danger on the horizon is far from the only thing that The Returned Part II has to offer, as Peter David intertwines his usual sense of humor, suspense, and out-of-nowhere plot twists along the way. You think you were surprised at the cliffhanger in Part I, well just wait til you see the cliffhanger ending in Part II!The Returned Part II is a great second entry in to the three part series and builds a lot of suspense and anticipation for Part III, but I would be failing as a reviewer if I did not point out some of the shortcomings of the second installment. For me the Calhoun story, and the Lefler story are great story arcs, my issue is with the enemies that Mr. David has created in this offering. The savage and barbaric enemy force that Calhoun is now faced with reads very unevilish (and, yes, I know that isn't a word). In fact every enemy in this pocket universe(and sometimes out of it) is the nicest group of mass-murders one can think of. They read the polar opposite of what every evil villain that has come before should read as. And, yes, Peter David does create his characters to be vastly different than most found in other books, and that is why we love him, but here they read off. Now this makes for a more threatening force when the enemies contradict their established ways, but to me anyways, I would have preferred a slightly less non-threatening cast of villainy.Overall, I love this second installment and look forward to the third with great anticipation.

"Star Trek The More Things Change is at its core, a one act play set on a single stage. When a Trill commissioner takes ill it is the responsibility of both Spock and Doctor Christine Chapel to race her to medical help aboard a Trill star ship. But nothing can ever be so easy in the Star Trek franchise, as a mysterious foe attempts to halt their shuttle and board them. It is Spock that must keep the small shuttle space-worthy and on course to their Trill rescuers, and Doctor Chapel whom must keep her patient alive long enough to reach them.Written in novella form (short story), Star Trek The More Things Change focuses heavily on three main story arcs. The first is that the small three person group must get to their destination. This simple act makes for compelling storytelling as it focuses the reader on a simple aspect of the story and resists overextending the book into filler. It also connects the reader more strongly to the characters and their personalities, trials, and tribulations. In a more focused story, the reader gets to delve deeper into the characters inner thoughts, feelings, and connections to their world.The second story arc is the setting. With ninety-five percent of the book set within the confines of the shuttle, the story leaves behind complex story arcs and focuses the reader on a single environment. This single stage also allows for the environment itself to become a character. In this book the shuttle's constant need for mechanical repair, and the constant barrage of fire it is under, make it a source for sympathy for the reader. Will it hold out long enough to reach its destination? Will Spock be able to keep it alive long enough to carry it precious cargo to safety?And of course the third major story arc is the predator constantly stocking them for no apparent reason. This story arc will be the cliff hanger, the climatic mountain that sets up the finale. In the end we see just who this faceless, nameless enemy is, and the revelation is in tone with the Trek universe.So even though this book is short in nature, it is big in story. Secrets are revealed, love is found and lost, life is protected, and the evil foe meets their destiny. Some may find the one stage environment a little claustrophobic, but I found it refreshing as a reader and appreciated the focus it gave the story. My only issue with the book is that the ending surrounding the enemy battle seemed to be clipped a little too fast and neat. Perhaps an extended battle scene that drew out the finale just a tad bit more would have been fitting.All-in-all a good read.

"The Clone Wars era has never been a huge draw for me, but that time frame does has a few big characters that can get even the most casual Star Wars fan excited; one being Darth Maul, the other being Asajj Ventress.Asajj, the once Sith apprentice of Count Dooku and member of the Nightsisters, saw her storyline vanish into thin air as The Clone Wars cartoon left the airwaves. But despite the cartoon's cancellation, Asajj fans demanded a continuation to her story. With that, author Christie Golden was tasked to bring Asajj's cartoon tale to print form.Long time readers of the Star Wars franchise know that Christie Golden is no stranger to the SW universe given her prior introduction near the end of the old EU and scheduled, but canceled, release of the Jiana Solo stories that were to take place after the events of the Fate of the Jedi series. Readers of her prior work, both in the Star Wars franchise and outside of it, know that her talents are best used when focusing on more heartfelt tales. So, with that in mind, we should find, and in my opinion do find, that the combination of a previously written tale for Asajj by the cartoon crew and Christie Golden's writing skills make for a deep and meaningful tale.]General plot points ahead with very minor spoilers[The tale itself is a simple premise. The Jedi council, faced with the prospects of losing the Clone War to Count Dooku and his yet unknown Master, are forced to consider a more confrontational plan of action. A Jedi, a master Jedi, must be chosen to hunt down Dooku and end his reign of terror. It is this plan that is the root of the book: and it is a story that will test not only the resolve of the Jedi Council, but of the reader themselves. But hunting down the elusive and powerful fallen Jedi will be no easy task. But there is one whom can make the nearly impossible possible, and that one is Asajj Ventress.]More aggressive plot points ahead with some spoilers along the way[I will not be giving away the whole plot of the book in this review, but there are plot points and story arcs that must be addressed. First is the root story of the book, the plot to hunt down Dooku. This plot idea, in my opinion, is a strong one. It is a plot idea that we haven't quite seen in a Jedi driven tale before. Now, to refrain from giving the whole plot away, I will just say that the premise of the Jedi ""hunting"" down Count Dooku is one that must be handled with great care and sensitivity. The Jedi we know and love have centuries of tradition and moral restraint that must be adhered to. For me, I can sense that both the cartoon writers and Christie Golden had trouble maintaining tradition but also executing the plan. The book struggles to find the balance between the Jedi code and the action needed to be taken to save millions, if not billions, of lives. It is this struggle that will surprise some readers with just how far some Masters will fall to achieve the goal, and it will surprise even more with just how far the Council will join in that descent.But this struggle to maintain a moral balance in the Council's plan radiates outward to every main character in the book as well. I sense that some readers will be tasked with the roller coaster feel as the main characters seem to switch their loyalties like the sides of a coin flipping through the air. But where some of this unbalance harms the book, it also helps it in a way. At the core of the book is a love story, a love story that reflects what most love stories do...tragedy.But one can not have a one sided relationship. In comes Master Vos.Vos is a little known Jedi both to fans and to other characters in the book. He is a man that lives in the shadows, an infiltrator, a spy. It is these talents that make him the perfect candidate to connect with the once apprentice of his main target, and connect they do. It is this interaction that will have many readers guessing until the end. Is Vos's unique talent to infiltrate just a tactic to win his way to Dooku through Ventress? Is his willingness to follow her into darkness a ploy to attain his goal? Will his brush with the darkside end his connection to the Jedi way or is it just another avenue to ending the savage reign of the Count.It is this imbalance, this willingness to swap loyalties that will both infuriate and intrigue readers. Just how far will the main characters and the Council fall down the rabbit hole before they lose the war and themselves? Will you side with the tactics needed to achieve peace or will you reject the premise that the ends justify the means? But whatever choice you make as a reader, the story has some surprises along the way. Some will make you mad, some will make you happy. Some will pull at your heart strings and others will leave you an emotional mess. But at the end of the day that is what books are for and some measure that emotional tug of war as a measure of just how good a book can be.A good book with meaningful story arcs, but a book that , at times, struggles to properly set up those arcs and stay connected to events that happen later in the franchise.A good book.

"It's the return of Mackenzie Calhoun, the fearless Captain of the USS Excalibur and husband to Starfleet Admiral, Elizabeth Shelby. But what Captain Calhoun returns to is emptiness. The kind of emptiness that can torture an ordinary man's soul. The kind of emptiness that can crush an ordinary man's spirit. But Mackenzie Calhoun is no ordinary man, he is the man thrust into the folds of rebellion after witnessing his father's execution. He is the man that liberates his home world from evil oppressors at the mere age of 20. And he is the man who will reap his revenge upon the ones that slaughtered his people.But the road to vengeance must start somewhere, sometime. And what better place than here on the barren surface of Xenex? What better time than now? Surrounded by the memories of a planet once full of life, Mackenzie Calhoun can only now look over the desolate land in search for any indication that one, if he could be only so lucky to find one, a single survivor beyond himself. But the extinction of his people is undeniable, he is the last, the only, a fact that is only accepted after it is carried to his ears by the voice of his wife. But with acceptance comes action, and with Mackenzie Calhoun action is only a matter of time.Time. It is the force that controls the past, the present, the future. It's linear heritage spans countless generations before and will span countless generations after the flash in the pan that is Mackenzie Calhoun. However, time's iron like grip on the events of the universe is not without weakness, without manipulation. And it is with that knowledge that Mackenzie Calhoun finds himself staring at the Guardian.It is the mechanical construct left behind by some long forgotten alien race. It is the mechanical construct that is the key to unlocking the future return of his people. Oh how easy it would be to simply walk back in time and warn his people of the coming doom. To prepare them for the war that is about to be upon them. But why stop there when the options are limitless? But time is a beast not easily tamed. One right move could save his people, while one wrong move could cost them much more than just their lives. It is a tough choice to make. Will he risk the timeline to save his people, or will time retain the memories of the past?But Mackenzie Calhoun will not be the only one faced with hard choices. Will the proud Starfleet Admiral put her career on the line for marriage and love? Will a once Romulan spy recover from her permanent slumber and awaken only to violate her loyalties to her new crew? Will the son of a mother be turned over to murders to be raised as their leader? And will the son of a father succeed in his quest to murder the one that created him?These are just a few of the many questions that Peter David lays out in the first installment of The Returned. You will read as leaders return to the positions they rightfully hold. The return of crewmen once feared gone to illness, injury, or ascension. The return of unimaginable threats only to find there are bigger and badder predators beyond the shadows. But most of all, you will watch as one of the most prolific authors returns to what he does best, create.A stellar story that reads true to past works.*Product offered in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21T1TJ6M45J1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URY5CYI#wasThisHelpful","R21T1TJ6M45J1I","A19GTQ0YMXO8VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GTQ0YMXO8VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In years gone by, we as Star Wars fans have been tempted by fancy covers and advertisements for books featuring the dark Lords of the Sith taking leading roles in 300 plus page books. And, of course, once we crack the covers of those books, we find stories heavily geared towards other characters and superficial, stereotypical tales of our favorite villains only getting a few chapters along the way. Here, in Lords of the Sith, written by Paul S. Kemp, we actually get what the cover and the ads have promised.Lords of the Sith is one of few books that actually provides a story for the dark Lords and gives progress to their characters. With a compelling storyline and in depth character interaction, Lords breaks the mold of stories past and leaves behind the stereotypical dark cloud riding in to correct the failings of pathetic imperial  officers and incompetent stormtroopers.Warning  Minor Plot detail ahead.The story: Lords main focus takes place soon after the budding rebellion takes root. The tide is beginning to turn for the Imperial power share, and the Emperor has taken note. Always a seer of coming events, the Emperor leaves the safety of deep Imperial space and joins Lord Vader on a trip to the new front lines  an unusual occurrence to say the least.Meanwhile, a group of Twi'lek rebels, lead by the father of the new rebellion  and the father of someone else we know well  has been given intelligence of the coming visit. This is the opportunity he has been waiting years for, the opportunity to strike a heavy blow to the Empire. But destroying an Imperial Star Destroyer carrying a diplomatic contingent would be a great blow, destroying an Imperial Star Destroyer carrying the Emperor and Lord Vader themselves would be a death blow, and this is that opportunity delivered hot and fresh.The goods: Lords, with Paul S. Kemp at the helm, delivers meaningful characters that leap from the page, but, where most Star Wars books fail, Kemp is able to deliver compelling character descriptions and tales to the darker side of the Force as well. The Emperor is no longer the evil old man relegated to the confines of his chair on the death star bellowing dark orders and mystery with an evil laugh. Here in Lords, we watch as the Emperor himself takes an active role in the story and channels a sort of Yoda-esk quality along the way through action packed fighting scenes and Force frenzies. But beyond a more physical story for the Emperor, we also see a more personal side as well with his old friend Vader. As the story progresses, we watch as Kemp explores both the rule of two and long history between the two characters.The bads: I think most readers will be absorbed by the first half of the book. The Twi'lek storyline is fast paced, action packed, meaningful, and has a bunch of hidden Easter eggs for the devote fans amongst us. But I also believe most fans will be somewhat disappointed as the book crosses the fifty percent mark as the action and depth start to fade away as compelling story arcs give way to more lackluster bug chases and cave dwelling fight scenes. Although the book is still good with the lesser climatic storylines in the later half, this bridge from the first half of the book may be a little hard for some readers to cross. This transition from first half to second half also sets up for a less compelling finale, as the characters that were the main feature of the first half have been somewhat absent in the arc of the second, an absence that hurts what should have been a more meaningful ending.Overall, Lords, is one of the better books that has been released recently. In my opinion this one is the best since Kenobi, and is very deserving of a read by both fanatic fans and the occasional visitor. Perhaps it could have used a little more editing and a little more focus near the end, but don't let that dissuade you from giving it a read.Five stars and a standing ovation for Paul S. Kemp.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29MR3FJN9ZC6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MKZ3VUY#wasThisHelpful","R29MR3FJN9ZC6I","A19GTQ0YMXO8VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GTQ0YMXO8VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think the most asked question about this book will be, ""Is this book anything like I, Jedi?"" and that is a fair question to ask. Given that I, Jedi set the standard for first-person perspective writing in the old EU, it is the foundation for first-person books written after, and I guess the short answer to that question would have to be no, but that doesn't make it bad.Heir to the Jedi is set in the era between Ep IV and V, and continues to tell the tale of young Luke Skywalker. In this time period, Luke is still that young farm boy from Tatooine, full of gung-ho spirit but also naivete. This is where Heir to the Jedi's story comes into play. Most, I feel, will not really take to this book because it reads thin, almost sophomoric, especially for an accomplished writer. But once you have finished the book, I think you will come to the same conclusion that I have and see that this lack of deep plotting better serves the time frame, and immaturity of Luke, that the story takes place around.The story itself revolves around Luke teaming up with a young woman to track down and rescue a brilliant mathematician before the evil Empire can get their hands on her. Overall this story is somewhat lackluster on itself, but if you walk into it with somewhat low expectations, the book will read like a rainy day book instead of a must read. Now some may find that unexceptable and be critical of it, but in the end the book is really neither really good nor really bad...it's okay good.The strong points offered can be found in Luke's inner thoughts. Again, given the time frame don't expect anything too deep, but do expect to see Luke from a different perspective than most books can give. Another strong point is seeing things from Luke's point of view.Some of the book's low points would be around a somewhat forced love interest that seems rushed and very thinly setup. The book feels very one sided given it's first person perspective, but I'm sure more points of view could have been provided through better dialogue. The author had a firm grasp on the characters written, but the story itself neither provided them avenues for greatness nor deep enough plots to make the reader connect to them when they were lost.For me this book fits in okay with the other Empire and Rebellion books. Given that this series of books is neither blockbuster nor gangbuster, it fits in just fine.Read it. Expect little going in.

"Upon receiving this item, there were three main questions I had for this item. The first is, will this item maintain an already chilled liquid and for how long? The second was, will this chill a liquid that is at room temperature and by how much? The third was, will this item leave an aftertaste if left in the liquid? So lets break down each question in a more in depth way.Question 1: Will this help maintain a liquids already chilled temp and for how long.I took two bottles of tap water and placed them in the refer over night. I also did the same with the Vinomio Chiller in the freezer. I then placed both bottles on the table at room temperature and measured one with the Chiller and one with out over a span of four hours...and here are the results.Room Temp was 62.5 degrees.Hour 0: Water temp was 36 degrees.Hour 1: Without the Chiller was 47 degrees. With the Chiller was 44 degrees.Hour 2: Without the Chiller was 53 degrees. With the Chiller was 52 degrees.Hour 3: Without the Chiller was 59 degrees. With the Chiller was 59 degrees.As you can see by the results, the Chiller has little effect maintaining temperature over a span of three hours, but that is not unreasonable, here is why. Room temperature is constant and will continue to transfer that constant temp to a chilled item. Without a constant reintroduction of a lower temp item, the water will continue to rise. Given this Chiller rod is very small and is covered in Stainless Steel, the temperature of the room will overpower the ability of the rod in short order. I think a better test is how much heat transfer will occur when warm water is ""chilled"" by a cooler rod, so let's test it.I allowed a bottle of water to reach room temperature over night and also placed the Chiller back in the freezer over night, too. Then the next day, I placed the rod in the room temperature water to see how much the water will cool and how long it will take it to chill to its max limit. Here are the results.Hour 0: Water temp 62 degrees. Then placed the frozen rod in the water.5 Min later: 57 degrees10 Min later: 57 degrees15 Min Later: 58 degrees20 Min Later: 59 degrees30 Min later: 61 Degrees40 Min later: 62 DegreesSo the Chiller can reduce the water by 5 degrees and hold it at a lower temp for 40 minutes.And finally, will this leave an aftertaste? No, it does not.As you can see by the test results above, the Chiller has some effect, but little at best. So where does that leave us? Well, for the most part, the Chiller does not meet its advertised promise of ""Keeps your wine chilled to perfection"" and is better than a dripping pan that bottles are usually kept in. Perhaps in regards to being a cleaner, no-drip, item, the Chiller is better, but given its small size one should not expect either a large chilling effect or a chilling effect that lasts over a long period of time.And I think that is where the problem lies, the Chiller is just too small to handle any amount of fluid much larger than itself. There are items that are similar to this that may work better, such as stainless steel ice cubes that can better chill fluid because of their size in comparison to the amount of fluid placed around them...but I'll leave those tests and comparisons to you.In short, the Chiller works, but not to the limits on would expect.A solid three stars from me.*I received this item in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AOI5CTLA9RFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJ7BMBS#wasThisHelpful","R3AOI5CTLA9RFC","A19GTQ0YMXO8VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GTQ0YMXO8VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is hard to review a Volume presentation of completely different works, but I will try. The story begins when the Turtles are thrown back in time. It is difficult to explain why as there is little story explaining what has happened to cause this. As the story continues one would think that this is fleshed out, however, the writers really abandon this plot point. In fact, the writers seem to abandon just about everything they set up.Not only are plot points abandoned but any sense of common thread is thrown out the window as well. The artwork moves from a focus on a very young audience to a much older one and everyone in between. With scenes that look like they are better suited for coloring books, to scenes that look they should be in a graphic novel, there is no sense of continuity between the presentations. The story follows close suit, as the plots are muddled and disjointed between issues and usually end without concluding the actual story.It appears to me that there was no actual game plan for this series. Almost as if the people creating it split up into different teams and didn't communicate what the plan was with each other, all coming up with a different end product.Skip this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQS4GQNQ538G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631401815#wasThisHelpful","ROQS4GQNQ538G","A19GTQ0YMXO8VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GTQ0YMXO8VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OK, take this from a lover of all things Apple... This is really a great TV box. The software is admittedly new, but is already pretty darn good, especially for a first-generation device. I have two non-smart TVs. For one, I have an Apple TV, which is untouchable due to the Airplay and iCloud features... if you are invested in the Apple ecosystem at all, you need at least one Apple TV in your house for this reason. For the other TV, I used to have the latest and greatest Roku (Roku 3, I think it was... I can't tell now because I hit it with a hammer too many times). That was my second Roku, bought to replace my first one which had a terrible problem where it was somehow injecting a constant hum into my sound system. The new Roku had no hum, and performed quite well, except IT WOULDN'T STAY CONNECTED TO MY WIFI NETWORK. It was the most frustrating thing ever, and I tried every single solution I could think of, even changing encryption and channels on my wireless router about 10 times. I was resetting everything on a nightly basis to get it to work, and even that only worked half the time. I finally got just too frustrated, and demolished the Roku 3, and now I will never purchase a Roku device again.Anyways, on to the device that I'm supposed to be reviewing. The Amazon Fire TV went on a cyber monday sale for half price, and I must say it was a steal at that price. It came setup with my Amazon account already, which was nice and convenient. The WiFi performs as good or better than the Apple TV, and lightyears better than either Roku before it. I have not had any connectivity issues with it, except in WatchESPN, but I'm pretty sure that's an ESPN problem. It is the fastest by far at loading videos. Amazon videos somehow start playing instantly (it's like magic, I swear), while videos from other sources take a few seconds at most to begin playing. The remote is good, but not great. The voice search is also very good, but I wish it could reach into more apps. Gaming is nothing special, but this would be an easy and cheap way to trick young kids into thinking you bought them a real gaming console. I like how slim the box is... for a wall-mounted TV it would be preferable to mount to the back of the TV itself, since the remote does not require line of sight to function. The packaging was very nice, even better than typical Amazon stuff in my opinion. I have not had a single hiccup with the software... no bugs, no freezes, no crashes. Honestly, if it weren't for the Airplay and iCloud integration I mentioned above, I would probably replace my Apple TV with another one of these. Sure, it prioritizes Amazon content over other content, but I don't hold that against them. It is still just as easy to access Netflix on this device as on anything else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HH0MN9TG737S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX5P8FC#wasThisHelpful","R3HH0MN9TG737S","AB14E2B41RF36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB14E2B41RF36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow. I got these phones bundled with a Tascam DR-05 recorder for the price of the headphones alone. I ordered the bundle more for the recorder, but the headphones are certainly the more impressive of the two items. These will bring out things you've never heard before in music that you've heard a hundred times over. When I made uncompressed recordings with the DR-05, I had a hard time telling the difference between live sound and recorded sound when I closed my eyes. These headphones seem to be very unbiased and flat in response. They have no distortion at any volume. The passive noise cancellation is even surprisingly good. Low sound bleed as long as they are sealed up nice around your ears (still some bleed at extreme volumes though). The sound quality is almost too good sometimes -- you will start to notice imperfections in professionally-produced music with these. I really can't think of a better pair of headphones for anywhere close to this price. I love the cable selection (which adds a lot of value... they are usually the first thing to go bad in my experience) and the carry pouch. The white color is a very pure white -- I am afraid to get them dirty. It looks nice, but I would go with black if ordering again. They are more comfortable, durable, and flexible than any other over-ear headphones I've owned, and I've owned quite a few. Every time I let a friend try these out, they have one of two initial reactions, depending on the type of music being demoed... 1) a slight backwards tilt of the head, with eyes slowly closing and a smug grin that slowly widens [most common with classical music], or 2) an apparent paralysis of everything but the face, which develops sharply raised eyebrows and a slight jaw-drop [usually rap or electronic/dance].Yeah, get these headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MXR23KJ7VR23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVLURL8#wasThisHelpful","R1MXR23KJ7VR23","AB14E2B41RF36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB14E2B41RF36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this device bundled with the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x headphones for the selling price of the headphones alone, so I was happy with the deal even before trying the products out. Now that I have put them through their paces, I can't believe I basically got this device for free. It has met or exceeded all of my expectations. Specifically, the built-in stereo condenser mics are way better than I expected. I have used many condenser mics before, and background noise is almost always an issue (unless you're in a professional studio or something). If you're more than a few inches from a condenser, you have to crank up the trim such that you can hear people on the other side of the room breathing through the mix. If you place them too close, they seem to become exponentially more sensitive and peak out too easily. That's where I was surprised with this device... The response curve seems much more gradual, and a nice range of input level is provided, such that placing the mic just a few inches from the source (in my case, an acoustic guitar, cajon, and several other instruments) becomes very easy to mix while reducing background noise almost entirely. I even recorded some electric guitar from my fender tube amp, and placed right next to the speaker, this thing performed like a champ.The mics are very natural and neutral -- flat, in a good way. Combined with the excellent M50x studio reference headphones, when I recorded anything from voices to instruments to random ambient noise, upon playback I could close my eyes and honestly would have a hard time telling the difference between live sound and recorded sound. Of course, this is only when recording uncompressed... Switch to mp3 format and even a little compression sounds terrible on those headphones. The interface is not that bad compared to other recording devices. It only took me a few minutes to get a hang of all the controls. People expecting this to be like an iPhone in ease of use will be disappointed, though. The batteries last forever, the microSD card slot is easy to access, and everything is quick and simple with this thing. Seems durable enough as long as you're not dropping it on concrete. I also received a 4GB card instead of the 2GB that was advertised. No complaints here :DAs another reviewer or two have explained, there is a software upgrade from the manufacturer's website which adds some nice features to this already-excellent device. The most notable feature is the overdubbing. After updating, while the monitor mix is turned on, you can press record and select whether or not to overdub the current track. If you opt to overdub, the current track will play through the headphone jack, while you record over it. The original track is kept, along with the overdubbed version. As far as I can tell, once overdubbed, there is no way to isolate the new track from the one you dubbed over (in order to mix as separate tracks). So, while this isn't really a multi-track recorder, it is actually quite simple to perform basic multi-track recordings, as long as you don't need to do much post-production. You can even add in reverb (either at the input or the output), so I was able to record full song samples with a blending reverb effect all on this device, onto one track. The only mixing I did was live, and if I didn't like my last track, I would just redo it.So, yeah, this thing is worth the money, especially in the bundle that I got. This isn't exactly professional-level equipment, but it's close enough for those who just want a decent quality recording without breaking the bank, even for someone who is very picky like me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZCLO5K0VI0SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OU2IQG#wasThisHelpful","R1ZCLO5K0VI0SR","AB14E2B41RF36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB14E2B41RF36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent watch. Was delivered in a very nice box, and was already set to the proper time, accurate to the minute. My wife absolutely loved getting it for her birthday and thought it was the perfect gift. The colors are nice and it goes with a lot of different styles of clothing and accessories. While it looks dainty, both the band and the watch itself feel fairly solid and durable. The leather band of course is quite stiff, causing it to tend to fall to the sides of the wrist, but it will get softer and more broken in over time.

"This thing is really nothing special, but it has a nice, sharp dot with plenty of brightness levels. It mounts nice and solid, and I didn't have any problems getting it sighted in either. I used it with the excellent Lucid M7 riser on a custom built super-lightweight AR-15, and the whole thing fully loaded weighs less than 5lb, which is amazing. Obviously, with no magnification, you're very limited on range (even when shooting from a rest because the dot starts to cover your target completely at long distance). However, this is a great multi-purpose red dot. I will probably end up putting it on my Vepr-12 shotgun and get something magnifying for my AR. For both-eyes-open defensive shooting, this thing will do just fine!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BZS4AYX17Q40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00200E0HM#wasThisHelpful","R2BZS4AYX17Q40","AB14E2B41RF36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB14E2B41RF36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I don't have a Lucid M7, I bought this because it looks sleek, won't break the bank, and appears to be one of the lighter full-height riser options on the market. I recently built an AR-15 that weighs less than 4 pounds, so I didn't want to defeat the purpose by putting a heavy optics rig on it. As a test run, I paired this with the Bushnell Trophy red dot and it is a very decent rig for the money. I plan upgrading the optic at some point (aimpoint micro H-1), but this riser is probably here to stay. It is a solid product from a solid company.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34SRYCUJ373N3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D1HQA8A#wasThisHelpful","R34SRYCUJ373N3","AB14E2B41RF36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB14E2B41RF36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've only had this for a few days, but considering the price, this has already far surpassed my expectations. I cannot speak much yet to the longevity or durability, but this thing absolutely sucks balls... balls of lint, dust, hair, etc. I vacuum quite frequently, and up until now I have been using a Roomba with the aerovac bin for regular scheduled sweeps, and a nicer hoover upright model for deep cleans about once per week. When I got this, I made the initial pass through a few rooms in the house... The dust bin was PACKED after running through just three bedrooms and a small hallway. This vacuum seems to be picking up so much more dust that has been left behind by years for other more expensive vacuums. Sure, this one lacks some of the nicer features, but even if it only lasts me a year or two, the cleaning ability is impressive. It gets edges quite well, and the turbo brush is nice for stairs. It's also super easy to empty the dust bin. I really don't think any fancy features are worth paying at least twice as much for a vacuum, when you can get a good basic clean for this price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHMZM8JQ0BJGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZBIZTW#wasThisHelpful","RHMZM8JQ0BJGZ","AB14E2B41RF36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB14E2B41RF36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I leave this in my car and it works quite well. After pairing, it automatically connects to my phone when I turn the car on, and as far as I can tell is just as good as having integrated bluetooth in the car. My only issue (and I think I must have bought a lemon) is that it will not work in cold weather. It turns on but the display flickers and it does not transmit an FM signal. The bluetooth usually connects right away, but it the transmitter won't work until my car warms up. This is slightly annoying but I probably got a bad unit, I was just too lazy to return it or anything. When it works, it sounds great through my radio. It even automatically starts playing music when I get in the car, which is cool in conjunction with iTunes radio (plays where you left off, or just shuffles your library if nothing was playing before).

"This TV certainly has rough edges and will not live up to the Samsungs, LGs, and Sharps of the world, especially from a user-interface standpoint. However, considering the relatively dirt-cheap price, it is more than worth it for those who want to get a headstart into the 4K world. I got pretty decent picture quality out of the box with OTA broadcast signals, and excellent picture quality from my 1080p Apple TV. I am actually rather impressed with the quality of the 4K upscaling, especially with the Apple TV signal. It really does look better than native 1080p, though it doesn't look nearly as good as native 4K. I have tinkered with the settings a little bit but I didn't have to do a firmware upgrade. Maybe mine was already upgraded?Anyways, to get on to the big issue here... No support for HDMI 2.0 yet, so with native 4K you're limited to 30Hz over HDMI. This is fine for movies because they are typically 24fps, but games and other video content will look inferior at 30Hz. Now, I have contacted Seiki customer service on two occasions, once by phone and once by email (via their weird online support system). Both times took longer than I would have liked, but at least I got responses. The guy on the phone told me confidently that the current models of their 4K TVs will support HDMI 2.0 by means of a future firmware upgrade. The email support response said that they are merely working to see if that is a possibility. So, there seems to be some ambiguity about whether this TV is actually as ""future-proof"" as it seems. I don't know enough about the technology to know whether it is possible to increase data throughput with a mere firmware upgrade, but since HDMI 2.0 will use the same cables as previous versions, I'd say this is quite possible and is likely a matter of the encoding/decoding scheme at both ends of the cable, rather than the hardware itself. The TV is obviously capable of 120Hz, so I tend to believe what the guy said on the phone. How long it will take to get this firmware upgrade, I have no idea. Even if HDMI 2.0 never pans out for this model, I'm still glad I bought it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBQTTYGXSCAVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXF7I9M#wasThisHelpful","RBQTTYGXSCAVG","AB14E2B41RF36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB14E2B41RF36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I agree with other reviews that say this model of the case suffered a dip in quality. However I still believe it is the best credit card iPhone case out there. My 5S has taken many tumbles and falls without suffering a single scratch (and no, I don't use a screen protector). I carry 4 cards in it without a problem (two licenses and two bank cards). They don't seem to move at all while in the case, unlike some wallet cases that are a bit more loose and can allow the cards to rub around and get messed up. It obviously adds some thickness, but those with bigger hands will appreciate getting more to hold on to (these phones are dumbtastically thin these days). Definitely not the cheapest good case out there, but it may be the most practical one of all since it can save you from carrying a wallet around altogether while not hindering the ease of using the phone at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22GOXWGNDI6XJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OWOFOM#wasThisHelpful","R22GOXWGNDI6XJ","AB14E2B41RF36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB14E2B41RF36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got a 50"" Seiki 4K TV for a heck of a deal, so I had to try plugging in a laptop to get some decent native 4K content.

"I reviewed the PD32 UE before, so this review will be similar in format. These two lights are very similar, and they are both near-perfect EDC/self-defense flashlights. The major difference here is the included batteries and charger with this light. I will say that they work just fine, and it's still a heck of a lot better than having to use the CR123A cells. Longer runtime and rechargeable with the 18650s, there's no reason to use CR123A batteries with this light unless you have to for some reason. However, there are better 18650 cells and chargers out there, but for the value these are fine because they work. On the PD35:Pros:-Awesome light output for size-Good battery life (considering output)-Tough but lightweight construction-Strobe accessible from any brightness setting-Strobes at the full 850 lumens (PD32 UE only strobes at 400)-Can be mounted on weapons with an attachment-Looks like a miniature lightsaber-Momentary or locking switch-Sturdy pocket/belt clipCons:-Doesn't remember strobe setting (i.e. can't activate immediately)-Does not come with the diffuser tip like the PD32 UE did-No S.O.S. mode like the PD32 UE-Wide beam angle doesn't throw too far-Can't tailstand-Gets hot quick on the highest setting-Lowest setting sometimes isn't low enoughComparing the beam to the PD32 UE, I noticed this one is slightly narrower and slightly cooler in color. I prefer the slightly narrower beam, because it throws a little farther, but I actually liked the warmer color of the PD32 UE a little better. This is mostly preference as the PD35 still has very good CRI (more like one of those 'daylight' CFL bulbs that just look a little too blue at night, but still renders colors very well).The brightness increase is barely noticeable except on the strobe setting. This light hurts to look at even on the lowest setting, so be careful when shining it at people. The strobe is especially disorienting, so please be sensitive to those around you.

"This product is one rattling buffer away from a 5-star rating. Really, that's my only complaint. I used it with a SigTac arm brace to make one heck of a sweet SBR... er... AR pistol. It was a pretty tight fit but nice and solid once on all the way. The included plate with sling loop is a nice touch. The weights in the buffer are apparently loose, but the assembly seemed to move quite smoothly. Cycled in my build with absolutely no hiccups. The price is fair enough.

"This is a solid piece. It does add some weight, but nothing crazy. I put it on a palmetto state upper with a midway AR stoner 7.5"" barrel and the thing shoots like a dream. The nut went on just perfectly, with just the right amount of torque. The handguard has nice texture in the middle for a good grip. I did notice that after I tightened the tube down to the nut as much as possible, it didn't take much normal handling to start coming loose from the nut again. You may need a pipe wrench to get it really tight, or better yet maybe just some loctite. Either way, I'd recommend this, especially considering the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20S30742EG244/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MHTFJG#wasThisHelpful","R20S30742EG244","AB14E2B41RF36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB14E2B41RF36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Few things in life are better than gourmet chocolate and Cailler LArt Du Brut Milk Chocolate Bar with Whole Almonds, Hazelnuts, and Cranberries is a chocolate bar made with quality in mind. The nuts, berries, and creamy chocolate make for a tasty after dinner or midday treat.I usually go for solid chocolate bars without any other ingredients, but I dont have any problem with the occasional deviation from my preference. This chocolate bar, with almonds, hazelnuts, and cranberries, offers a good tasting combination of ingredients that tastes better than expected. I wasnt so sure about cranberries in my chocolate, but the manufacturer makes it work. The hazelnuts and almonds are more pronounced and add more to the flavor than the cranberries, but the berry taste is still there, in a small but pleasant dose that contrasts nicely with the sweet chocolate.The nuts and berries are nice and add their own dimension of taste, but the basis of this candy is milk chocolate. Its creamy and smooth and it melts in your mouth the way quality chocolate should. The berries and nuts are actually softer than expected and, with the milk chocolate, make for a more delicate bite. And you can break the large bar into 12 small, bite size pieces, making it good for sharing.I love solid chocolate most of all, but I must say that Cailler LArt Du Brut Milk Chocolate Bar with Whole Almonds, Hazelnuts, and Cranberries is a very good alternative to 100 percent chocolate. The milk chocolate is still front and center, but the nuts and berries are tasty in their own right and make this a good- tasting, quality snack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG4YNXMJH5HUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGGIU#wasThisHelpful","RG4YNXMJH5HUT","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love any snack that includes chocolate and Popcorn brittle with Hersheys milk chocolate drizzle contains exactly that- milk chocolate drizzled over a mixture of snack foods for an indulgent treat great for the holidays or any time. The popcorn, toffee, pretzels, and chocolate combine for a taste most anyone will like and many will get addicted to quickly.This snack food relies on gooey but hardened/set toffee to hold together what are actually large pieces of candy. I had no problem grabbing one of these big pieces of snack food and eating the full piece, but some may want to break the pieces down into smaller sizes. The manufacturer claims that this candy is sweet and salty and it is, but the sweetness is most noticeable. The popcorn taste is there, too, and it tries to balance things out, but its the least pronounced among the flavors and sweetness dominates.I like this food item from a taste perspective and Im sure that others will agree that the taste is pleasant and indulgent. My concerns with this snack food are more along the lines of the nutrition. The sodium level is significant, although not as bad as other snack foods, and there are a fair number of calories that add up quickly because the candy is so easy to eat. But worst of all is the saturated fat. Each small serving contains about 5 grams of saturated fat and, considering how easy it is to eat multiple servings in a single sitting, the saturated fat catches up to you quickly.Popcorn brittle with Hersheys milk chocolate drizzle is a tasty snack overall and it would make a great gift. I think its a little pricey and I am concerned about the level of saturated fat. But this is still a tasty snack and besides, the holiday season is meant as a time to indulge so go ahead and enjoy this pretzel, popcorn, chocolate, and toffee treat if you get the chance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RU3ENG6F9Z0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013DT06FI#wasThisHelpful","R1RU3ENG6F9Z0O","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Homebrewing is a work of both science and art. Those new to the craft are usually content to learn the ropes and perfect a simple batch of brew using a homebrewing kit. But more advanced homebrewers want more, and one way to impress is by growing your own ingredients. Gardening for the Homebrewer is designed to aid the homebrewer in this important task.I have homebrewed beer in my day and I know that it can be a challenge to get everything just right. The addition of fresh ingredients is important and what could be fresher than growing your own? Thats what this book is all about. It steps the gardener through the process, from planting seeds, to harvest, to storage and beyond, with useful side tips and other advice to make your homebrew the best it can possibly be.One surprise with Gardening for the Homebrewer is that it isnt just about growing hops, barley, wheat, and other grains. It also has sections that cover growing grapes, apples, pears, and herbs. These sections are useful for those who wish to expand their horizons and produce their own wine and cider, or who would like to grow these ingredients to add to their own beer. There is even a section on making your own flavored liqueurs- something that, in turns out, is actually easier than it first sounds.I like how this book is written. I like the side tips that cover everything from pruning to cleaning and more. I also like the humor- you dont usually find humor in a gardening book, and it adds a nice touch. About the only thing this book could use is a conclusion. There is nothing to tie everything together at the end- the book just closes with a section on growing herbs.Homebrewing is a rewarding hobby. A great batch of homemade beer can be made even better with fresh ingredients and what could be fresher than growing your own? Gardening for the Homebrewer fulfills this purpose, showing homebrewers how to plant a garden of plenty to make the freshest, most natural beer possible. Even if you dont want to brew beer or make wine or cider, this is still a useful book that makes a great addition to the do-it-yourself persons library","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTPQ2ZVAREO0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0760345635#wasThisHelpful","RTPQ2ZVAREO0Y","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tissues are an essential item for home and office and Angel Soft is a brand I often turn to for my tissue and other bathroom needs. The quality of Angel Soft is good and the price is lower than most other brands- a combination that makes the brand a good choice in most instances.These tissues are more than good enough to satisfy most consumers. The tissues themselves are standard size and soft on the skin. They are not as soft as the tissues that contain added lotion or aloe, but they are still soft enough for most purposes. And the two ply design makes them strong enough to hold up to most noses.The other thing I like about this product is the package design, specifically the flat boxes. No, you dont get as many tissues with a flat box, but the design makes it easy to fit a box into a shallow desk drawer or other tight quarters. They work well in your car, too, and fit very well into the tissue- designated compartments common to some vehicles.Angel Soft Ultra Professional series products are designed for use in professional settings, but they can be used in the home as well. These tissues are as good as any other Angel Soft product and while the price is a little steep for ordinary consumers, it should fit within the budget of most businesses with no problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17FPHAJ8MTOA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4V31A2#wasThisHelpful","R17FPHAJ8MTOA9","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My girls love to ride their bicycles, but I have noticed that, gradually over the course of about a week, their tires lose a little bit of air. The leak isnt enough to warrant replacement tires/tubes, but the tires are in constant need of air and this compact pump from Kitbest is a good choice for the job.We have a couple different tire pumps in our household, but most are larger and bulkier- much more than is needed to pump air into a childs bicycle tire. Kitbest hand pump is noteworthy for its small size and it even attaches itself directly to a bicycle, so its always there when you need it. I would say the lightweight design and ability to attach to a bicycle are easily the devices strongest points.This pump is generally easy enough to use and it takes only a few back and forth pumps to get tires inflated and ready to go. One issue that I have with this pump, however, is the problem of getting it to firmly attach itself to the valves. I like that the pump has two different valve openings- one for shrader and one for presta valves- because this makes it more practical for general inflating needs. But getting the end of the pump to stay in place does take effort. If you dont get it right, you will know because you will pump and pump and notice that little or no air is getting into the tires. You will have to then unlock, reattach, and try again.Tire pumps are a necessity for those with bicycles and this mini pump from Kitbest is a good choice for most pumping needs. Like I said, the compact size and ability to mount it directly on a bicycle are its two strongest points. The problem with getting it to remain attached to a valve is not one to overlook, but it will work with effort and the pump has enough overall good qualities to recommend.Note: I received this product complimentary in exchange for an unbiased review, but I was not compensated in any way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPFC610YIGP4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011L3LVNY#wasThisHelpful","RPFC610YIGP4I","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Living near the Gulf coast, we receive a steady amount of rain. An umbrella is essential, but most of my umbrellas have been confiscated by my kids and I never know where they are. They take an umbrella with them when it rains, but they never return it to the same place. I needed a new umbrella to call my own and I was happy when I got my hands on the Travel Umbrella, from Oak Leaf.This umbrella I have is is black and that makes it perfect for a professional like me who sometimes needs an umbrella traveling to and from work. It comes with a protective sleeve in which to store, but I find this is really not necessary since the velcro strap keeps it firmly closed when not in use. The umbrella features an automatic, push button operation to open and it opens up smoothly and without any assistance. The cool thing is that it also closes automatically, with the push of the button, so you dont have to manually pull it down from the center, like you do with other umbrellas.This umbrella isnt huge, but its large enough to keep you and possibly a young child safe and dry. The water shakes off quickly and easily so it wont take long to dry. The handle is a decent size, but it would be nice if it was just a little bigger, at least for me since my hands are larger than average.Overall, I find this a very good umbrella with good functionality and quality construction. Its compact in size so it fits into small spaces for storage and the manufacturer even offers a lifetime guarantee. Im happy with this umbrella overall and recommended it to any dad who, like me, needs a way to stay dry in the rain but finds himself without protection due to the constant needs and forgetfulness of his youngsters.Note: I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for an unbiased review, but I was not compensated in any way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGL4JPU9FQBLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JTMLJQ#wasThisHelpful","RGL4JPU9FQBLO","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dogs love to eat and they especially love any food thats meaty in aroma. Eukanuba Adult Hearty Stew with Beef and Vegetables in Gravy is exactly that- a soft dog food that is loaded with real meat and certain to get any dogs attention.Wet dog foods are loved by dogs and this food from Eukanuba is much like other canned dog foods in that respect. Even if my dog is in another part of the house, he will quickly come running if I open a can of dog food. A dogs extraordinary sense of smell picks up on the fragrant aroma of meat and soft dog food sends my dog running to the dinner table with tail wagging. My dog loves the taste of this food and eats with abandon when its served to him.Just like with other wet dog foods, I tend to limit this canned dog food and serve as a topper to regular, dry food. I serve it as a treat more than a regular food and the reason is largely due to the ingredients. I like that meat comprises the top ingredients and Eukanuba should be commended for added a good dose of nutrition to this food. However, there are some by- products and a scattering of other questionable additives. Its still a notch better than some of the cheaper brands of canned dog food but some of the ingredients could concern the more attentive and demanding dog parent.Eukanuba is a generally trusted brand and its Adult Hearty Stew with Beef and Vegetables in Gravy is a good choice in wet dog foods.

"Solid Gold is a unique maker of pet foods and this particular style, Lamb, Sweet Potato, and Pea Grain and Gluten Free, is a good example of what this company can do. Its a food with balanced nutrition and with an ingredient list that includes a wide array of food items beneficial to dogs and their good health.Concerned dog owners are fully aware of the unhealthy and cost- saving fillers that comprise a large percentage of most dog foods. Some of these ingredients in cheaper dog foods are questionable at best, scary at worst. A quick check of the ingredient list with this food shows that its much better than most, with lamb, lamb meal, sweet potatoes, and chickpeas at the top of the list. There are some less- pronounceable items in the ingredients, but they rank well down the line.Do dogs like this food? I cant speak for all dogs but my vizla/shepherd mix took to this food right away. He didnt need any encouragement to eat and finish his bowl and this was a relief, because Im never completely sure if he is going to accept some of these natural/gourmet dog foods or not.

Some are much better than others and Solid Gold Sunday Sunrise Lamb, Sweet Potato, and Pea Grain and Gluten Free is definitely one of them.

"Im a chocolate fiend. I prefer chocolate to any other form of candy and will go out of my way to taste and enjoy any exotic or interesting form of this tropically- grown treat. Cailler LEcorce Dark Chocolate is one such treat- a chocolate great for snacking and indulgence.The first thing you will notice about Cailler LEcorce Dark Chocolate is that its flavor is less sweet and less smooth than other chocolate. Most of us are familiar with milk chocolate, which is creamier and usually sweeter. With Cailler LEcorce Dark Chocolate, you get a more bittersweet flavor that emphasizes pure cocoa. It might even seem a little harsh in taste for some people, but lovers of pure chocolate will find it delightful. And compared to some other examples of dark chocolate, this one is actually less harsh and a little smoother, although it is still not as smooth as the more common forms chocolate most of the public is accustomed to.This chocolate bar is flat, like a Hershey chocolate bar, but there is quite a bit of taste and calories packed into this small space. Purists, as stated before, will like it and appreciate that there are only a few ingredients: Chocolate, cocoa butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract. In fact, according to the manufacturers own numbers, this chocolate contains 84 percent pure cocoa. It easily comes through in the taste, which is chocolatey and natural, with only a few additives.Cailler LEcorce Dark Chocolate isnt the absolute greatest tasting dark chocolate I have ever tasted, but its easily above average and it will easily satisfy your chocolate cravings. Each bar is intended to share, but I usually indulge and down a full bar by myself. Its rich and bittersweet and a great chocolate indulgence for the chocolate fiends among us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VYT1U3BX1XV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGKLS#wasThisHelpful","R2VYT1U3BX1XV6","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone needs to keep food and beverages items cool at some point but when all you have is an individual lunch, a traditional cooler- even a small one- is more than necessary. You could just add an ice pack to your lunch box, but a better option is Packit Freezable Lunch Bag.I often take my kiddos to sports practices and we need cold drinks to get us through. This was enough to convince me that the Packit Freezable Lunch Bag was a good item to add to our household. And for our uses, it has come in very handy. You just stick it in the freezer and let it do its thing. The gel inside the walls of the bags freezes and is then ready for use. You dont need dig through the freezer in search of an ice pack because the frozen gel will do the work for you. Just remove from the freezer, unfold, add your food and drink, and zip shut.Packit has worked fine for our sports practice events because we are not gone for very long anyway. The only caution one needs to take is with extended time periods. If you take this to work, it should be fine keeping things cold for several hours, which is more than enough to get you to your lunch break. But if your lunch break is beyond, say, 7 hours from the time you leave home, the gel will likely have started to defrost and your items may not be as cold as you like. But even at this point, food and drink will likely still be cold enough to enjoy.The interior of Packit isnt very large, so dont expect it to hold more than approximately a single lunch. You also need to exercise some common sense and avoid leaving it in direct sunlight or inside a car because, if you do, the gel will defrost much more quickly. I cant judge the durability of this item because I have only been using it for a short time, but for my familys use, its a good, reliable, and useful aid to colder food and beverages and a convenient addition to our kitchen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31T0T92O37X2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJ8DFGC#wasThisHelpful","R31T0T92O37X2D","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A good toy for those who like to create things,KNEX K-Force K-10X Building Set is your kids very own mini dart gun. Put the pieces together, aim, and fire the lightweight darts for some safe and entertaining fun.I have seen other guns made for firing darts, of course, but part of what sets apart the KNEX K-Force K-10X Building Set from the others is that kids have to put the machinery together before they can start blasting. It isnt too difficult, but depending on a childs age, he/she might need some assistance. If possible, let junior attempt building it at first. It does require some skill and it makes for a good lesson in mechanics.Once everything is assembled, the KNEX K-Force K-10X Building Set is ready to use. The set comes with five darts and the device is capable of shooting them a long distance. According to the manufacturer, they can travel up to 75 feet. This is quite a bit and it means that kids can take them outside and have fun shooting at various targets. The darts are soft and pose no threat of injury, so parents need not worry.KNEX makes several different building sets like this one. I havent experienced the others, but I can say that the K-Nex K-Force K-10X Building Set is a very good choice for harmless and active play.

"Ive always liked the Dummies book series and have found most every one of them useful as a reference guide and instructional manual. Juicing and Smoothies for Dummies, once again, continues my confidence in the Dummies series. Its a complete guide to turning your favorite fruits, vegetables, etc., into delicious, drinkable concoctions.Juicing and Smoothies for Dummies is great as a recipe book and I would bet that many people who get this book go directly to the recipe section and start juicing away. I like the different cross references for the recipes and the numbered, step by step instructions are perfect for those who want to get things right the first time. Each recipe ends with a nutritional breakdown and some of the recipes even have added tips, helping you get the most from your efforts.So, Juicing and Smoothies for Dummies has lots of great recipes but like other Dummies books, this one is much more than a one- dimensional source. The book talks about the health benefits of juicing; offers advice for finding the best juicer or blender; describes the proper technique for juicing; and even offers advice for recycling juicing leftovers. I thought I was already well versed on smoothies and health science, but I still found new things to learn in Juicing and Smoothies for Dummies. There is very useful advice throughout this book and most everyone who reads will discover something new.Fresh juices made from fruits and vegetables represent a great way to improve health and get the balanced nutrition we all need for good health. Juicing and Smoothies for Dummies is an excellent guide for this purpose and I like to keep it nearby for quick reference. It encourages fresh juicing and blending of fruits and veggies for improved health and with its endless tips and advice, its sure to improve your juicing expertise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PB5V1T2J5713/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119057221#wasThisHelpful","R2PB5V1T2J5713","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At-A-Glance Planner is a handy way to keep track of special days and appointments. Great for those who have busy schedules, it covers a thirteen month range and has decent size pages to fit everything you need into a designated place during the week.In my household, we have gone the way of electronic for most things, and that includes planners. We utilize an online calendar for our tracking and planning and for the most part, it works for us. But there is still something to be said about a book- style planner. Yes, its a little old fashioned but its nice to just grab a book when you want to consult what is planned rather than have to open up your laptop or ipad. At-A-Glance fulfills that need and my wife has already begun using it to schedule her work- from- home events.I like most of what this planner offers and I like that it is medium in size for easy transport. The larger planners, with standard 8.5 by 11 inch sheets, are too bulky. I also like that it has large spaces to include daily activities and appointments and the contacts info sheets are nice. Oh, and the holidays page is good because it reminds you of all the important days on the calendar for three years running.If I had to find some sort of faults with this planner, there would be two things. One is the days of the week- they are lined for better organization, but there are no pre- printed time blocks showing the actual times of day for you to fill in like you get with, say, a Franklin Covey planner. The other thing I dont prefer is the orange type on some of the pages. Black or blue would have been better, for greater contrast.Overall, however, I still find the At-A- Glance planner a good one for a persons individual organization and appointment scheduling. Yes, a paper planner is a bit old fashioned in todays tech age, but sometimes old fashioned is good and this is certainly true with a planner. Try it for yourself and get your own life in order.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18S4Z1ABJYAZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCC6CAI#wasThisHelpful","R18S4Z1ABJYAZA","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do your kids love anything Disney? My girls are Disney fanatics and anything with popular Disney characters on the package makes it an instant hit with them. Naturally, they like the Paper Mate Mates Mechanical Pencil Disney and they were happy when the package arrived in the mail. They opened it quickly, divided the pencils between the two of them, and proceeded to write.The Disney characters on these mechanical pencils add a degree of cuteness and likeability, but what about the actual quality of the pencils themselves? My girls told me they were good but knowing their bias, I had to find out for myself. And I have to agree with the kiddos- these are good mechanical pencils and are better than most. The first quality I like is the triangular body of the pencils. This is not only more comfortable between the fingers, its also nice because it prevents rolling. Round pencils tend to roll off of a table or whatever surface they are placed. These dont roll so easily, and that keeps them from falling on the floor.This set of pencils comes with a pack of replacement pencil leads and speaking of the lead, it is a little thicker than others. The added thickness means the leads are less likely to break and that means the refill package should last for a while. I like the two spare erasers also because, again, you are given what you need to make the pencils last longer than expected, without needing to make a special trip to the store for replacements/refills.Mechanical pencils have their advantages. Add to the advantages the likeness of popular Disney characters and quality construction and you have the makings of a very good pencil. Give a pack to your kids- they will be grateful for your kind gesture and will get writing right away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IBIS1NS44P0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHJDW8G#wasThisHelpful","R1IBIS1NS44P0E","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jewelry is one of the few items that is accepted by most any woman, so when I had the chance to get this sterling silver diamond accent necklace, I gladly accepted. All I had to go by was a picture on a screen and a fact list, but I was pretty sure the wife would like it so I ordered and waited for it arrive in the mail.As I expected, my wife loved this necklace and while she does own several others, this one does have qualities that set it apart. It has an attractive, shiny appearance and the double heart design is very nice. But I think what my wife liked best is the way the chain is attached. The manufacturer made it so that the chain is on the back, not looped through the middle of the pendant. That means the front of the necklace is always facing out, like it should be. You dont have to keep flipping it around, like you do with other necklaces.This necklace is on the short side and that means that, for most all women, it will position itself higher up on the neck, making it just right as an accessory for certain clothing. I dont claim to know exactly what it will go with and what it will not- I leave that up to the lady in my life, who has the whole jewelry thing and accessorizing process down pat.I like the sturdiness of this piece of jewelry and it does seem like it was made to last. And the price is more than fair for what you get. All things considered, I cant really find anything wrong with this necklace and my wife loves it, too. For the money, its going to be tough to beat and it gets a five star rating from me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35PMPAQIP6T3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GGENP7E#wasThisHelpful","R35PMPAQIP6T3D","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Computer screens, television screens, cell phone screens- they can all get dirty and they must be cleaned with care. A product specially made for the task is essential and Rogge Duo- Clean Screen Cleaner is a very useful cleaner for the job.I have to admit, I was a little hesitant to use this cleaner when I first received it. The reason is because I have heard of various cleaning agents that claimed they were made for these types of surfaces, but in fact were not, and ended up damaging or blurring the screen. When I received this product, I started by testing just a small section of my laptop screen. Once I determined it was safe, I went ahead and cleaned the entire surface.The results I experienced with this cleaner were remarkable. The screen looks shiny and is completely streak free. It looks just like it did when my laptop was brand new. I was quite impressed and proceeded to use it to clean my television screen. It was just as effective on that surface as well and it had me wondering why I hadnt tried a product like this much sooner!Using this product isnt quite as simple as spraying your screen and wiping. In fact, youre not supposed to spray your screens directly. You should instead spray the included cloth, wipe it across the screen, then turn the cloth over and buff. This will remove all of the liquid and leave a clean, bright, streak- free surface behind. Spraying directly and wiping would be a little more convenient, but its still pretty easy the way it is and it takes little time to finish.Electronics are part of most every household. They need regular maintenance and care and Rogge Duo Clean is a great product to get your computer, cell phone, television screen, etc., looking as clean as new. I am very satisfied with this product and definitely recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PCX1GWEG2DZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0029ZDRSQ#wasThisHelpful","R3PCX1GWEG2DZS","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gourmet dog foods usually offer superior nutrition. Nutro Farms Harvest Small Breed Adult Chicken and Whole Brown Rice is exactly that- a gourmet food with a gourmet price and superior nutrition to match.My dog is on the small side and doesnt eat much, but we try to feed him only the best food and this dog food from Nutro easily meets expectations. Chicken is the main ingredient and the food contains a high dose of protein and other nutrients. The food even has fruits and vegetables for a more well- rounded nutrition- rich diet.This dog food has smaller kibbles and my 22 pound dog had no problem chewing them up. He has eaten other Nutro dog food products but like with other gourmet foods, he approached this food with caution. His interest was only lukewarm at first, but once he started to eat, he quickly finished his bowl. I was glad to see this, as I have had issues with certain other gourmet foods, some of which my dog would not eat at all unless I poured gravy or some other enticer on top of the food.Is there any drawback to Nutro Farms Harvest Small Breed Adult Chicken and Whole Brown Rice? I can think of only one, the obvious one, and that is the price. The small bag costs more than four dollars per pound, which is quite steep, even for a gourmet food. I recommend buying the larger bag so you can get a better per- unit cost. But even then, the price is high and some dog owners might not purchase the food for that reason alone.Good nutrition and superior ingredients are important to concerned dog owners everywhere. Nutro Farms Harvest Small Breed Adult Chicken and Whole Brown Rice is an excellent food for a dogs good health and as long as you can get past the high cost, you will find that this food fulfills most all of your demands in a quality dog food.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6LLECG0QO87N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T62YKOK#wasThisHelpful","R6LLECG0QO87N","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When was the last time you changed your shower curtain? We have two showers in our house, one with a glass door and the other with a curtain. It has been years since we changed the curtain, so when presented with this opportunity, I went ahead and grabbed it.With its pink colors, my girls- the primary users of the bathroom with the shower curtain- liked what they saw. I agree that the colors are pleasant and since my girls bathroom is neutral in color anyway, it was very easy to place this curtain and matching mat in the bathroom without anything looking weird.  The more feminine colors make it good choice for a girls bathroom so in this respect, the curtain/rug combo earns some points.However, this set from Oceanique loses points in other ways and one of them is with the shower hooks. They do not slide very well along the shower rod, due to their metal construction sliding against the metal rod. They seem cheap, too, and are not completely closed, rounded hooks. That makes it easy to remove the curtain and the hooks because they lift right off without little effort. But its bad because it means the hooks can pop off as you try to move the curtain back and forth. Rounded hooks take more effort to attach and remove, but they are more secure.Looking at the quality of the material used for the shower curtain and the mat, well, they seem okay but not anything great. When I think about the going price for this set, it does seem a little high for what you get and I notice that other reviewers have made similar observations. I do like that the mat stays in place on the floor and doesnt slide around but it seems a little too thin. And I also wish the set came with a liner. You have to supply this yourself, which seems unfair when you consider the price. The manufacturer should have included this.Shower curtains need occasional upgrades and the Oceanique shower curtain/bathroom mat set seems like an acceptable option. I know there are better curtains on the market and I still think the set is overpriced. But it does have enough going for it- including the fact that my girls like it- to make it worth a look.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24Q36KQTMA9B8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGVAGQU#wasThisHelpful","R24Q36KQTMA9B8","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A mattress topper can go very far in adding comfort to your sleep. Classic Brands Defend-A-Bed Mattress Topper is just the ticket I needed to more comfortable nighttime rest. Its special padding adds softness and its leak proof, to keep your mattress in top condition.Mattress toppers are essential for a better nights sleep but a flat, simple pad wont do the trick. These less expensive mattress pads might be cheaper, but they add nothing in the comfort area. Classic Brands does add a good deal of padding and you can feel the difference it makes, right out of the bag. The quilting fiber filling and bamboo cushions your mattress, making sleeping more comfy than before.This mattress topper can accommodate mattresses up to 22 inches in thickness, so it will work on most of the mattress out there. One thing to note- and that many others have stated- is that the sides of the padding are rather thin and seem a little flimsy. Nothing has happened to mine yet. It is still held firmly in place and the elastic edges havent come undone. But these sides do seem weak, like they may not last very long. The verdict is out on this, but considering the other positive qualities, Im going to predict that the sides hold up for the duration.With its waterproof feature and five year warranty, Classic Brands Defend-A-Bed Mattress Topper has two additional reasons to consider it for your bed. But the main reason to purchase this mattress pad is comfort, and it easily scores high marks in this area. In fact, I would say that it ranks as the best mattress pad/topper I have owned thus far and I cant wait to try out others in the Classic Brands lineup. Its an excellent mattress cover and all but guaranteed to improve your sleep.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG8Y67AKH5KEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5LSHLI#wasThisHelpful","RG8Y67AKH5KEW","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zumba Fitness Incredible Results is a fitness system ready to be employed in your living room. It comes complete with several workout disks and a Zumba Rizer, needed for some of the workouts.I usually limit my workouts to walking/jogging and for purposes of maintaining my size/weight, this seems sufficient. But sometimes, an outdoor walk around the neighborhood isnt practical due to rain, cold or hot temps, and other factors. This is where the Zumba Fitness system can help. It provides a ready- made cardio workout that increases your heart rate and produces the results you want from the comfort of home. Just view the images on your television screen, follow the moves, and watch as your personal fitness improves.The workouts presented in this Zumba routine are simple enough that most anyone can follow. The Zumba method involves alternating intense workouts with less intensity, back and forth, so that most anyone can take part and improve fitness. The different disks included in the set feature different routines, too, so you can select the one you like best to start. I find the Express routine is best because, with limited free time on my hands, it is the quickest one in the set. Most anyone can spare 20 minutes of time, so for someone like me, it fits in well with my schedule.Zumba Fitness Incredible Results is based on dance and those with a knack for dancing will enjoy it best and will take to it most quickly. However, dont worry if your dance moves arent smooth. Just try to follow along the best you can. You will still see and feel results regardless. Besides, no one is watching when youre in the privacy of your own living room, so bust out those moves and get in shape!Zumbas fitness routine is a useful one and Im glad I decided to give it a try. Aerobic fitness is something we all need more of every day and this exercise system will help you achieve the fitness goals you desire. Its a very good system overall and easily worth the investment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T0ZFNI38K9SU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEMPDI0#wasThisHelpful","R2T0ZFNI38K9SU","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hills dog food is a recommended brand. Vets recommended it, as do many so- called experts on canine nutrition. Most every dog food that carries the Hill's name is above average in quality and Hill's Ideal Balance Crafted dog foods continue the trend.I try to feed my dog better food and, unless I'm in a bind and need dog food in a hurry, I refuse to purchase most grocery store brands. The reason is because of the ingredients. I just cant see serving my dog something with so little nutritional value and so many ingredients that are absolutely useless to a dog's body. Most of what is sold in stores just doesn't measure up, but this dog food easily makes the grade. Meat and vegetables are the main ingredients and there is no soy, wheat, or corn. This is exactly what I want and expect in a premium brand.As for the taste, my dog liked this dog food better than I expected. He has been known to shun these super- premium brands, but he liked this one very much. I was happy about this because, well, the price of this dog food is a little outrageous. The small size bag is priced very close to four dollars per pound, making it one of the costliest dog foods on the market. I agree that it's a very good dog food, but that price is difficult to swallow.If you can get past the sticker shock, you will find that Hill's Ideal Balance Crafted dog foods are worthy for your pet. The dry food doesn't smell bad and the nutrition is top notch. Try not to think about the excessive cash you are spending and focus instead on the great care you are showing your pet and you should be okay.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E9JOWVI55S9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TH3MMKW#wasThisHelpful","R3E9JOWVI55S9L","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Melissa & Doug make many great toys and childrens crafts, many of which are made with higher quality materials yet still sold at a reasonable price. Melissa & Doug Press a Pendant Necklaces are yet another good craft from Melissa & Doug and one that will keep the young girl in your home happy until time for the next craft.Girls love to make jewelry and other girlie things and this item is definitely made with the girlie girl in mind. The included stickers help to personalize each necklace and girls will have fun assembling a necklace to their liking. There is enough material in the package to create 5 necklaces, making it perfect for your young one to try with her friends as part of a birthday party or gathering.This craft is recommended for kids age 8 to 12 and it does include small parts. Younger children will not be able to complete this on their own and will need help but children at least 8 years of age shouldnt have any trouble. My girls liked putting together a necklace to call their own and they enjoyed showing off their creative work. About the only issue is that a craft like this wont last very long. This is why I said earlier that it will keep the kiddos happy until time for the next craft- In a matter of minutes, your daughter and her friends will have a necklace assembled and ready to wear. There wont be anything left to do, so its not a good craft idea if you want something the kids can keep going back to, time and again.Melissa & Doug rarely fail to deliver the fun and the Press a Pendant Necklaces are another example of a good product from this toy manufacturer, Girls will love assembling their own necklace and once the five necklaces have been made, dont be surprised if your girls ask for another box. Its good, creative fun and most any elementary school age female child will like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB44ONG8VULMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PZYQN7A#wasThisHelpful","RB44ONG8VULMC","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Want a quick, easy to unpackage and eat treat that offers some decent nutritional value? Most snacks dont fit the bill, but one that does is Fiber One Streusel Bar Strawberry flavor.I like a quick snack and I like that these bars have more nutrition than others. They are made with real fruit, healthy whole grains, and a good dose of fiber. The added fiber is completely lacking in other snacks and does help set this snack food above others.As for the taste, well, these bars are decent although not quite the burst of natural flavor I was hoping for. The ingredients list concentrated strawberry puree and its nice that they use this real ingredient. But I wish there was more of this natural flavor and Im a little disappointed that the product contains artificial colors and other additives that contribute to the less-than-stellar flavor. The taste is, therefore, not much different than that of other strawberry flavored cereal bars and, while certainly not bad, it isnt as good as I had hoped.Still, when I compare the overall product to other, similar snack foods, I have to say that these are a notch better than most and the reason is the fiber and whole grains. Could these be made even better? Of course they could, but they easily measure up to or exceed other snack foods and they have enough good qualities to earn my recommendation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KSBCU4T61M73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRFKUYY#wasThisHelpful","R3KSBCU4T61M73","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A newer brand of dog food, Avoderm combines meat, veggies, and other ingredients for a formula that is healthy and balanced for dogs. This Avoderm variety, Small Breed Lamb, is formulated for smaller dogs and is loaded with natural ingredients and good nutrition.I have a smaller breed of dog that tends to like variety rather than routine. He likes most of the pricier, natural dog foods so this dog food seemed like a good option for him. I like that the formula is grain free and contains all sorts of extra ingredients you dont usually see in other dog foods. These ingredients have special benefits and based on the positive reviews I have read, Avoderm seems like a dog food on top of its game.Feeding this dog food to my pooch, I was happy to see him take to it so quickly. Sometimes, with natural dog foods, he takes time to warm up and there have even been instances where he wouldnt touch the food at all until I covered it with gravy. But he took to Avoderm right away and seemed very happy with his meal. I am ready to try some of the other Avoderm flavor varieties as a result. If my dog likes this one the way he does, then he is bound to like the rest.Avoderm is an American- made dog food and I like very much that the product comes with a satisfaction guarantee, no questions asked. This is great for those who are reluctant to purchase these high- end dog foods for fear that their dog wont take to the food and money will be wasted. But if your dog is anything like mine, he will thoroughly enjoy Avoderm Small Breed Lamb formula. Its made with healthy ingredients and is free from grain, for the best canine nutrition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30Y4Y6D85CKIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1DF4KM#wasThisHelpful","R30Y4Y6D85CKIL","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Melissa and Dougs Mess Free Glitter Headbands and Barrettes Set was just what they needed for some creative and practical fun.I have always had a good deal of confidence in Melissa and Doug products and this one did not disappoint. My girls opened the box and started to have fun immediately, taking the 2 headbands and starting to decorate. They got to the barrettes later, but they loved everything and I liked that they were having fun while, at the same time, creating something they need and often use anyway.I like that this product doesnt contain messy, sprinkled glitter and I like that it offers some creative fun. The downside?- there isnt enough here to keep kids occupied for long. The assembly of a head band or barrette with added accessories and decorations is so simple, some kids will be done within minutes. This is very different from other crafts, some of which keep the young ones occupied for an hour or longer.Still, my girls do like this headband and barrette set from Melissa and Doug and they both give it two thumbs up.

"Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner for dogs is a great way to get your dog fresh and clean, Thick and with a pleasant scent, this dog shampoo is easy to apply and rinses clean with minimal effort.My dog is older and has problems with itching. He will often start by scratching his skin and then turn to biting at it in order to relieve the irritation. For this reason, we try to use special dog shampoos that are formulated to help control itching and related skin problems. This dog care product does claim to help with skin problems, so it seemed worthy of trying.And how did it work? Well, my dog lied down peacefully after a bath with this shampoo and I havent noticed much scratching at all. He slept soundly on a blanket and did not show many signs of skin irritation. Im saying he didnt scratch at all, because he did, but not as intensely as usual.This shampoo/conditioner succeeded in making my dogs coat feel soft and smooth, like a conditioning shampoo should. Its probably unnecessary to use this every time you give your dog a bath, as most dogs do not need excess amounts of conditioner. But the occasional use is a good idea and this product does condition well.An itchy dog is an unhappy dog and Nourish Shampoo seems to have taken care of my dogs problems, at least to an extent. I wasnt expecting miracles- I only wanted my dog to get a degree of relief and that is what he got with Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner. The product therefore worked as promised and is one I recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U620Q63T9JAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJ45KXG#wasThisHelpful","R2U620Q63T9JAW","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yoga is gaining in popularity and as it grows, the need for yoga- related merchandise also grows. Besides special clothing, one item that can help make any yoga workout better is a good set of towels and Athletec Sports has just the answer to this need with its Ultra Absorbent Yoga towel set.First, I must say that I do not do yoga but the four females in my house do and they were very interested in this set of towels for their weekly yoga workouts. The towels are blue in color with one larger size towel and one smaller size towel. They feature a non- skid backing that helps keep the towel in place on your workout mat. This feature alone makes a towel set like this one worth owning. Regular towels do not have any such feature and they slide around when placed on most surfaces. With this towel, you can feel at ease, knowing it will stay in place.This yoga towel set feels soft and I was very surprised when I learned the towels were made from polyester. Technology has certainly changed for the better, because I can recall a day when anything made with this much polyester felt anything but soft. Yes, an all- cotton towel is softer but the softness level is still good when all things are considered. These towels feel good and they are absorbent enough to relieve the perspiration that naturally comes with a yoga workout. The larger size towel in this set is almost six feet in length so its large enough to fit the entire body of most people. At first, we wished it was a little larger, but after using it a few times, it seems fine.About the only potential strike against this towel set is its use of Ultra Fresh technology, which includes some less desirable ingredients that have not been thoroughly tested. Other than that, this is a good yoga towel set and useful for any type of workout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKGXAGWQV3TWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYJWYOK#wasThisHelpful","RKGXAGWQV3TWX","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Young students of geography and travel love a good map and one that is worth considering as an addition to your childs bedroom wall is T.S. Shure Pictorial Map of the World. This map is laminated for durability with rivets in the corners for easy mounting and re- mounting plus stickers for added fun.With this map, kids get a general idea about the world around us and its many wonders. The countries are not depicted in their precise shapes but they are close enough that it shouldnt matter. On each continent and within each country, the map highlights some of the landmarks and points of interest. This is fun for kids who like to find places they have already visited and attractions already seen as well as find new and interesting places worth visiting in the future. With the added stickers, children can identify places they have been, first flight taken, first ride on a ship, places they want to visit, etc.This map is a good deal of fun for kids and I like anything that helps improve knowledge of geography, since this is an area where people are sorely lacking. But I must deduct one star from my rating due to some of the inaccuracies. Im not talking about the shapes of the countries I described above- this doesnt bother me too much because I realize it was intended more as a cartoon and not meant to be precise. But the placement of some countries and boundaries are inaccurate and not becoming of what should be an educational tool. One good example that I noticed right away is Cuba- the map shows Cuba as situated north of the Tropic of Cancer. It is, of course, south of the Tropic of Cancer and it should be shown this way on the map, but it isnt.So, the placement of certain things is a little off, but the rest of the map? I found it nice and my kids loved checking out the countries of the world and marking where they have already been and would like to visit. The map would be worthy of five stars were it not for the oversight described in the last paragraph, but it still has enough going for it to recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HZY9HL5KS0H6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLFWEDS#wasThisHelpful","R3HZY9HL5KS0H6","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In todays digital age, recording devices can be very useful. You never know when you might need to record a conversation, presentation, or the like and while many cell phones are made with built in recorders, there are special devices made for the job and one of them is this 8 GB voice recorder from iGearPro.As a blogger, having a small recording device is something very handy and this device is certainly small. Its dimensions measure only about three inches in length and about one and a half inches in width. Its small size is nice because it will fit in the most compact spaces. I can place it in my shirt pocket and it is entirely hidden from view. A recording device is a simple device and there is no need for a large size so making it small was the right thing to do.For recording, all you do with this device is press the button with the red dot, located on the front. The stop and play buttons are also right on the front with volume, mode, on/off, and other buttons on the side. I like that the manufacturer included labels for the side buttons. Just look at the back and you will see the labels. This is good because it clarifies what each button is for so you dont have to guess.I found the sound quality good with this device and I appreciate the included attachments and cables. But all is not perfect with this device, as it does contain a few notable flaws. One is the lag time when pressing the buttons. Once the stop button is pushed, it takes a few seconds of holding before it stops. Another issue I have is with the volume controls. They make a clicking sound when you push them and the clicking noises transfer through to your recording. I can easily tell when I hit the playback if someone pressed the volume button because you can hear the clicks.Still, I am satisfied overall with this device. It has plenty of space and that means you can transfer music and use the MP3 features without worry. The sound is clear and the included phone cable is perfect for those times when Im conducting an interview via telephone and want to make sure I capture every word. Its a good device for the money and one I recommend to all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28H9CKR39K4PP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9SI8IE#wasThisHelpful","R28H9CKR39K4PP","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"T.S. Shure Pictorial Map of the USA is a nice way to teach kids about the geography of the United States and some of the important landmarks and natural attractions common to different states. The map is in poster form for quick wall mounting with a laminated finish, making it easy to place and remove stickers.We spend a good deal of time traveling and with family living in other places, away from our home, we often talk about going places and seeing things, new and familiar. This colorful map is good for teaching kids where places are and the included stickers make it fun to mark where family live, where you would like to visit, and where you have been and would like to return. My girls liked placing the stickers on the poster and talking about attractions they would like to see in the future. The map helps give them a sense of where they are in relation to other places they know, helping them learn about distance, location, and more.This poster comes rolled up but thanks to the lamination and the grommets in the corners, it is easy to attach to a wall with no worries about tearing- a common concern with paper posters. The stickers number 62 in total and will keep kids occupied for some time. One of the few issues I have with the stickers, however, is that they do not contrast very well with the colorful and noisy background, and this means it takes more effort than it should to see them on the map. It would have been better if the stickers were colored/marked in such a way that they stand out on the surface of the poster. It would also be better if the states shapes reflected their actual shape. They are not depicted on the map in their actual shape, and this does bother the geographic purist in me.Still, all things considered, I like this poster for many reasons. The images make it fun and the colorful background and stickers make it appealing for kids. Considering the lack of geographic knowledge in todays society, anything that can give kids a leg up on others is welcome and T.S. Shure Pictorial Map of the USA does exactly that, teaching kids about American geography in a fun and educational way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EC27DGDRQ981/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLFWDFM#wasThisHelpful","R1EC27DGDRQ981","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bolse UBS Car Charger provides the power you need to keep your electronics going strong. With three ports, you can charge three separate electronics all at once, for the most efficient in- car charging possible.I use my smart phone and its camera for blogging and other purposes and a charged cell is a must for me. I can't arrive somewhere and discover I no longer have a charge on my phone. The phone has to be ready to go and this is why a good car charger is a must. This little device from Bolse is one of the most compact I have ever used and it gets the job done in a reasonable time. It's small enough to fit into your shirt pocket and when plugged into the cigarette lighter, you don't even know its there. From a physical standpoint, Bolse kept things simple and I'm glad they did.The best quality of this charger is the fact that it can charge three things at once. It doesn't come with its own cords or cord extensions, so you have to remember to bring those along in order to use the device. As long as you have the cords, this little charger is ready to help you. And there is no fighting with the wife and kids over who gets to charge their electronics first. There are three individual ports, so three items can charge at once.I use this charger for my smart phone and upon close examination, this charger is capable of charging my phone at the rate of about 9 percent every 10 minutes. This isn't lightning fast, but it's fast enough for my needs. I don't need 100 percent charge to pull out my cell phone, snap pictures, and share on social media. I only need to make sure my charge is at least in the 30 to 50 percent range and given the rate that this charger supplies the juice, I will almost certainly have the power I need by the time I arrive at my destination.This Bolse car charger might be made better with different size ports but for all I know, Bolse probably has a charger for that purpose. A little speedier charging would also help but this is still a very good charger for the price and it has proven itself very useful, supplying just the power I need when I need it most.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R353DNZXLWH4KB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLIBGW6#wasThisHelpful","R353DNZXLWH4KB","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mopping is an essential household chore and the right mop can make a noticeable difference in time and effort expended to get the job done. Ordinary sponge mops are fine for minor cleaning, but for the tougher stains, a better mop is a must and the Dirt Devil PD20100 2 I 1 Versa Steam Mop is a good tool for the task.This steam mop is lightweight and is easy to use. You just pour in the water and wait for it to heat up and produce steam. In less than a minute, the mop is ready to use. The steam action produces a good deal of heat, loosening up dirt and stains and making cleaning easy. The area where our dog lies on the floor is often the dirtiest in our house but this steam cleaner eliminates the messes with ease.Among the physical qualities I like best about this mop are the lightweight design and the triangular- shaped head. The mop is very light and versatile and its lightness almost makes it seem inadequate when you first use it. You start to doubt whether or not something this light can clean effectively, but your doubts fade away quickly once you plug it in and take it for a household spin. And the triangle shaped, swivel head is perfect for reaching corners- it glides into the far reaches of a room with ease. When you are finished, the scrubbing pad removes for simple machine washing.This Dirt Devil steamer can be used to clean carpets as well as tile and other surfaces and it comes with an attachment for cleaning items above the ground level. I have used it only on tile floors so I cannot comment on the effectiveness on carpet. But I like what I see with its ability to clean tile. The cleaning power of steam makes all the difference and since it fuels itself with water, there are no harsh chemicals. A few more attachments would be nice, but this is still a very good tool for the money and it does make cleaning the floor easier than before.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19YZSWP4UX4GY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4MHJLO#wasThisHelpful","R19YZSWP4UX4GY","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Koss SP540 Full Size Dynamic Headphones are a good set of headphones for most needs. Conforming to the shape of the ear for added comfort, these headphones deliver about as expected for the price.Comfort and sound quality are the two most important things I look for in a good set of headphones and this set earns a good grade on both counts. The D- shaped ear pieces fit the shape of your ears and feels good to wear. This is much better than the round- shaped ear pieces common with cheaper headphones. The sound is good, too, and it got better with repeated use. The bass in particular is very good with these headphones. My kids actually appreciate the sound more than me, as evidenced by their quickly snatching them from my desk and using them on their ipads and kindles.As I said, for the price, these headphones are good and they reproduce sound quite well. I like that they can be turned to store them flat and they have an attractive appearance. The one issue I have with these headphones is the vinyl pads on the ear pieces. One of them popped off and I had a heck of a time getting it reattached. They do not snap back into place- you have to take the thin edge of the vinyl and push it back in place, in a small crease. There isnt much give, so you have to stretch it and you need to hold one side while you attach the other- similar to the process of attaching bike tire to a rim. I almost gave up at first, but I kept trying until I got it back into place.Koss does make some very good quality headphones and this set, while not excellent, is still very good and worthy of your money. Just try to be careful and avoid letting the padding come loose on the ear pieces and you should be fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20RTGZPI5YZTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVWTVGY#wasThisHelpful","R20RTGZPI5YZTC","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do your kids like to color? Mine love to and they will often preoccupy themselves for hours with nothing more than a simple canvas and a set of paints, crayons, or markers. With Alex Toys Color a House Childrens Kit, they have precisely that- a large canvas and six colored markers for hours of safe, enjoyable fun.My girls have had multiple houses like this one and they love the coloring part more than anything. Yes, once the house is assembled it does serve as a place of play but its really the coloring part that they like best. This particular house is about as good or better than others, with similar construction and only a few minor flaws.On the positive front, the kids love the cute design. The sides of the house feature flowers, lights, bugs, and other things, all depicted in a cutesy way. My girls love coloring with the markers and adding their own expressive twists and turns. I like that the toy comes complete with six large markers that include all of the primary and secondary colors- Red, blue, yellow, purple, orange, and green. The markers are big and contain enough ink to last for the duration and beyond. The colors are bright and attractive, too, and they add greatly to the enjoyment of the toy. Having to supply our own markers would have been a royal pain, but Alex Toys includes them so you dont have to worry.The one issue we had with this toy is assembly. It should be easy to put together, but we did have some challenges with the roof and the dormer window on the top. It would be nicer if the house was a little larger, too. But other than these issues, this is a nice toy that encourages creativity and keeps the kids busy and out of trouble for a long time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P7AT25UINWBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYW4ZM6#wasThisHelpful","R1P7AT25UINWBR","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not very picky when it comes to shampoo. My hair is short, is thinner than it once was, and doesn't need the level of care that others' hair requires. With the exception of the shampoos that have a drying effect on the hair and scalp, most others will work okay for me.Still, even though my needs are minimal, I try to change out my shampoos and use different varieties for the benefits they offer. Jack Black True Volume Thickening Shampoo has turned out to be a good choice for my hair. It's masculine scent, moderate thickness, and ability to add a small amount of shine and body to my hair make it just as good if not better than others.This shampoo doesn't have any conditioners, so it shouldn't be used if that is what you need. Rather, it's an everyday shampoo, good for all hair types and it contains specific ingredients to help make the hair and scalp healthier and make hair a little thicker. I haven't noticed much difference in the area of thickening, but then again, I don't have a lot of hair remaining to thicken, so I cannot validate this claim. But I like the way my hair feels after using this shampoo and it seems to do the trick without any drying or other negative effects.I will continue to use a variety of shampoos and Jack Black True Volume Shampoo is a product I will purchase again. I haven't noticed it at local stores, but I know it's available online and its ability to clean and protect the hair and scalp are more than sufficient to make it worthy of a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3048D1NGJZ7OI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WMWR1G#wasThisHelpful","R3048D1NGJZ7OI","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A microscope is a great learning tool and many among us have fond memories of using one in science class in junior high or high school. Pre- elementary school age children are often too young for a real microscope, but there is no reason not to get them started young, and that is where the Manhattan Toy Learning Play Microscope can help.What do you get with this play microscope? Well, you get a very sturdy toy with three lenses, three petri dishes, and three lenses for viewing fun. The make- believe petri dishes are fun because kids can look at patterns, bugs, and more, all of which change depending on the lens being used.The best feature of this toy microscope is its construction. It isnt made from cheap plastic or other material likely to break or wear out. Its actually made from wood and it is designed to last. The second best feature of the microscope is its educational value. Yes, its only make believe but it does stimulate imaginative play and it does get kids thinking more about science.Kids are exposed to science in grade school but there is no reason to wait until that time to open the mind of a child to this wondrous field of study. The Manhattan Toy Learning Play Microscope does the trick and while I would like it better if it had a few more accessories, it still has enough going for it- not to mention the sturdy wooden construction- to recommend it for the toddler in your home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OYC20GO91YAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2XNLYE#wasThisHelpful","R1OYC20GO91YAD","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disney has a huge amount of appeal to my two girls. They have loved Disney from the beginning and are still attracted to anything bearing the Disney name and images. This is why they took so quickly to the Disney Princess Ariel Hooded Bath/Beach Poncho Towel, It features Ariel, one of their all- time favorite Disney characters, and has cute colors that kids will love.This towel/poncho is designed to be worn over the head for use after a bath or after exiting a pool and it seems okay for these purposes. It is a little smaller than I expected, but younger elementary school- age children should be able to use it, even if it doesnt cover as much as they or their parents would prefer. So, for older kids, most of their legs will still be exposed, but most will love the towel/poncho so much, they will use it anyway.Probably my greatest issue with the Disney Princess Ariel Hooded Bath/Beach Poncho Towel is that it isnt very absorbent. Im used to the big, thick, fluffy towels we have in our household. They absorb lots of water and this Disney Poncho/Towel cannot compare. Still, it probably wont matter to Ariel fans, many of whom will fall in love with the towel immediately and wont care about or even notice its small flaws.My girls will likely be Disney fanatics for life and the Disney Princess Ariel Hooded Bath/Beach Poncho Towel is a towel they like and continue to use.

"My girls love anything Disney and they have been a fan of the Disney Princesses since the first time they opened their eyes. They love having a cute towel to use after bath or pool time and the Disney Princess Aurora Hooded Bath/Beach Poncho Towel is exactly that- a cute, colorful towel that can be worn over the head, featuring a Disney Princess.I knew there was no doubt my girls would like this towel at least in concept and I was proven right immediately. They loved the towel the moment they opened the package and couldnt wait to give it a try. They didnt want to wait to use the pool, so they decided to give the towel a try at bath time. I figured if it could encourage them to take a bath, then the towel would be worthwhile.After using this towel, their opinions are still intact, but mine a little less so. First, the towel is smaller than I expected. It seems like it was intended for younger girls, but ones a little older like my youngest, who is age 7, can still get away with using it. The towel wont cover much of their body, but it will be sufficient for most grade school age kids 8 and under provided they are not too big. Of course, I cant really hold this against the manufacturer. It was really my fault for not checking the size first, but it is something to keep in mind.As for the quality, it is very soft, 100 percent cotton and it seems made to last. It isnt as absorbent as other towels, however, so I found that I needed to have a regular towel ready to hand my young ones to soak up the excess water. The more I think about it, this towel might actually be better suited as a quick cover- up for use at the pool. The need for quick absorbency isnt as important when exiting the pool so I might relegate this towel/poncho to that use.My little ones love the Disney Princesses and other Disney characters and they do like these towels. I would like them better if they soaked up water a little more efficiently, but the kids love them regardless and if it encourages them to take a bath, then they are easily worth the cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFGLYQJY7CBVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6QQQD6#wasThisHelpful","RFGLYQJY7CBVE","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My girls like to help out in the kitchen. They like to create different foods and are fascinated at how everything is put together to create an amazing meal. They like kiddie- related food prep too so I got hold of the Cool Baker Magic Mixer Maker and introduced it to them one afternoon.Right out of the box, they seemed to love this little contraption. They liked that it is colored pink and they like that it looks just like an actual kitchen appliance. They got it ready, mixed up some cakes, and about 20 minutes later, served a bite to themselves and to me. They seemed to like the taste. I found it rather dull and unmemorable, but I had to remind myself that the mixer and the food it creates are made with kids in mind so if they like it, then that is what matters.As for the durability, it seems rather cheap and not likely to last. It was simple enough to use and my girls liked turning the crank and mixing up the batter. It did make somewhat of a mess, but not something that couldnt be cleaned up quickly. And I like that the cake didnt require baking. Just 15 to 20 minutes in the refrigerator was all it took to make the cake ready for sampling.Once the cake mixes were used, I was concerned that my kids would toss this aside, but they still use it from time to time as a regular toy. I almost prefer they didnt because I feel excess use is going to make it fall apart faster. But its nice to know that they still like using it without the cake.My kids like to make foods and they seem to like the Cool Baker Magic Mixer Maker. It does have a few issues as I describe above.

"SmartLab Toys Its Alive Slime Lab is just one of dozens and dozens of slime toys intended to fascinate the young scientist in your home. The way most of these labs works is similar: Combine the included slime mix, if any exists, with a few household items like baking soda, vinegar, cornstarch, etc., and let the fun begin.This slime toy works like the others in terms of the mixing, but it is also different than others, and I mean that in a good way. With this slime lab, the mixture is placed atop a motor that vibrates for greater effect. Kids can watch the colors and textures swirl around as the vibrations create some fun and very visual patterns. The instructions include 20 different recipes for slime and each can be made using items found in most kitchens.What I probably like best about this slime lab is the lack of mess! Okay, there is some mess but in relative terms, the messiness is kept under control very well. The key difference is that, with most other slime labs my kids have used, messiness is encouraged. These other labs involve sticking hands in the slime, spreading it with your hands, and so on. This is messy and gross, and if multiple kids are involved, they often end up smearing it on each other, splattering it on the floors and more. There is no problem like that with SmartLab. The slime, for the most part, stays in the bowl, out of your way.Educational toys are nice and SmartLab Toys Its Alive Slime Lab is a toy that does get kids thinking and asking questions. My girls like it and have returned to it more than once, creating more slime and learning about household chemicals and how they react. Its a good choice of toy that will keep kids entertained as they learn.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AXY3M9H3XHQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1GJ1Y2#wasThisHelpful","R2AXY3M9H3XHQF","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"George Foreman GR136B Classic Plate Grill is a small appliance good for cooking up a pair of burgers, chicken breasts, or other grilled item in a short span of time. The grill heats up quickly and cooks both sides of a food item thoroughly with little fuss.I have owned and used other George Foreman grills so I was already familiar with the concept when I obtained this one. The way it works is basically the same. You place the meat on the grill, close the lid, and let it go to work. Grease drips out of the front of the grill where it is caught in a pan, keeping more of the bad stuff away from your food and out of your body. This model works like the others, only on a smaller scale. And that could be an issue for some customers. There is very little space on this grill, making it useful for only one person or a couple that doesnt eat much. Its actually even smaller than I expected, so if you need space and want to grill enough meat to feed a large family, you dont want to buy this.However, if a small amount of grilling is all you need, then this George Foreman grill could suit you well. It heats up very quickly and cooks a pair of burgers in minutes without excess smoke or mess. There is only one setting- high- so you need to be careful and not leave it unattended. Most of the grease will fall and drip out the front, where it collects in the included tray. I found that cleanup of the grill was easy, too, but only if you take care of it right away. Allow it to sit for long and it will be more difficult to get clean. And you need to be careful how you clean because you should always avoid scratching the interior coating, which could make it no longer usable.For larger meal preparation, a larger George Foreman grill is a must.

With cell phones, iPads, and other electron devices so commonplace and so increasingly likely to run out of juice when out and about, a supplemental power source is often needed and that is what you get with the NOCO Xgrid Portable Solar Panel and USB kit.I use my android smartphone on a regular basis and I have had situations where I was outdoors at festivals and other events and my phone started to run low. I needed to take pictures and share on social media for my blog but had to limit my phone usage due to low power. I could have really used something that would supply the extra jolt of power I needed without an outlet, and NOCO Xgrid Portable Solar Panel is just that device. You open up the flaps, place it in direct sunlight, and get the power you need instantly.In concept, this device is a great idea and I have had a good deal of success with it. However, it does have a few shortcomings that most will quickly discover when they use this for the first time. For one, the panels work best if placed in direct sunlight and the stronger the light, the better. I tried placing it behind glass, on the dashboard of my car, but it  charged slowly. Partial sun will work, but strong, direct sunlight is best so if you live in a place with limited sunlight, this device may not work very well for you. Another issue I have had is with the detachable battery pack. It takes quite some time to charge it completely and it doesn't work well if only partially charged. The first time I used it, it had been plugged into the solar panels and placed in direct sun for about an hour. I plugged it into my phone but it wouldn't work at all. Only when the charge was more complete was I able to get it to work.Of course, you don't have to use the battery pack- you can just open the panels, aim at the sun, plug your phone or other electronic device directly into the panels, and charge on the spot. Because the panels are foldable, they are very compact and easy to take with you. I find that this direct charge method works best for me. Since I cannot always count on the battery pack working the way it should, I prefer to just use the panels directly. Of course, this is only possible when the sun is shining so one cannot ignore the battery pack completely. And you have to be very careful if you leave the panels outside to charge because they cannot be allowed to get wet. If you suspect any chance of rain, then you cannot leave them outside. If the panels get wet, the device is ruined.A backup power source is essential when you use electronics on a regular basis. There are many such devices available, but this is one of the few that is powered by the sun, making it ideal when outdoors and in need of an electrical source. It does have a few issues as I described above, but I still find it useful and will be sure to take it with me whenever a festival or other event beckons and I cannot afford to run out of power.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5OLCV4WJ726C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H36XXBM#wasThisHelpful","R5OLCV4WJ726C","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every kitchen needs a colander and the Oxo Good Grips Stainless Steel Colander is a very good one for general use. It can hold up to four quarts and drains away the water and other liquids for reasonably quick straining and food preparation.We have a couple of different colanders in our kitchen and I tend to reach for whichever one is available. With this Oxo colander added to the ranks, it has become, in most instances, our go- to colander for draining pasta and other foods. The stainless steel finish is much more attractive than that of other colanders and I like the legs because they grip well and prevent sliding. The colander can be cleaned in the dishwasher, too, but I prefer hand washing because, among other reasons, it helps maintain the shiny finish.If there are any issues with this colander, the only one that comes to mind is the small openings at the bottom. The holes on the sides of Oxo Good Grips Stainless Steel Colander are large enough to drain water quickly, but the holes on the bottom are not and you need to wait a little longer to make sure the water has drained completely. I discovered this when dumping pasta that I thought was drained back into the original pot. A small amount of water poured back with the pasta and quick examination shows the reason is due to the smaller holes in the bottom. They will work- you just have to give them a little more time than you may be accustomed.Colanders are a necessity for even the least talented cooks among us and the Oxo Good Grips Stainless Steel Colander is a very good device for the task at hand. It looks nice, stays in place, and gets the liquids away from foods in reasonable time for efficient food preparation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26M5LDC18IPCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DDVQ8#wasThisHelpful","R26M5LDC18IPCS","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steering wheels are usually rather plain in appearance and they can lose their luster and grip over time. This is where a steering wheel cover can help and the Bell Automotives Foose Wheelin Steering Wheel Cover is a good option for this purpose.My steering wheel is a few years old and is losing its grip so I figured a cover like this would be helpful. It takes time and effort to install the cover because it has to be stretched to reach around the edge of your steering wheel. There is just enough give and stretchiness to make it work, but it does take effort.This cover has a distinct chemical/petroleum scent that will bother some people. It gradually fades over time but it is very noticeable at first. In those early days, the strong scent will wear off on your hands and you will be able to smell it when you exit the vehicle. Again, it does wear off so you only need to exercise a small amount of patience.As for its usefulness, I find this steering wheel cover a good one. It has a stylish look and it adds a nice degree of gripping power when you drive. I live in a hot climate but I noticed right away that the surface of this cover doesnt get hot- even when my car is left sitting in direct sunlight. The gripping is what I like best, though. My original steering wheel was a little too narrow and was worn so it would sometimes slip when I grabbed it. That problem is gone with this steering wheel cover. I have much more confidence now as I drive.Steering wheel covers are not something most of us give much thought to, but a good steering wheel with sufficient gripping traction does make driving easier and safer. The Bell Automotives Foose Wheelin Steering Wheel Cover is a good cover for any steering wheel. Try to ignore the chemical- like scent when you first install it because it will fade away, leaving you with a stylish steering wheel cover that improves driving and performance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJVPGXU4CVVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MB0CSXY#wasThisHelpful","R3EJVPGXU4CVVK","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Certain office supplies/tools are essential in every household and one of them is scissors. A good pair of scissors is useful for so many things and Mead Academie Stainless Steel Scissors are sufficient for most household uses.What makes a good pair of scissors? Most will agree that cutting ability and comfort are both key and with these Mead scissors, the cutting and comfort are both sufficient. The blades are sharp enough to easily cut paper and cloth and my girls like using this pair of scissors for their crafts. Comfort is good, too, and they are designed so that both left and rand- handed individuals can use them. The space for the thumb could use a little larger opening, but otherwise the comfort is sufficient.These scissors are lighter in weight than others in our household and that makes them just right for the kiddos. We have other scissors than contain a lot more metal and weigh much more. Mead Academie Stainless Steel Scissors are lighter than that, but not so light to make them seem weak. I tested them on cutting a few different things and they worked fine. They are not heavy duty enough for the really difficult cutting jobs, but Im pretty sure Mead didnt intend them to be.With Mead Academis Stainless Steel Scissors, we have yet another pair of scissors to satisfy household needs. Scissors tend to get misplaced in our household, but these will likely remain in place at my kids craft table. They seem ideally suited for this purpose and they suit the kids needs well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28C0GVKWENGXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSEAU4Y#wasThisHelpful","R28C0GVKWENGXV","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dog loves dog treats as much as any other and he especially loves softer treats with just the right doggie- inducing scent. Natural Balance Hip and Joint Salmon Jerky Treats offer both qualities, with special ingredients to help dogs with joint issues.Starting with the basics, these dog treats are flattened, rectangular squares, brown in color, with a stench all their own. Its not a terrible scent, but it does get your attention and the attention of your dog. The treats are packaged in a re-sealable bag to keep them fresh and each treat contains glucosamine and chondroitin for joint health.Moving on to the treats themselves, I had no problem getting my dog to devour these treats. They met his criteria- soft and with an attractive scent- so he took to them immediately. He only weighs about 20 pounds so he was able to make this last for a small amount of time, but I think its safe to say that a larger breed will inhale these in seconds.These dog treats list salmon as the top ingredient, and thats good. But they also list sucrose as the third ingredient, which is a bit of a disappointment as I do not see why sugar is needed. There is a preservative or two as well, but the ingredients are better overall than what you get with other dog treats.Every dog deserves the occasional treat and Natural Balance Hip and Joint Salmon Jerky Treat seem like a very good treat to me. The price is rather high, but they do have good qualities and could be useful for larger dogs and others with hip and joint problems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6IP31100NQXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTCVWWY#wasThisHelpful","R6IP31100NQXC","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Young artists will like the Mead Academie Watercolor Paint Set. A better than basic set with 12 assorted colors and a small brush, this paint set is ready to go out of the box. Just grab a cup of water and some paper, and youre ready to go.This paint set looks pretty simple and in many ways, it is simple. But I find it better than others of its type for a couple of key reasons. The most important is the brush. Paint sets like this often come with a brush so this is nothing unusual but with other, similar paint sets the brush is often very cheap in quality and doesnt paint well or last long. The brush here is much better. I also like the assortment of colors because they include shades you dont see in other sets.The tray, with its assortment of colors, hinged lid, and included brush, reminds me of the paint sets we used as kids. The three sections on the lid can be used to mix colors and the paint is non- toxic and safe. Its small size makes it easily portable and there is enough paint to last many months with normal use. Sure, there are fancier, more deluxe paint sets out there but for the money, this set is going to be difficult to match. It has everything for the young artist in your home with few if any flaws.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EX3PVW2CXG24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSEAID2#wasThisHelpful","R2EX3PVW2CXG24","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rachel Ray Nutrish Soup Bone Dog Treats are a good treat for dogs with enough staying power and good taste to keep dogs occupied. The chicken scent and flavor is a hit with my dog and he likes chewing and enjoying these treats, making them a good distraction to keep him happy and quiet.Nutrish products are better than the average dog food with better ingredients and less of the artificial stuff that you dont want your dog to have. These treats are not perfect in this regard, as there are some less desirable ingredients on the label, but they are better than average and limited feeding should make them fine for most dogs.Moving to the flavor and other factors, my dog seems to like these very much and they do last a fair amount of time. Im not sure why, but my dog likes to gnaw on these treats a little at a time and that helps them last. I have noticed, from reading other reviews, that other dogs eat these treats much more quickly. I guess my dog is just different, or it could be the fact that he is smaller- only about 22 pounds- and older, 12 years old, and perhaps cant chomp away like he once could.Each package of Rachel Ray Nutrish Soup Bone Dog Treats contain only 3 bones and that means the price per bone is a little steep. If my dog gobbled these up in a couple of minutes, then Im not sure I would recommend them considering the price. But my dog makes them last and combined with his love of the treats and generally good ingredients, Im giving this product a recommendation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NSNE8D0Q4FFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WW861K#wasThisHelpful","R3NSNE8D0Q4FFT","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dandruff and dry scalp are sometimes an issue for me. I usually keep a separate bottle of anti- dandruff shampoo on hand for occasional use and Im always up for trying a new brand. This is what led me to consider CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair Anti- Dandruff Shampoo.I have never used anything from CLEAR before so I went into this experience with no previous brand- name bias. And I am happy to report that the results are positive. My hair feels soft and my scalp feels less dry than before. There is less itching and my hair looks good.This shampoo is thick and it has a scent that is menthol- like. When applied to the hair and scalp, it produces a cooling, tingling effect that is not unlike other shampoos with tea tree mint. Yes, its only a feeling, but it does make you feel like something special is happening to your hair and scalp. I like that the scent isnt overbearing and the same could be said of the cooling effect. Some of these tea tree mint/medicated shampoos are too intense. CLEAR seems to have everything in check.With its ability to control dandruff and make my hair look and feel great, CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair Anti- Dandruff Shampoo earns a high recommendation from me. I dont know how readily available this product is at my local stores, but its definitely a product I will look for and purchase again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU9XAFZBTABGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSNWZLY#wasThisHelpful","RU9XAFZBTABGQ","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A good toy for toddlers, the Fisher Price 3 in 1 Bounce, Ride and Stride Elephant helps youngsters develop while having fun. The toy lets then bounce, ride, and walk along as they listen to the sounds and enjoy the light up buttons and songs.This toy is intended for toddlers under the age of 3 and most will take to it right away. Those on the younger side will like bouncing more than anything while those toward the upper end of the recommended age range will like riding and pushing. My youngest child is outside of the recommended age range, but she is lightweight for her age and liked riding the most. It takes a little bit of effort, but with just a small amount of leg power, young children can push themselves along without any assistance.Kids will love the sounds and lights that are part of this toy. The good news for parents is that you can shut off the sounds- a feature you dont always get with similar toys. This is nice for adults who get impatient with the constant sounds coming from kids toys. In truth, the sound isnt that loud or that bad with this toy, but its nice to know that it can be shut off, if desired.A toy that encourages activity, keeps kids interested, and helps them develop has all the makings of a keeper and this toy is just that. The price could turn some people away, but its not too bad and the fun and other advantages make this toy worth the money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XJ7UBB46CG74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J49UTZO#wasThisHelpful","R1XJ7UBB46CG74","A3JPFWKS83R49V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JPFWKS83R49V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When even the author notes this is an issue, perhaps you should write an adventure that doesn't require a holocron.  For a rare item, 2 for 2 is way too much.

Fortunately, I don't like it.I think some of the Morality costs are way off.  So turning in a non-criminal for torture and execution is the same Morality cost as killing a murderer who is fleeing?

"Dreamhounds of Paris is an amazing idea for a campaign.  A Dreamlands game set in Paris using the Surrealist movement.  This is why I don't write role playing games - I never would have thought of this as an idea.The idea is that surrealists are changing the Dreamlands with their ideas, and your players go along for the ride.  In fact that's not fully correct, as the idea is that your players ARE the surrealists of the time.  It's another astounding idea, and I do like that Mr. Laws even says that he's ""bribing"" your players to play them by making them better then normal starting characters.This is the sort of book that screams out for full color throughout it, but we do get some color pictures in the middle, which are wonderful.I'm honestly not sure if I have the GM'ing chops to do this sort of game properly.

"If you already play EotE or AoR, you'll probably get this, so really not aimed at you.  Why wouldn't you want Consulars, Guardians, Sentinels, Warriors, Seekers and Mystics?So, new people.  Let's talk.Yes, there are 3 core rule books.  Star Wars Edge of The Empire RPG Core Rulebook, Star Wars Age of Rebellion Rpg: Core Rulebook and now Force and Destiny.  The starship left a long time ago on 3 core rulebooks.  Personally, I wanted all 3.  I even have 2 of the Beta books, but got one really cheap.  Edge of the Empire is more of scoundrel/bounty hunter type of game.  Edge of the Empire doesn't have to be where the game is, it's more the type of game.  Age of Rebellion - go fight the Empire.  Force and Destiny is much more of a Force game, as all of the characters are Force users.  EotE and AoR do have a Force user universal specialization, so they don't close out the Force as an option.  If you only want one core rule book, you need to think about the type of game you want to do very heavily.Next thing.  The funny looking dice.  The narrative dice system looks odd, but it really does work well.  Why should dice rolling be just failure or success?  What if you succeed at your locking picking of that office door, but the janitor notices on a Despair and decides to make a few credits with a blackmail attempt?  Or if you miss the stormtrooper, but distract him so well that your friendly Wookie gets an advantage on their try?  The more you play with the dice, the easier it gets.  One warning though.  Some very smart people have pointed out that with D20 and other game systems, it's easy for a player to ""hide"".  I agree that you can't do this with the narrative dice system.  It's much more of a cooperative system in which the players and GM interpret the dice.  This will take you in unexpected directions, but that is the fun!  You succeed with two Triumphs!  The Prince really likes you!  But you had a Despair.  The Princess doesn't!  Run with it!Beginner sets are great places to get dice, by the way.I do think that if you really want to use the Force in a heavy way, you need to get Force and Destiny.  The characters are not Jedi or Sith, but are generic enough (for the most part) that you can create them or a Force Witch, or whatever you want.I also appreciate the Force die.  There are more dark force sides, than light, but the light sides have more pips.  You also have the option to give in to the dark side for extra power.  But there can be a cost....There are quite a bit of races available in in the various books, as well as fan made supplements.  Also try the Order 66 podcast for really great information on the system - but I never listen, so what do I know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2956OOAQB80T5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633441229#wasThisHelpful","R2956OOAQB80T5","AN2WDDRGJTSML","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN2WDDRGJTSML?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the print book I've been waiting for, a guide to Firewall. Well, it's really more of the basics, than a guide. As decentralized as Firewall is, you really can have a cell doing whatever you want it to do. Heck, your players could be working for a rogue group doing it's own thing.The book does a great job of showing just how decentralized Firewall is, as different servers could easily be working against each other. Firewall also has plenty of different roles and factions, so it's possible that you could be deliberately working to stop another Firewall faction.It's also clear that some of the Firewall servers are most definitely not the good guys.

"I read the Instaread Summary and analysis of The Quartet as I was listening to the audio book of Joseph Ellis book.  The two work well together.The Instaread version summarizes the background and facts of this outstanding book (see my review in this website) and introduces the reader to the important characters and their relationships.  Perhaps its most useful segment is the Themes section that outlines the issues which impelled and retarded the transition from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution.I found this Instaread work to be very helpful in that it highlights the important aspects of The Quartet.  If you read it in advance it helps you know what to look for.  If you read the two simultaneously it reinforces themes.  As a post-read it helps remind you of what you read and may entice you to go back over pages that you may not have appreciated the first time around.  This Instaread is a valuable assist to the casual or serious reader of The Quartet.I did receive a free copy of this book to read and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36VISCJFP1VA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515193349#wasThisHelpful","R36VISCJFP1VA7","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Quartet is part biography, part history but mostly the tale of the Second American Revolution that replaced the loose confederation under the Articles of Confederation with the stronger government under the Constitution.The Constitutional convention did spring out of American earth as do trees and wild flowers.  Interstate squabbling readied the soil.  Shays Rebellion was the catalyst but cultivation required the work of far sighted statesmen who stroe to bring it to full fruit.  The Quartet are George Washington, the indispensable man who was coaxed out of retirement to again save the floundering country, James Madison who overcame his provincial constraints to promote a strong national government and forge the compromises that made it possible, Alexander Hamilton, the youthful native of the West Indies who could see the virtues of unity and John Jay whose international experience showed the place a united America could take in the world.Author Joseph Ellis draws the reader out of the present and into a nation in which loyalty was to a state and the foreign included the other 12.  This facet of the book brought to mind another book I have read and reviewed in this site, Moses Robinson and the Founding of Vermont by Robert A. Mello.  The Vermont story differed from that of the 13 states only in degree in that, not being admitted into the Union, it had more reason than others to toy with a British alliance as an alternative to the American one.  Comparing what Ellis says about the weak associations among the states with the Vermont situation as portrayed by Mr. Mello helps the reader understand the nature of political organization under the Articles.The articles themselves were designed to enable 13 colonies, while in the process of becoming states, to unite against a common British enemy.  They were much less suited for a growing, peaceful nation. The issues to be overcome in the transition to the Constitution were many.  The fear that a remote, national government would repeat the tyranny of the ministry in London, that a standing army could trample rights not enumerated until the adoption of the Bill of Rights, the tyranny of the large states over the small or the small over the large just to name a few.  What were the things that would unify these disparate states?  Ellis posits the public debt, western lands that could be the heritage of all states and people and a new external enemy, the Indians.I give high rankings to works that change my viewpoint on a part of history.  The Quartet meets that test.  At its end I had a much deeper understanding of the political milieu of the Articles and the process necessary to develop the Constitution under which we live.  The Constitutional Convention and the ratification process was a Second American Revolution because it transformed 13 loosely confederated sovereignties into a strong federal system. The process was not complete but continues to our day.  Ellis makes it clear that the founders did not envision that they were designing a governmental authority for the ages but one for their time that would give way as spring gives way to summer.  This book is a valuable addition to the early history of our land.I did receive a free copy of this book with the request, but not the obligation, to post a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39GX5M5MUH5D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055355073X#wasThisHelpful","R39GX5M5MUH5D4","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"War Of Two is a dual biography of Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr.  It follows their lives as they intertwine through New York and national politics.  Their backgrounds were different.  Hamilton, born in the Caribbean of questionable lineage, came to America with nothing but his own talents to propel him on his way.  Burr, the son of the President of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and grandson of Rev. Jonathon Edwards, was as close to American aristocracy as one could be without money.  Each found a place in the Continental Army, Hamilton on Washingtons staff and Burr in the conquest of Fort Ticonderoga and the attack on Quebec.In the law they both became prominent members of the New York Bar.  In politics Hamilton was the driving force behind that Federalist Party while Burr played both sides until declaring for Jeffersons Democratic Republicans.  When Hamilton guided the Constitutional Convention Burr managed to remain non-committal on the issue.  While serving as the first Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton adopted the British precedent of nationalizing the debt to create a bond to hold the country together.  As Hamilton manipulated President Adams cabinet from behind the curtains Burr was elected to the U. S. Senate and made a reputation as a politician on the rise.  Whereas Hamiltons one case of adultery became a scandal in which adultery was the most appealing explanation, Burrs habitual philandering had little or no impact on his career.The undoing of both men began with the1800 election.  The defeat of the Federalists deprived Hamilton of his access to power.  Scheming by Burr, the acknowledged vice-presidential candidate, to win the presidency, with Federalist support, in the House of Representatives after he and Jefferson tied in the Electoral College, made an enemy out of Jefferson and put the new vice-president on the road out of politics.  Dumped from Jeffersons ticket in 1804 Burrs attempt to revive his career by winning election as Governor of New York was foiled by Hamiltons efforts.  Perceived insults during the campaign drove Burr to request an interview at Weehawken, New Jersey.  Shockingly enough, this was the eleventh duel in which Hamilton participated, but only the second in which potentially fatal shots were fired.Their duel was fought between two men whose political influence was spent.  Hamiltons personality and Federalist decline and Burrs 1800 scheme eliminated them from the governmental stage.  From Hamilton it would take his life within hours. Burr it would condemn to decades of shame, reproach, and flight from the law and his own reputation.  Conspiracy with Gen. Wilkinson to detach the Western territories from the United States to create an empire for Burr to rule led only to failure and an unsuccessful prosecution for treason.  Debt, exile and ignominy were all that was left for Burr.Author John Sedgwick has masterfully woven two extraordinary lives into a spellbinding literary work.  I have read much about this era but learned new things from these pages.  It gave me a better understanding of two crucial figures in the early days of the Republic with glimpses of their interaction with other players, such as George Washington,  John Adams, George Clinton and Thomas Jefferson.  I emerged with a much greater understanding of their era.  That has made War Of Two a most worthwhile read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAREUECLEP30C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592408524#wasThisHelpful","RAREUECLEP30C","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Way Forward is part autobiography, part political manifesto and part vision of the future.  Now Speaker Paul Ryan begins with the story of his selection for the 2012 ticket, the campaign and the goals he and Mitt Romney hoped to achieve.  He then tells of his youth, his jobs, finding his father dead of a heart attack, getting into politics and his early career in the House of Representatives.  He then shifts into the problems he sees in terms of unsuccessful policies, failed leadership, and liberal courses that are doomed to failure from the beginning.  He contrasts his home town of Janesvilles response to adversity with that of Detroit.  Whereas Janesville lost its GM Plant without losing its soul, Detroit spiraled into disaster.  Ryan tells of his efforts to reach out to his constituents, Republicans and Democrats alike, as he seeks to represent them all.Ryan speaks of the challenge to Republicans to articulate how conservative policies can improve peoples lives and the gives some prescriptions as to what the GOP needs to do to become the governing party of the United States.  In the end his finds signs of hope throughout America, even in Detroit, the most tragic victim of liberal misdirection and mismanagement.From this book I got a sense of what drives Paul Ryan: his Catholic faith, the life he and his family have shared in Janesville and his core beliefs.  I understand why he was so reluctant to accept the speakership.  Besides the difficulties of leading a divided caucus the position runs counter to the path he has followed during his congressional career.  Early on Rep. Barney Frank told him that too many come to Congress as generalists and accomplish little.  He advised Ryan to concentrate on two or three things and get to know them.  Ryan specialized on the budget and feels that he can really make a difference in that area while the Speaker is, by definition, a generalist who may not be able to take advantage of the expertise he has developed.  Ryan is committed to making government work, not to create disruption.  I recommend The Way Forward to anyone looking for what motivates Paul Ryan and a path for our nations future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TWU6DCDE1QXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1478927763#wasThisHelpful","R2TWU6DCDE1QXQ","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is the second in the volume of the Nixon Tapes as edited by Douglas Brinkley and Luke A. Nichter.  Covering the period January to July 1973 it focuses heavily on Watergate, although with a few other topics, including a visit by Leonid Brezhnev.  At one point Nixon suggested sending an armored division to reduce the Indian protests at Wounded Knee.  How about that for the last battle of the Indian Wars?What I like about these books is that they take you right into the Oval Office.  This is not someones interpretation of what went on.  This is history in the makers' own words.  I was impressed with the amount of time the President and his advisors spent trying to figure out who knew what and who would say what.  Nixon kept comparing the situation to the Hiss case and tried to gauge what a U. S. Attorney could prove against members of his administration.  I am always surprised at how the conversation seems so matter of fact.  I am sure that some of the same attitudes are displayed, but not recorded, in many other offices and homes.  I started out thinking that I would just read a sampling to get a taste of the tapes but kept finding more and more that interested me.  I will return to it again and again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R7SPRBEYNUQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544610539#wasThisHelpful","R1R7SPRBEYNUQJ","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"World War II At Sea is an oversize book combining narrative, pictures and maps.  After beginning with a timeline and an assessment of the naval strengths of the World Powers in 1939 it goes through sections, usually 4-6 pages in length, dealing with notable naval events of the War.Author Jeremy Harwood has compiled a selection of World War II incidents from a variety of phases, theatres and belligerents.  Some are famous, like Dunkirk, Bismarck, Mers-el-Kabir and Pearl Harbor.  Others are things that, with all my reading, I had never heard of such as the mistaken sinking of Athenia, a British passenger vessel, by a German U-Boat two days into the war or Slapton Sands where German S-boats, similar to U. S. PT boats, attacked Allied vessels training for D-Day.  Some sections consider naval battles, like Midway and Coral Sea, while others explain sea-land operations, such as Torch, Husky and D-Day, with emphasis on the maritime segments of those battles.  American had submarines too and readers are introduced into their part in the strangling of Japan.This coffee table book has the perfect combination of pictures and narrative.  Your guests can lightly peruse it and be awed by the might, combat and wreckage.  The serious reader will find facts enough to hold interest and maps to illustrate details that are hard to grasp in other works.  Each section has fact sheets of the significant vessels involved.  I am glad that I read this book.  I will put it out at time throughout the year and will consult it when I am studying a particular action.  A book that serves all of these purposes merits a place in any World War II library.I did receive a free copy of this book to read and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RK8FEG2BKBZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0760347654#wasThisHelpful","R1RK8FEG2BKBZ0","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Letters from the Front is a collection of letters home from the Spanish American War to World War II.  They were written to Wisconsin but they could have been sent to anywhere USA.  They bring us the observations, worries, hopes and dreams of those who kept America free.  Some you may have heard of, like Billy Mitchell and Richard Bong, but most are men who, if they were lucky, went back to Wisconsin to live ordinary American lives. In their words we are introduced to the sights they saw, the hardships they endured, the battles they fought, their politics and their hopes for the future.Tourism existed in 1899 for Martin Stuhr who reached the Hawaiian Island and a Paradise it seemedwe made a tour of the Island and Visited an extinct Volcano known as Diamond Head.Amidst the carnage of 1918 Lee F. Pickett could appreciate nature My dear mother:Many song birds, chiefly sky larks, make the mornings beautiful with their songs.  Even on the front line while the whistling shells and bursting high explosives make everything hideous, these little birds keep on with their cheerful little songs.  Sometimes I wonder why it is that animals calling themselves civilized human beings dare to call themselves such and carry on such a war, while the little birds whom we class among the lower type of animals can spread so much cheer and gladness about on this earth.In 1944 J wrote of practicing darts in an English pub.  Surprising numbers of letters were addressed to teachers, such as Miss Trowbridge who heard from Stewart C. Yeo from New Guinea: wet clothes; no shelter; excessive rain and mud; dirty clothes; cold rations.  Several nights my jungle hammock only served to collect rain so by morning Id be sleeping in a couple inches of water.  When morning came I merely took my clothes off; squeezed the excess water pit and put them on for another day.  If I had been able to remove my shoes there was usually a quart of water in each of my small boots to be poured outwe had a picnic as compared to the infantry-they really got the dirty work.The letter writers preserved their views of their views of public figures and events of the day.  In a 1918 letter Lyle Phillips wrote: Here no one care much about politics though.  Roosevelt and Tafts answer to President Wilson caused a unanimous laugh at our mess the other night, but that was all.  Wilson surely is popular here with everybody.  According to Bene Smith a 1944 visit by Eleanor Roosevelt to a hospital in San Diego fell flat: they havent forgotten her crack she made about Marines after she toured the South Pacific last year she said that Marines whove seen S.P. duty and fighting shouldnt be allowed to come back her as they werent socially or morally fit to associate with American Citizens & should be left on island.  The death of President Roosevelt left Thurm  only able to say its better to have Truman enstead (sic) of Wallace while Miss Trowbridge heard that President Truman failed to impress me as being the eloquent statesman and leader.I was surprised to learn that POWs were able to send letters and request items.  Writing from Stalag Luft I in 1945, Paul asked My dearest if you send a food parcel to include plenty of chocolate and all things as condensed as possible-such as-Bisquick-Buckwheat-Pancake flour-jams-nut-fruit cake e.t.c. perhaps some dried fruits.All wars end and the warriors ponder their future.  In 1945 Don Gocker worried employers will holler no education and when he gets out of college ask How much experience have you had?  Apparently things worked out better for Don than he feared.These letters are gems, snippets of the threads that linked troops and home.  We are fortunate that Michael E. Stevens so skillfully selected and arranged these treasures and supplemented them with photos.  The Wisconsin Historical Society Press has made a great contribution to preserving our heritage in this book and This Wicked Rebellion by John Zimm and Michael Edmonds, which I also read and reviewed.

"I was looking for a fairly modern, comprehensive study of the battle for Germany so I picked up Armageddon.  Good choice!  Unlike many volumes it includes both the Eastern and Western fronts.  Beginning in September 1944 it covers Market Garden before shifting to the Vistula then taking the reader step by step to victory and the return home.  Author Max Hastings has provided us with an excellent overview of the closing events of the War in Europe.The great contribution of this book to World War II literature is its depth of analysis.  Hastings assesses battles, performance of armies and their leaders as well as the relative efforts on the Eastern vs. Western Fronts.  He tends to be critical of American, British and Canadian forces, both brass and GIs as compared to their German and Red Army counterparts.  Western caution after The Bulge is contrasted with Soviet aggression and ruthlessness.  Comparisons are often made to the conclusions of other historians who have evaluated the same topics.  Drawing heavily of quotations from many participants he pictures of the war as seen by those who fought it.  I took particular interest in quotes from later public figures such as Helmut Schmidt and Henry Kissinger.  While Armageddon does cover both fronts, I found it to be more heavily weighted toward the West, even while repeatedly reminding readers that most of the fighting was done in the East.This is an excellent book for the mature student of World War II in Europe.  It challenges the myths in which American, British and Canadian readers have been immersed while putting the contributions of the contending armies into perspective.  I recommend that we read other historians to get the fasts then turn to Armageddon for the reality check.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UR0ET2Z1UNCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375714227#wasThisHelpful","R2UR0ET2Z1UNCN","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Abandon Ship is the tragic story of the sinking of the Cruiser U.S.S. Indianapolis on July 29, 1945.  Tragic for its loss of life when peace was so near, for the precautions untaken, for the ordeal of sailors awaiting rescue and for the court martial that followed in its wake.The book begins with the background of Capt. Hashimoto and his I-24 Capt. McVay and his Indianapolis and some of their key crewmen.  It follows with a narrative of the sinking from both the American and Japanese perspectives.  The Indianapolis having slipped beneath the waves, attention turns to the hundreds of survivors adrift with their life preservers and bits of wood, vegetables and cans, their skin and eyes smarting from oil irritation, their hopes of rescue rising and falling with each wave.  Through four days of searing sun, fish and shark attacks, death and sinking hopes they floated before rescue arrived.Once the survivors were being given treatment the investigations began.  McVay was charged with two counts of negligence, for contributing to the sinking by failing to zig-zag, and for impeding the rescue by not causing a radio message to be sent.  Much of the book consists of summaries of testimony from many witnesses, including Hashimoto.  This section of the book makes for fascinating reading.  The author delves into the unique nature of the only World War II court martial of a captain for losing his ship and the possibility that others, or Navy procedures, may have been at fault for not initiating the search when Indianapolis did not appear as scheduled.  I will not spoil the mystery by mentioning the outcome of the court.Author Richard F. Newcomb has done an excellent job of assembling available information and weaving it into a narrative that is easy to follow and interesting to read.  Abandon Ship is a classic part of any study of the closing days of World War II.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z18WAP6MI63M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006018471X#wasThisHelpful","R2Z18WAP6MI63M","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lost In Shangri-La is the entrancing story of a joy ride gone bad and the seven week jungle ordeal of the three survivors and their rescuers.  On May 13, 1945 24 American servicemen and WACs set out on a sightseeing flight over Shangri-La, a beautiful and mysterious valley in the mountains of New Guinea.  Envelopment by swirling clouds with a rock in it led to a wreck that left only two men and a WAC as badly injured survivors.  Treating each others wounds and befriending natives enabled them to survive until a unit of Filipino medics and troops parachuted in to provide more advanced care while the survivors built up their strength for travel.  Then the question was how to get out of this inaccessible valley surrounded by Japanese to the south and natives to the north?  I do not want to spoil it for you so lets just say that it was an ingenious plan fraught with peril.While not an event that impacted the course of the war, Author Mitchell Zuckoff has crafted a tale of tragedy, adventure, heroism and relationships built across cultural boundaries thousands of years old.  There is even humor, particularly over misunderstandings between native and intruder. Lost In Shangri-La  is a good book to lose yourself in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QI28CVOMBZPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XXVSYW#wasThisHelpful","R3QI28CVOMBZPK","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Envoy is the story of Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenbergs struggle to save the Jews of Hungary in the closing days of World War II.  In 1944 and 1945 Hungary had the last sizeable population of Jews in occupied Europe.  Urgency to complete the final solution to the Jewish problem rose as the Allies closed in.  SS Col. Adolf Eichmann was determined to fulfill his duty to exterminate the hundreds of thousands of Hungarys Jews.  Working with the cooperation of Hungarian Fascists the S.S. engaged in a daily struggle with Wallenberg over how many Jews would be sent to the death camps and how many would be saved.Wallenberg was the most open and energetic of the Swedish and Swiss diplomats who intervened on the Hungarian Jews behalf.  His methods were to issue Swedish citizenship passes to Jews and then protect them in safe houses that were legal extensions of the Swedish and Swiss embassies.  As the Red Army approached, both the potential for liberation and the threat of accelerated persecution increased.  By the Soviet arrival an estimated 20,000-100,000 Jews had been saved by initiatives with which Wallenberg was involved.Salvation for his Jewish clients brought peril for Wallenberg.  Arrested by Soviet troops as a German spy, he disappeared into the Gulag from which he would never return.  His fate is shrouded in mystery with official records of his death in 1947 being disputed by later claims of sightings.  Author Alex Kershaw suggests that Russia must hold information that could shed light on Wallenbergs time in their custody.  Wallenberg became an international cause celebre in the 1980s when a Jew whom he had saved was elected to the House of Representatives from California.  Wallenberg was declared an honorary U. S. Citizen, a title he shares only with Winston S. Churchill.  With the surge of Reagan era attacks on Soviet human rights policies Wallenberg became a cause whose time had come.Alex Kershaw has written a series of World War histories that focus on the experiences of a few individuals (see my reviews of Avenue of Spies and The Liberator).  The ones I have read are excellent and this is no exception.  The contrasting personifications of the self-sacrificing Wallenberg and the all-consuming hatred of Eichmann carve the evil of the Holocaust into unmistakable relief.  Stalin is quoted as saying ""One death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic.  Kershaw has succeeded in transforming millions of deaths into tragedies.  He has done it with a wordsmiths craft that draws the reader into the action and never lets him out until the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNHVK54S6KXZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1436102863#wasThisHelpful","RNHVK54S6KXZK","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have long been a fan of the Old West and my interest in Legends And Lies was piqued by Instareads Summary and Analysis (see my review at: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XTIJYC0/ref=pdp_new_dp_review).As suggested by the Instaread Summary, this book is an entertaining introduction to the lives of fourteen personalities who added spice to the west from colonial times to the 20th Century.  Some were early pioneers, such as Daniel Boone who opened Kentucky before moving west to Missouri and Davy Crockett who fought Indians, served in Congress and died at the Alamo.  Kit Carson was an explorer who negotiated treaties with Indians.  Others were lawmen, at least part of the time, like Wild Bill Hickok and Bass Reeves, the dedicated Deputy U. S. Marshall who may have been the model for The Lone Ranger of radio and television.  The most colorful characters are usually the villains and this book is no exception.  The chapters on Black Bart, the Gentleman Bandit who lived a settled life between heists from Wells Fargo and left poems with each job, Jesse James, the Missouri bandit who robbed trains and banks throughout the central part of the country, Billy the Kid who killed and rustled through New Mexico and Butch Cassidy and Sundance who took their trade to Bolivia, fill in the facts behind the legends.  The West could never have won without the Cavalry and George Custer was not just the man who found disaster at the Little Big Horn but was a professional soldier whose story is as fascinating as any. Then there was Doc Holliday, the tubercular dentist who made gambled and drank his way into friendship with the Earps and immortality in the Gunfight at the OK Corral.  Eventually, of course, the Old West passed into history and it fell to the showmen, prominently Buffalo Bill Cody and Little Sure Shot, Annie Oakley, to bring its Indian battles and shooting exhibitions to fans everywhere.This book brings names and legends to life.  It presents them as real people who lived their lives in their places and times.  I was unfamiliar with Bass Reeves and was reassured to learn that Doc Holliday was, for his day, a competent dentist.  While the facts are interesting its greatest attraction is that Legends and Lies is just a good read.

"No Simple Victory is a critical examination of World War II in Europe by Norman Davies, an export on Polish and Eastern European involvement in that war.  It presents a much different perspective than that usually encountered by American, Canadian or British readers.  The points of the book are two-fold: first, that the bulk of the fighting occurred on the Eastern Front and secondly that the goodness of the Good War was soiled by reliance on the forces of a tyrannical Soviet Union to achieve victory.Davies challenges things we thought we knew, such as that D-Day was not among the largest battles of the War, American, British and Canadian efforts were helpful, but not essential to defeat Germany and that Nazis did not have a monopoly on atrocities.This book focuses heavily on the sordid record of the Soviet Union in its treatment of its own and conquered peoples, the depravity of Stalin and the naivet and whitewashing propaganda with which Western leaders treated Soviet behavior.  The hardship imposed by mass movements of people to conform to revised borders is given the attention that would be expected from a scholar of Polish history.I have read extensively on World War II but No Simple Victory forced me to view it from a different perspective.  I was aware that the bulk of the fighting was done on the Eastern Front but this made the proportionality more apparent.  It also brings the nature of Stalin and Soviet policy to the fore and aids in its understanding.  This is not a good starting point for World War II students but is an essential step toward an appreciation of the true nature of World War II in Europe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS4XR8KBEUZWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WOYDRK#wasThisHelpful","RS4XR8KBEUZWL","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"14-18: Understanding The Great War helps the reader understand the War through the understandings of those who fought it, lived through it and commemorated it.  Chapter by chapter the authors examine how civilized societies turned into brutal warriors, collectively and individually, and how they dealt with this transformation.The magnitude of the struggle was unprecedented.  The neat wars of the past between professional armies were replaced by total war as masses were inducted into the military and entire nations were channeled into support of the war effort.  Civilians who had never fought before found themselves hating enemies they did not know, picking off perfect strangers and cleaning trenches of the frightened and wounded.  What would they report about their service?  Although uniformed personnel suffered most of the casualties, civilians found themselves bombarded, expelled from their homes and forced to work for their countrys invaders.  How do they reconcile their loyalty to homeland with their acts of self-preservation?  How did the war affect the peoples faith and how did men of the cloth and their flocks pray to the same God for help in killing their fellow men?  How did individuals and nations assuage their grief and with what rituals did they conduct their mourning?Authors Stephane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker raise and try to answer these questions and more.  Originally written in French by French scholars it focuses on the French experience, but not the exclusion of other belligerents.  The writing flows so well that I would not have known that it was a translation had I not been told.  I did pick up a few facts of interest.  Australia was the only significant belligerent not to adopt conscription, most armies were dominated by peasants and War Memorials listing the dead and tombs of the unknown arose in the wake of the Great War.  At times I concluded that the American Civil War anticipated the course of the World War I and its aftermath.  A fairly balanced study of the Armenian Massacre is presented as the Turks sought to remove civilians potentially sympathetic to the Ottoman Empires Russian enemies.  At the end of this work I felt that I was aware of some currents flowing below the surface of battle and politics that so often dominate other tomes.  Understanding will take more reflection and more reading.  It is a good read early in the Centennial as it will help readers appreciate some of the thoughts they will encounter in future histories. For that it is worth picking up.I did receive a free copy of this book with the hope, but not the requirement, of a review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8QQF7HB43E87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0809046431#wasThisHelpful","R8QQF7HB43E87","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"World War II was not fought only on battlefields and the seas by soldiers and sailors, but also in factories by workers and managers. A City at War is the story of this home front told from the perspective of organized labor. Author Richard L. Pifer lays the background of Milwaukees historic industrialization and the state of its economy and workforce as well as the economic and political milieu in which it grew. Readers learn of Milwaukees transformation from a processor of food to a producer of steel and machinery. Pifer also explains the ongoing rivalry between the craft unions, concentrated in the A F of L and the industrial unions of the CIO. Resulting jurisdictional disputes would continue to contribute to labor unrest during the war. With its German and industrial heritage Milwaukee was unique among American cities in repeatedly election Socialist mayors.A City At War chronicles the role of organized labor in negotiating the agreements for overtime and work rules and organizing patriotic initiatives, such as war Bond Drives that enabled industry and labor to contribute to the war effort. I have read histories of industrys role in providing tools need by the military, but this is the first book I have seen viewing the history from labors perspective. One topic the labor historian must address is labors record of striking while Americas sons were fighting and dying, a practice some regard as disloyal. Pifer confronts the issue head on. He demonstrates that both management and labor maintained a perspective extending into an era of peace when struggles over profits, wages and work rules would determine the success of companies and the security of workers. Pifer makes the case that strikes were fewer and of shorter duration during the war than they were before and would be after. World War II is shown as a time during which inflation was rampant, even though partially suppressed by wage and price controls. Workers endured economic hardships while struggling to make ends meet and preserve their post-war prosperity. Although focusing on Milwaukee, its experience overlapped that of many other communities. I finished this tome with a deeper understanding of the role domestic labor relations played in contributing to victory. It is essential to an understanding of the home front in World War II.I did receive a free copy of this work for reading and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YSKM7RG4E29L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0870207296#wasThisHelpful","R1YSKM7RG4E29L","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The triumph of the American Revolution almost ended in a disaster of financial insolvency, military revolt and the death of a new nation just aborning.  Sword in Their Hands chronicles the roads to that lead to that crisis, the characters who spawned the Newburgh Conspiracy and the Father who saved his country once again.Author Dave Richards has done an excellent job of explaining the background to the events and the people involved.  The main problem stemmed from the weakness of a Continental Congress that assumed the obligation to prosecute a war without the ability to impose taxes and states unwilling to pay their assessment to the national government.  Army officers fought for years without pay or supplies while Congress and the states looked to each other to provide the means to continue.  With victory won they faced abonnement: uncompensated, impoverished, victims of the country whose independence they had just won.  With the Army headquartered at Newburgh, New York leaders called a meeting to prepare an ultimatum to Congress calling for payment of a pension or a lump sum to save its officer corps from poverty and disgrace.  Just in its moment of victory the Army threatened to march on Congress, stage a military coup and scuttle the American experiment with democracy.  As he had in the past and would in the future, George Washington rose to the occasion.  A surprising and unwelcome visitor, he implored his men to do nothing that would tarnish their place in the hearts of their countrymen.  Seeing they remained unconvinced, he produced a letter.  Unlike his earlier notes, this one was in small print.  He reached into his pocket and removed the glasses that they had never seen.  His acknowledgement of infirmity: Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray, but almost blind in the service of my county reconnected them with the chief they had followed, reminded them of all they had fought for and saved civilian control of the military.  Thereafter Washington would be an advocate for those who had heeded his call one last time.I have seen reviews that claim that this book is too long.  Perhaps so for those seeking History Lite, but not for me.  This book is an extremely well research study of a little known but crucial moment in the early life of our country.  The text is only 293 pages but a lot is packed into them.  By the time I finished it I felt I had a much greater familiarity with military leaders who had previously been little more than names, a better perspective on the course of the war and an enhanced understanding of political environment in which nation and states were feeling their way into the future.  I had recently read Moses Robinson and the Founding of Vermont by Robert A. Mello (see my Amazon review).  The times of the two works overlap, a time when Vermont asserted its independence while fending off claims from neighboring states and indecision from Congress.  As I read about Vermonts tale I wondered about the relative status of state and the national government.  Swords in Their Hands touched on the same topics and struggles.  At the end of this book I felt that I had a much better appreciation for the process that accompanied our nations early, uncertain growth.  For that Swords in Their Hands is worth every page and every word.I did receive a free copy of this book for reading and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R956B4GNGQOOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985387580#wasThisHelpful","R956B4GNGQOOI","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Gallipoli is a little known battle in a poorly understood war and yet it holds a fascination for historians and students of the Great War, for it was on these beaches that Australia is said to have earned its nationhood and against its rocks that Winston Churchills career almost floundered.Gallipoli, is a reprint of Alan Moreheads 1956 classic that brings order and perspective to its subject for the novice and World War I student alike.  The battle of Gallipoli was the 1915 Allied attack on the Dardanelles and Gallipoli peninsula of Turkey intended to seize Constantinople and force the Ottoman Empire from the war.  Often characterized as Churchills first adventure in the soft underbelly of Britains German dominated opponents, it is here shown as having a deeper purpose and greater potential than the sad disaster that is commonly depicted.  Aimed to draw Turkish troops from the Russian Caucasus front and open the Dardanelles to the export of Russian grain and the inflow of Western aid, it was the largest amphibious attack up to its time.The initial phase of the offensive was an attempt by old ships of the Royal Navy to force the Dardanelles.  When that failed the task was assigned to armies as the British landed at Suvla Bay and Cape Helles, the ANZACS, Australian New Zealand Army Corps, at what has since been known as Anzac Cove and French troops across the water at Kum Kale on the Asia side of the Continental divide.  Failure resulted from a combination of dogged defense, lapses in coordination and execution, lost opportunities and, even to the end, indecision as to the commitment to the project: how much, how long, whether to withdraw.  At the conclusion the shortcomings of the invasion were left behind as a flawless, virtually bloodless evacuation withdrew virtually the whole force with negligible casualties, except of course lo the unlucky few to be personally involved.I am very glad that I read this book.  I know relatively little about World War I and my familiarity with British military figures is sparse.  During some early chapters I felt that I was missing something while trying to follow the generals mentioned.  As I progressed and the campaign took shape I developed an appreciation for the battle not dependent on identities of individual actors.  At its end I had a much greater understanding of how the story played out.  I enjoyed the glimpses of humanity amidst death and destruction as the Australian and Turkish troops traded courtesies and gifts, reminiscent of the Christmas Truce on the Western Front a few months before.  I am left with a sense of loss, of lives spent for no gain, and all the what might have beens.  With more resources, which were available, perhaps the invasion would have reached its goals, the separate German-Russian peace unnecessary and, a revolution avoided and the history of the balance of the Twentieth Century immeasurably altered.  We will never know but Gallipoli challenges us to appreciate, to analyze and to read more.  For this it is a excellent tome.I did receive a free copy of this book in the hopes, but without the obligation, to write a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A8PRPWTNQ3IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TVLDTUM#wasThisHelpful","R3A8PRPWTNQ3IX","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It has a larger screen than some DVD players.  The picture is sharp, the colors are vivid and the sound is excellent.  It is light enough for easy transportation and comfortable to hold on ones lap.  The screen rotates to permit placement in multiple ways and view from several angles.  As a DVD viewer this is an excellent choice.

"The Presidents Club is a fascinating introduction to that exclusive fraternity of men who have served as President of the United States.  It is a web in which political rivals unite to protect the office, serve their country and world and and find ways to make themselves useful.The modern club began when Harry Truman invited Herbert Hoover to undertake the task of food relief to war torn Europe.  Although Hoover resented being the scapegoat again in 1948 he was willing to help reorganize the Federal Government under both Truman and Eisenhower.The relationships have been as diverse as the members and party divisions have largely been left behind.  Truman was an irascible character who liked to be remembered, by some but not all of his successors, who did undertake at least one you-die I fly mission.  Eisenhower was an advisor and confident to Kennedy and Johnson in war and peace.  Johnsons club membership kept him quiet as Nixon adhered more to the Johnson policies than Democrats of his day.  Thereafter presidents became helpers and tricksters.  Nixons continued dalliance in foreign affairs and Carters globe-trotting and free-lance diplomacy produced tense moments in the West Wing and, on occasion, accusations of treason.  Perhaps the closest and most productive bonding was between the Bushes and the other brother, Bill Clinton.  President Obama, like his predecessors, has learned to employ the talents of those few who know what it is like to sit behind the desk and make the decisions that change history.What I found most interesting about this is the non-partisanship of the Club.  Truman and Hoover could work together better than Hoover did with Eisenhower or Truman with Kennedy.  Ike could be a stern father-figure for Kennedy and a confessor to Johnson, while maintaining a distant relationship with Nixon.  Nixon and Reagan would be rivals while Ford was troubled by both.  Carter would create havoc for Clinton and Clinton would become good friends with the Bushes.Authors Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy provide an insight into powerful personalities and their role in governance through the counsel each provides his successors and how recent presidents have learned to use their predecessors.  It is a worthwhile read for any student of the modern American Presidency.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RUYS7340KN9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442362901#wasThisHelpful","R1RUYS7340KN9B","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been said that the history of the United States cannot be told until the history of every state is told.  Moses Robinson And The Founding Of Vermont places a key piece in the puzzle of American history.This book is part biography but mostly history.  Moses Robinson was major player in the early history of Vermont.  An early settler of Bennington in Southwestern Vermont, strong faith guided him to positions of prominence in the Church of Christ in Bennington while his skills in government drew him into political affairs.  Robinson would serve as a delegate to constitutional conventions, Governors Councilor, legislator, Vermont Supreme Court Justice, Agent to the U.S. Congress and U.S. Senator, to name a few of the many roles he played on historys stage.  The back cover says Moses Robinson may be the most important Founding Father of Vermont youve never heard of.  After reading this book I think I know why.  His importance is shown by the many positions he filled during his long career.  I believe that his anonymity results from his adherence to the Republican Party of Jefferson in a region and a state that turned into a Federalist stronghold.  Although wielding tremendous influence through his many positions, he served only one year as governor and less than one term in the U.S. Senate, in contrast to the long careers he would likely have enjoyed had he been a Federalist or lived in a Jeffersonian state.That is the biography part.  As I said, most of this work is history, and a fascinating and unique history it is. Contrary to what many Americans probably believe, Vermont was not one of the original thirteen colonies and states.  Contested by New Hampshire and New York and, to a limited extent Massachusetts, the early days of the Green Mountains was an era of conflicting land claims and vigilante justice during the specter of becoming a battle ground in a colonial Civil War overshadowed development of this northern land.  Often devoid of protection of the Continental Congress, the winds of war swept across Vermont during the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars and the War of 1812.  Petitions for statehood were held up for years by conflicting claims of citizens, neighboring states and Britain.  Although adopting forms that we associate with state government, Vermont functioned as an independent republic from 1777 to 1791 while negotiating with Congress and, for a time, with Britain for a lasting association.  Admission to the Union as the fourteenth state in 1791 brought an end to uncertainty and ushered in a period during which Vermont would be the fastest growing state.Author Robert A. Mello has thoroughly researched his topic and skillfully woven the life of Moses Robinson into the history of Vermont from 1741 to 1813.  Returning to the first sentence of this review, the unique history of Vermont paints the portrait of early America more vividly than that of any other state.  How is it that American territory could be so hotly disputed by its sister states as to be excluded from the Union?  The confiscation of Tory estates is often presented as a retaliatory violation of civil rights but here it is shown as the only way that the Revolution could be financed.  Could even loyal Americans have seriously negotiated for British protection from New Hampshire and New York or were they just dangling lures to buy time and a truce?  How different was the independence of the Republic of Vermont from that of states under the Articles of Confederation?  It takes the Vermonts tale to frame these questions on early America.If you are a Vermonter, you will enjoy this Moses Robinson and The Founding of Vermont for its insights into your states origins.  If you identify with one of the other 49 states, read it for its window into the America of the Revolution, the evolution of our first parties and the tentative steps by which the States became United.  Either way you will be richly rewarded.I received a free copy of this book with the hope, but not the requirement, that I post a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31MCQHTVWNA6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0934720657#wasThisHelpful","R31MCQHTVWNA6Z","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"the Rise and Fall of Oscar the Magician is geared for 4-6 year olds.  The story is about two monkeys competing for the title of Magician of the Year.  One of the two main characters pursues the title by sabotaging the other characters tricks.  Although he is eventually caught, this presents values that should not be taught to children of this age. To the end the miscreant is claiming success in carrying out his crime.

"Women Remember the War is a fascinating collection of oral histories of 25 Wisconsin women who lived through World War II.  It consists of edited versions of interviews done in the early 1990s.The chapters are organized by the womens experience with some women appearing in multiple sections.  The factory worker, the single employed, the mothers, those who wore uniforms and they who waited for their men to return all have their tales to tell.This is not polished writing, but neither is it disorganized facts.  The subjects narrate their stories in their own words.  Editor Michael E. Stevens selects the passages and organizes them so as to maintain the readers interest throughout this 157 page tome.What I like best about this work is the way insights jump off the page.  You are reading along normally when suddenly something hits you.  It may trigger a memory, reveal an aspect of which you had never thought or incite an I didnt know that moment.Jane Heinemanns recollection of how her rendition of Begin The Beguine gave a wounded soldier the will to live reminds me of the spell it had over a woman of World War II age whom I knew. The inconvenience of rationing comes up again and again.  Rose Kaminskis practice of taking her main meal at lunch in the factory cafeteria to save the coupons for the family was a clever way of coping while  Marjorie Mileys comment that they had to save up their sugar coupons for a wedding cake, particularly one with icing, reduces the war to the very practical.  I have heard of  about conflicts between different ethnic groups and Emily Koplins description of the Polish, German and Italian neighborhoods rings true while her comments about the Germans speaking of what Hitler was trying to accomplish and the reluctance to bring up certain topics in some neighborhoods emphasizes the importance ethnic loyalties still played.  To me at least, Gene Gutkowskis fathers opinion that Irish are fine is personally reassuring.  WAAC Frieda Schurchs reminiscences of being stationed in an area where the mosquitoes were too bad for the POWs still stings, but there are also the downright humorous.  You have to chuckle at WAC Julie Davenports recitation of her response to Well, you know, Id like more potatoes with You know the rules, get going before looking up to see that she was talking to Eleanor Roosevelt.The subjects are all Wisconsin women but their experiences are common to American women from coast to coast. Whether you remember World War II, or just heard your mothers and grandmothers speak of it, Women Remember the War will be an enjoyable and rewarding read.  We are fortunate that the Wisconsin Historical Society has preserved these tales for us.I did receive a free copy of this book for reading and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LXTHRZJ1TU5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0870202723#wasThisHelpful","R2LXTHRZJ1TU5Q","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Truman Presidency is a thorough, unbiased examination of a crucial era of hot and cold war, peace, labor unrest, political scandal, Communists in government and third party movements.  It presents President Truman as a man who stepped into the shoes of a giant and filled them triumphantly.  It begins with a brief background biography stretching from Missouri farms to French battlefields through the Jackson County Courthouse and the Senate Chamber.The bulk of this work, naturally, centers on the almost eight years Truman spent working, although not always living, in the White House.  Someone too young to remember and who has not studied it will be amazed at the rapid fire challenges the administration faced.  From the first days of the United Nations and Potsdam Conferences, through the return to Independence Harry was riding the tiger and managing to hold on.Coming into office with the confidence of those who worked with him but not the nation at large, Truman had to secure the line of succession, complete the conquest of Japan, establish the parameters of Cold War cooperation and confrontation, stare down labor and management in the steel, railroad and coal industries and by trial and error release wartime wage and price controls.  For all this the Democratic Party suffered a crushing defeat in the 1946 mid-term elections.1948 brought Draft-Ike movement, a resurgent Republican Party, the Dixiecrat rebellion in the South and the Wallace liberal splinter in the north.  By force of will and dogged determination Truman pulled off the upset of the century.Second term travails included more labor trouble, war in Korea and the firing of Gen. MacArthur.  At its end, with determined spirit but minimal public support, Harry stepped aside and had to watch while he gracefully turned over the presidency to the General who barely concealed his low opinion of his predecessor.This book is thoroughly researched and well written.  Published in 1966, it is now dated and has been followed by works having the advantage of more available archives and deeper reflection.  History is not just made, it is written.  Readers get a better appreciation of historical characters by reflecting on how they are interpreted in varying eras following their exits from the world stage.  Author Cabell Philips gives us a view of the Truman presidency through the window of the Johnson years, after Eisenhower had retired and before the Great Society, Watergate and Vietnam turned the prisms through which we view all that went before them.  It should not be your introduction to the Truman Presidency, but it should be part of your library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UVFZ47DSTJVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KYI3RW#wasThisHelpful","R2UVFZ47DSTJVX","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Harry Trumans pre-presidential career usually is covered fairly quickly in his biographies but it is the sole focus of Truman: The Rise To Power.  It covers the whole story from the Missouri frontier to school days, on the farm and through the War, the establishment and failure of his haberdashery and the beginnings of his political career up to the day of his presidential oath.It is quite a saga with a few surprising twists.  It is the story of a boy whose glasses kept him out of the rough and tumble and drove him into the library where he read every book.  Inspired by tales of great lives he sought military training in the Missouri National Guard that took him to France and World War I.  Having found a partner in Eddie Jacobson and experience with a successful regimental canteen they opened a haberdashery in downtown Kansas City catering to young men on the move and army buddies.  His dabbling in oil exploration and Savings & Loans and banks gave him contacts and life lessons and some money, but not enough to capture his career.  When all else had failed he was approached by the Pendergast machine to whom he represented a clean farmer with a sufficient network of connections weaving through work, the Masons, Battery D vets, relatives and friends to make him the ideal candidate to win the Eastern District judgeship on the Jackson County Court.  Although he recognized that Pendergast men overcharged on county projects and collected pay that they did not earn, he was an exceptionally good judge, building a road system that helped make Jackson County a model for the nation.  After disappointling his ambitions for Governor or Congress, Pendergast found him to be an acceptable candidate to take a U.S. Senate seat for the organization.  Upon arrival in the capitol the Senator from Pendergast gradually earned respect through hard work and his committees exposure of waste in war contracts until he became the Democratic nominee for Vice-President.Author Richard Lawrence Miller takes a different approach from the accepted Truman legend, that of the honest businessman who paid off his creditors even when he did not have to and the politician who, though surrounded by crooks, never used his position for personal gain.  While recognizing Trumans personal integrity, this work presents a man who had more obligations for his business debts than is generally recognized, who settled for fractions of amounts owed, relied on the fact that his salary as county judge could not be garnished for debt and who got some help in managing his loans but who, in the end, could not prevent foreclosure on the family farm.I have read several books by and about Harry Truman.  I value this one for its emphasis on his pre-presidential life and the realistic assessment of a businessman and politician who tried to advance and make ends meet while doing some things that might have been avoided by one anticipating a presidential run.  Like any book, its facts and conclusions are subject to scrutiny.  Contrary to everything else I have read on the subject, Miller concludes that FDR brought Truman up to date on the atomic bomb project when they met for lunch during the 1944 campaign.  I also question whether Truman really planned the quiet campaign for the vice-presidency that this book suggests.  Those misgivings aside, I think that it provides the reader with a well-researched introduction to the rise of a most significant character in the American Pageant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSU70NCA3YVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0070421854#wasThisHelpful","R3PSU70NCA3YVS","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lincolns Boys is really a triple biography.  The two primary figures are John Hay and John Nicolay, the two young men who traveled from Illinois to serve as Lincolns secretaries and devoted much of their remaining lives to the promotion of his image.  The third character is Lincoln himself: Lincoln they man with whom they lived and worked and the Lincoln of legend.John Nicolay was a young Bavarian immigrant was a lively dancer and talented musician who served as de-facto executive director of the nascent Republican Party in Illinois while abhorring the mobs that he would encounter on the trip to Washington and daily in the White House.  After leaving the White House he would serve as a diplomat in Paris and as Marshall of the United States Supreme Court.John Hay was a more outgoing people person with the talents of an author and a poet who served in diplomatic posts in Paris, Vienna, Madrid and as Ambassador to Great Britain before concluding his public service as Secretary of State under Presidents McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.Their life stories are interesting but what makes them worthy of a book is their association with Abraham Lincoln.  It was they who accompanied him to the telegraph office, were at his side as he wrote the Emancipation Proclamation, mingled with the press and politicians during the trip to Gettysburg and acted as his intermediator and buffer when dealing with members of Congress.As Lincolns intimates, Nicolay and Hay were entrusted with the creation of Lincolns historic image.  Having access to the Lincoln papers through their friend, Robert Lincoln, they wrote a ten volume official biography.  From it would come many of the legends of Lincoln Lore such as the incident in which Gen. McClellan returned home and went to bed while Lincoln waited to see him and the blind memo in which he got each cabinet member to agree to prosecute the war after the election and so that it would be won before the inauguration.I found insights in this book that I do not remember reading before, such as the idea that the visit to Gettysburg served political purposes and that Hay might have written the Letter to Mrs. Bixby, a Southern sympathizer who promptly threw it out.  It mentions that four score and seven years ago pointedly refers to the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution that protected slavery as well as the virulent opposition to Lincoln during his lifetime.Much of this work is devoted to a study of the multi-faceted struggle for Lincolns image in which Nicolay and Hay were the scribes for the Lincoln family.  Lincolns former partner, William Herndon,  strove to tear Lincoln down as merely an ordinary westerner while his longstanding vendetta with Mary Lincoln was the source of the legend that she made Lincolns domestic life a misery.  Southern writers advanced the case that states rights and diverging economic systems and not slavery brought on the Civil War.  Lincolns Boys, with their aggressive Northernism, softened the role of Mary, kept the slavery issue front and center and portrayed Lincoln as a man whose humble background made his greatness even more impressive that it would have seemed in others.  As I was reading I was reminded of what I have been taught about the Gospels, that each evangelist chose the stories to include and to tell them in a way that would get across the message that he desired.  Lincoln seems to have been treated similarly.  Each biographer emphasizes and interprets facts so as to create his own Lincoln.Author Joshua Zeitz has made a valuable contribution to the Lincoln literature.  His readers will better understand the evolving role of Lincoln in our history.  He has crafted an easy, but not a light read, a fairly quick, but satisfying one.  Lincolns Boys is the perfect book to read as we close the Sesquicentennial of the Lincoln Presidency.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MDH3IAGQ9IEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025666#wasThisHelpful","R1MDH3IAGQ9IEX","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I was offered a sample of this VINOMIO Wine Chiller for testing and review I thought that it might be an attractive alternative to the traditional ice bucket or wine sleeve.  It is.  You need to pour about a half glass to make room for the Chiller.  The frozen stainless steel rod keeps the wine cool while you enjoy your meal.  Naturally it works better when there is more in the bottle because more of the wine is in contact with the rod.  The spout makes for easy, drip free pouring. We look forward to using this at our next home party.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YN62VCM8T22L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJ7BMBS#wasThisHelpful","R1YN62VCM8T22L","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the minds of many Americans John Wilkes Booth appears spontaneously as an accomplished actor standing outside of the Presidential Box in Fords Theatre which he enters, shoots Lincoln, jumps onto the stage and rides off to someplace where he is shot.  Fortunes Fool tells us the rest of the story.John Wilkes Booth was the scion of an acting family, son of premier Shakespearean actor Julius Brutus Booth and younger brother of Edwin.  Portrayed as a likeable, witty and outgoing young man, Wilkes career took him across America from the east coast as far west as Missouri.  This book provides a balanced account of its subject, showing, for example, that the claim that he was not the actor that his father was may reflect that he died at age 26, to early for his talents had time to mature.  His Maryland upbringing contributed to his pro-Southern sentiments, although Edwin was a Union man who voted for Lincoln in 1864.Roughly half of the book deals with Booths personal and professional life before transitioning, as did that life, into a fixation on politics, the Confederate cause and Lincoln.  Readers will receive an introduction to the antebellum thespian landscape.  Author Terry Alford places Booth in the context of his times and the movement.  He was far from the only Southerner who plotted to kidnap Lincoln to exchange him for some concessions to the Confederacy.  As Southern prospects faded and Lee surrendered Booths aim turned from kidnapping for an exchange to murder for revenge.  Drawing inspiration from his characters, Wilkes saw himself as a modern day Brutus who shed blood to save his country from a perceived tyrant.  Booth is portrayed as a true Southern patriot, one attached to the cause, not to its heroes.  He lost faith in Lee when he met Grant and saw himself as the one who would avenge Southern honor.  This tome progresses fairly quickly through the assassination itself and Booths desperate flight into Virginia to the rendezvous with the New York cavalryman who would kill him.  In death Booth remained a hero and fiend, buried in a grave both unmarked and frequently decorated.Readers must be aware that this book is a whole life biography.  While it devotes almost half of the book to the assassination, its preparation and flight, it is fit into the context of a life of the subject and that of a turbulent of a nation on the verge of reuniting.  What I appreciated most about it is its portrayal of the milieu in which Booth lived and acted. I find it amazing that there were so many plots, involving so many people and known of by countless others.  We read of Booth wandering into, through and out of this culture of intrigue amidst the targets of its actions.Readers seeking a detailed account of the Lincoln assassination would be better served by looking elsewhere.  This is a book for those wondering how Wilkes Booth developed into the man who would plot the attack and do the deed.  I acquired a better understand of the theatre of Booths day and the political climate in which he thought that he would achieve heroic status by killing the President and why, in the eyes of some, he did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VC0DT5NYDP80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195054121#wasThisHelpful","R2VC0DT5NYDP80","A32ZKBXJJ45BRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32ZKBXJJ45BRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 3-in-1 LED Flashlight with Magnetized Base by AYL is three tools in one.  It is a bright LED beam emitting from the front.  The second click turns on a handle panel of 18 white lights and the third lights the eight flashing red lamps in the handle panel and four in a plastic ring around the spotlight.  To top it off it has a strong magnet in the end.  Its thin, light weight construction makes it easy to grasp.This light has multiple uses.  It is a very good flashlight, particularly for one operating on three AAA batteries.  The white lights in the handle can illuminate a room or provide hands free lighting in those hard to see areas.  Either end provides a base and the magnet enables it to hang from any metallic surface, such as a car or a refrigerator.  The flashing red lights signal warning.My family and I are already debating where to keep it so we can find it during the next power outage.  I am definitely thinking about using the magnet to affix it the next time I take a look under the hood.

"This was fun to use and worked fine, but I think the old-fashioned hand-powered nail file & buffing block is more effective at a fraction of the price.  I had heard great things about other Amope products so I jumped at the opportunity to give this a try.  I used it on both my hands and feet.  The product contains a wand with a vibrating tip -- kind of reminded me of an electric toothbrush -- and three attachments that slip onto the tip of the wand.  The attachments are for filing, smoothing, and buffing.  The filing attachment worked well and allowed me to get a very smooth edge on my nails.  I found it a little cumbersome on my hands, but easy to use on my feet.  The smoothing tip -- hard to tell what exactly it did.  The buffing tip did a great job of polishing my nails to a shiny luster, but it took some time to get that effect.  The high-luster buffed finish doesn't last long, and I felt myself wanting to buff again an hour later.  This kit was fun to use, but I doubt I will use it regularly, as a nail file & $5 buffing block, like  is easier to use and just as effective.

Interesting and tragic characters, particularly the narrator, who seems to be stumbling along through life yet oddly on top of things.  The first half was more fast-paced and intriguing than the last half, and the pace slowed down a bit about 3/4 way through the book.

As far as puppets and plush toys go, this seems to be very high quality and somewhat realistic looking.  I go back and forth between thinking its adorable and finding the odd black spots to be disturbing, especially the one over eye.  It is incredibly soft and huggable.  And fairly large.  Although it is labeled as a hand puppet -- it's really more like a plush toy with a hold for your hand to slip inside.  I couldn't figure out how to ""animate"" the puppet with my hand.

"This book started out with a bang but started to fizzle about halfway through.  Cohen is a gifted writer, with a lovely way with words.  Her narrative is engaging and her story is fascinating.  She discusses all the seeming inexplicable learning and spatial difficulties she's faced in life -- and the process by which she is subsequently diagnosed with a lemon-sized hole in her brain.  Thank you Ms. Cohen for including illustrations -- so the reader can really envision what you are talking about.  Despite her brain disorder, Cohen seems to cope effectively, making it through a rather unique and largely self-directed degree program, maintaining friendships with her college classmates, and completing a graduate degree in writing.The second half of the book --- about Cohen's post-collegiate life, her bumpy relationship with and eventual separation from her boyfriend Charlie, her series of roommates in Oakland, and her efforts to obtain Social Security disability is just not as gripping or well-written as the first part of the book, and seems to lack focus.  Cohen's narrative becomes rambles and focuses on details that aren't particularly interesting or germane to her condition.  Second half of the book seems like a personal diary or journal that Cohen presents in its original form -- without any editing for public consumption.  It's as if she is wallowing and attempting to come to terms with her condition, but she shares a lot of esoteric information in the process.Overall, this started off as a fascinating read.

"My husband had to darken his salt and pepper hair to look younger for a community theater role.  I suggested he use something non-permanent to avoid the stark roots after the role was over and after striking out at the local stores, we decided to give this a try. .  This effectively darkened his gray hair and looked very natural; it didn't at all create the ""you must have just dyed your hair"" reaction.  It did not turn his mostly-white hair stark black, but more of a darker gray.  The costume director said he looked younger, so mission accomplished.  It had the slightest blue/purple tinge, but it wasn't bad -- I was perfectly happy to be seen with my hubby in public.  I wouldn't recommend this for full gray coverage, but I think it would work well if you had just a few grays to cover or if you were looking for a temporary fix.  So far it has held up well through several shampoos.  Not sure how it will do in the long run.

"This is an amazing belt -- love it and wear it nearly every time I wear my jeans.  The design is interesting but not too over the top, the shading gives it a nice vintage look, and the leather is thick and strong.  The little rivets add a bit of interest without being too clingy.  I wear it all the time and it doesn't show any wear -- other than the nice vintage effect.  Came back to buy a second belt as my old one doesn't quite fit any more and was disappointed to see the brown was unavailable.Don't hesitate to buy from Beltiscool -- the products I've tried all really nice.  I would caution you to go for the full-grain leather belts, even though they are a little pricier, because they hold up much better to frequent use.

"This beautiful case fits my phone perfectly and has protected it during several falls.  It appears to be of excellent quality.  I wasn't sure I would prefer the leather to my old hard plastic case but I've grown to love it.  It feels luxurious to hold.  Mud slide is a rich, deep saddle tan color in a pebbled texture.UPDATE on August 1, 2015:  The thin layer of purple leather has separated from the hard plastic lining on all four side of this case.  I may try to glue it back on, but I doubt it would work well.  This was a beautiful case, but I am disappointed with its longevity.

"Paleo diet = NO grains, dairy, legumes, eggs, nuts seeds, nightshades (tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, eggplant), coffee, alcohol, processed vegetable oils, or processed sugars.  Also no spices derived from nightshades, such as curry powder, chili powder,or paprikaPaleo diet = YES to meats, meats, and more meats, with extra credit for eating organ meats.  Bacon is front and center in several recipes, and bacon fat and lard (from pasture-raised pigs) is a ""good"" fat.  Also includes veggies, fruit, fats, and coconut products (like coconut flour)Paleo diet has been getting a lot of press lately for its purported ability to heal a leaky gut and help tame the symptoms of autoimmune diseases.  As someone who has one of those aforementioned autoimmune diseases, I'm always on the lookout for something that will help keep symptoms in check.  I would certainly try some, but not most, of the recipes in this book.  The photography is beautiful, and most of the food LOOKS good.  I first opened the book to what looked like a wrap or burrito with a creamy sauce and meat filling -- looks yummy -- but when I read the recipe, well, I'm just not going to go through the effort to cook, carefully peel, and shred two pounds of beef tongue to make Crispy Beef Tongue Wraps wrapped in collard green leaves.  Some of the recipes seem straightforward -- steak fajitas, seared lamb chops with garlic & herb whipped artichoke ""butter"", grilled beef skewers, guacamole, caramelized Brussels sprouts.  But many seem complicated and not particularly appealing.  How do you make BBQ sauce without tomatoes?  You use pumpkin puree, fish sauce, bacon fat, coconut amino, molasses, and a few other ingredients.  Salsa?  Use canned beets, pumpkin puree, and diced red onion along with lime and cilantro.I also sense that the Paleo diet doesn't limit fat intake, as long as it's an approved fat, and many of these recipes seem like they would be very high in fat.  Duck Fat Burgers with Mango & Avocado Spread, for example, or Sausage Benedict in Portobello Mushroom Caps, or Pork Bellies with Apples.  I realize that the Paleo diet does not claim to be a weight-loss diet, but as someone who has always struggled with her weight, I shudder to think of how many calories many of these recipes contain.  Oatmeal made from coconut flakes?  Yikes.  That recipe actually sounds pretty delicious to me, but dreadfully fattening.Some of the more unusual recipes:""Oatmeal"" made from coconut and acorn squashChicken fried steak, dipped in a mixture of coconut milk and ground chicken (since egg is verboten) and breaded in plantain crumbsWarm Chicken ""Grain"" salad with roasted butternut squash, where apparently you process pieces of cooked chicken in a food process to make little rice-sized ""grains""Banana-Carob Pudding, made from mashed banana and avocado, and topped with bacon and coconut cream.Rosemary Flatbread -- with the ""bread"" made from a dough of plantains, tapioca starch, coconut flour,Things that I would try:Chicken tacos, with jicama rounds as ""shells"", with blueberry salsa and avocado creamChicken & Bacon bites -- little chicken meatballs made moist with bacon.If you want to give Paleo a try, by all means take a look at this cookbook.  It is nicely-packaged and is full of tips on how to create interesting flavors within the confines of the diet -- like curry that doesn't use any forbidden curry powder.  Just be aware that this diet is certainly not for everyone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HK7SVK1W6LQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624141021#wasThisHelpful","R3HK7SVK1W6LQL","A2HOLM5I1ARX9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HOLM5I1ARX9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered a belt like this from beltiscool about a year ago and absolutely loved it.  AWESOME belt and great service from Beltiscool.  It was favorite belt to wear with jeans -- the leather was high quality, the design was interesting but not over the top, I liked the little metal rivets (and for more than a year now, they have held up), and the buckle was nice.  The old one was a little large, so I found my original order on amazon and came back to order the same belt in a different size.  Unfortunately, it was out of stock and I found this similar belt instead. This belt arrived immediately -- shipping was lightning fast.  I didn't like it as is much as the one I ordered previously, and thought that -- the leather is a little shinier, not as vintage looking.  Beltiscool customer service responded promptly and explained that this was a different style.FYI, if you're shopping around for belts on Amazon -- Beltiscool did make a similar design in bonded leather.  It's much less expensive, of course, but it doesn't look as nice after about three wearings, and it doesn't hold up nearly as well.  If you want something that will stand up to lots of use, make sure you go for the full-grain leather.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27IN0EJWZTY41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PIFLW36#wasThisHelpful","R27IN0EJWZTY41","A2HOLM5I1ARX9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HOLM5I1ARX9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""swirled mattifier"" (step three), an ever-so-slightly green tinged primer/moisturizer, alone makes this system worth the money.  It gave my skin a beautiful matte finish and helped keep the greasies away all day.  Honestly, I got so many compliments on my skin when I used the mattifier under my makeup that I would buy this just for the mattifier.  It worked well and is so much less slimy than other under-makeup primers I've tried.  Caveat -- I am fairly fair-skinned, and when I first applied the mattifier, it left my skin looking a tad pale and chalky.  But with a little powder on top, I was good to go.  I can't imagine that the mattifier would work as well on tawny or chocolatey skin tones, but I can't exactly test it to find out.  To me, the mattifier did not feel particularly ""moisturizing,"" but I imagine it might on oilier skin.  I think the mattifier might be more appealing to older acne and rosacea sufferers than to young tweens and teens in the same predicament.As for the deep scrub and spot zinger, I'm sure they work just fine, like similar products containing 2% salicylic acid.  I liked the feel of the scrub.  It was not too abrasive or drying, it did not burn or sting, and it left my skin feeling super clean and the tiniest bit tingly.  Likewise, no objections to the spot treatment, which comes with an applicator with a very narrow tip (think super glue) which really lets you pinpoint where you want to apply it.  As for the purported citrus mint scent -- hmmm -- it's no Yankee Candle.  To me, it had the slightest medicinal scent, though it was completely inoffensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PSSP6CZ0OC52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKD61GA#wasThisHelpful","R2PSSP6CZ0OC52","A2HOLM5I1ARX9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HOLM5I1ARX9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lovely razor -- it has a rubbery grip that is easy to hold, with a little indent in the handle for your thumb.  The razor has six blades, advertised on the packaging as ""3x3 blades"" (time for a refresher course in fourth grade math).  I'm not sure that six blades are better than five or four or two, but more is better seems to be the trend these days, and it does provide a smooth shave.  The razor head has a hinge in the middle, with three blades below the hinge and three blades above the hinge.  The head flexes at the joint about 45 degrees, and the head flexes up to about 45 degrees from the razor's handle, so you get tremendous you get tremendous flexibility and can really get around curves easily.The razor purportedly has a ""moisturizing band"", containing aloe, lavender, and vitamin E, but I didn't notice that it left my legs feeling particularly moisturized; and it is definitely no substitute for lotion or shaving cream.  I wasn't particularly impressed with the moisturizing strip.  It doesn't hold a candle to the Schick Intuition, which I really like.Blades are super easy to load and dispose of, with a single push of a button on the handle.  The razor is super easy to clean.  It is packaged with a little suction-cup holder can stick on your shower wall which hasn't fallen off yet -- though they usually do.  The razor is comfortable, works well, and is easy to hold and use, due to the rubbery grip.

"I LOVE the taste of the  lemon Promax bars.  They're delicious -- lemony goodness covered in something akin to white chocolate, definitely like a sweet treat!  They're fairly filling -- but they taste so very good I don't want to stop after one.  I have also tried the Nutty Butter bars.  They're okay, but they have a more chewy sweet, candy barish but less distinctive flavor.  No risk of mistaking them for a Butterfinger, though.  These bars are large (compared to most bars) and pack a powerful protein punch -- 20 grams.  But it comes at a price -- high calories, at 290-300 calories a pop, and a ton of sugar, like 28 grams.  If you are just looking for the protein and don't mind the sugar and calories, you won't go wrong with these.  If you're looking for something less sugary, I would recommend Quest protein bars.  They're a little more expensive but they taste good and they're not loaded with sugar.

"This bracelet is very pretty, sturdy, and and appears to be very well made.  The cuff is silver and the clear stones are set in yellow gold -- so it will match anything.  It is perfect for stacking.  I have two and they fit together really nicely.  They are super comfortable and I hardly notice they are on.  I wear these almost every day.As a note, this 7.5"" cuff fits very well on my larger wrist, much better than many  bracelets I've tried.  It might be a little too loose on someone with small wrists, but it works well on me.  Before I purchased these, I noticed that the price jumped around quite a bit, varying by as much as $20, so if you're thinking about purchasing you might want to track the price for a few days first.UPDATE:  I purchased two of these.  Within the first month, two stones fell out of one of the bracelets.  Fortunately, it was within the 30-day exchange period and Amazon allowed me to exchange it.  Just a few weeks later, I noticed that the new bracelet and the older bracelet are both missing stones.  I still think this is a very pretty bracelet, but I doubt I am able to replace the stones.

"I love Quest Protein Bars -- great flavors, low sugar, low in calories for the amount of protein -- and I thought I might branch out and try some of their other products.  These chips are high in protein and low in fat and sugar -- but thats about as far as their merits go.  They just don't taste very good at all.  They don't have a good mouth feel, and they seem to suck all the moisture out of my mouth -- like I'm chewing on a wad of paper towels or something.  These require a big glass of water as an accompaniment.  It is nice to be able to taste the salty/savory flavor a little bit, particularly if you've been snack-deprived, but the thrill wears off quickly.  I found the sea salt to be particularly flavorless, and green onion is my favorite.  Worth a try if you're looking for high protein/low carb munchies, but I doubt I purchase these again.

"Winston (yep, named after the cigarette) lives with her grandma, and their pets -- a dog and a rooster-- in small town Florida.  Although Nanny has worked (and longed) for a wealthy restaurateur for many years, it seems she barely has two nickels to rub together.  Winston's mother, who goes by Skye Harper, ran off to California to pursue fame and fortune when Winston was quite young, and ended up as a substitute show girl in Las Vegas.  Skye has decided it is time to come home, so she asks Winston and Nanny to come fetch her in Vegas.  While her boss is out of the country, Nanny ""borrows"" his fancy motor home to embark on the cross-country trip.  Her boss's teenaged son, Steve, who is intrigued by the quirky Winston, hides in the RV and tags along on the trip.  And off they go to Vegas.  The journey brings new love, rekindled love, discovery, and abandonment.  The ending isn't quite believable but what the heck.I liked the ""choppy"" style and short chapters; they seem well-suited to the attention span of the intended young adult readers, and seem to more realistically convey the journaling style.  Winston occasionally sometimes seems very grounded and together and other times completely flaky.  She dreams of becoming  an Olympic swimmer, yet she is not on her school's swim team; she sneaks into the school pool to practice when no one is around.  She and Nanny are quirky but on the whole, likable.  This is set in the 1970's.  Much of it seemed very real to me, although I wonder if a tween reader would have sufficient context to make sense of the 70's references.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AGJNMGEH3XWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481400320#wasThisHelpful","R3AGJNMGEH3XWW","A2HOLM5I1ARX9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HOLM5I1ARX9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I only give half a tab to my son. Full tab knocked him out that it was scary. I searched for sleep aid for children during a very rough transition to time when we came back from Asia. We are also at a phase where he just refuses sleep and could be up until midnight. This helps him fall asleep easier and now he is only waking up once at around 5:30am. I've been just leaving his baby gate at his door open so he can walk to our room and snuggle with us until it's time to wake up. He doesn't need this on days he didn't nap - only the days when he has napped and still is up and running late at night. This boy could be up until midnight if you let him. I do not want to rely on this to help my son sleep. We do our best to get him tired during the day - play outside, go for walks, play catch, etc, I had also set up an air mattress right next to his bed. and wait for him to fall asleep just to help him feel comfortable that someone is next to him, we do warm lavender baths, and we do music lullaby.

"This was impressive! It fit so much stuff. This lasted 2 international flights and 3 domestic SO FAR. Suitcases are heavy and you are probably only able to fit in like 45lbs instead of the 50lb limit. But this is so light and so thin that you can fit soo much.

"This is a review based on first impressions, and on the use case for which we got the laptop.  I'll update if warranted.We got this as a secondary laptop for use by a teacher at an elementary charter school.  She will be using it for Internet browsing, email, and working on Word docs.  Possibly Excel docs in the future.  Nothing too demanding.Once I cleaned off the extraneous junk programs and got Office 365 installed and registered (free for a year), things worked well enough though slowly.  The keyboard is good.  What's left of the 32 GB SSD storage is enough for our purposes, especially if docs get stored in the cloud or on thumb drives or memory cards.  2 GB of memory is a tight limit; you won't do much multitasking.  But for browsing, email, and Word it's good enough.  The cheerful bright blue will fit in nicely at the elementary school.EXCEPT:  the touchpad is awful.  It simply does not respond properly to clicks and gestures, at least half the time.  We'll use a mouse instead.Windows 10 is an acquired taste, which we are in the process of acquiring.  At least it's better than Windows 8.

"I felt compelled to wait a few days after finishing My Name is Lucy Barton to see whether its impact stayed; sometimes a plainspoken book like this one turns out, in retrospect, to be just simple rather than ""deceptively simple"".But no.  The impact of Lucy Barton the character (and of her mother) and of the book stayed full force.  We follow Lucy Barton, a successful writer of (presumably literary) fiction through her life of emotional longing and outsiderness, starting with a nine-week hospital stay during which her mother visits for the first time since Lucy married.  The narration moves backward to childhood and adolescence and forward, eventually, to Lucy's ultimate success.  The reader has to keep her ears open; what  seem like throwaway details near the start of the book turn into plot points that echo throughout.  The book is a masterpiece of construction and slow disclosure - and welcome brevity.  There's more in these 200 or so pages than in many a saggy baggy modern novel (I'm looking at you, Telegraph Avenue, and at most of the work of Jonathan Franzen).Lucy is an off-kilter but deeply observant narrator, reminiscent of Lila in Marilynne Robinson's book of the same name.  Her story, and the mix of longing and love and distance between her and her mother will stay with you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q37BT0IYX2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400067693#wasThisHelpful","R3Q37BT0IYX2W","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here we have the last entry in The Science of Discworld series, where a Pratchett novella is interspersed with high-quality popular science writing that covers areas relevant to the novella.  Or perhaps vice versa.  In any case, there are two excellent science writers working with the one and only Terry Pratchett, from whom we will hear no more.  His daughter has stated that there will be no extensions of Discworld written by others, and that there are no abandoned manuscripts to be completed, and that the ideas in Sir Terry's files for new books will not be farmed out to others.If you've read the other SoD books you know what to expect here.  The theme is Priests vs Wizards for the control of Roundworld, which lets Pratchett and the scientists air their relgion-is-superstition-but-powerful views.  The latter-day sect of the Omnians do not distinguish themselves, even though The Great God Om makes an appearance.  If you remember Small Gods this bit has an extra kick.  The story is not top-drawer vintage Pratchett, but in 2011 - 2012 when this was probably written (originally published in 2013 in England) the man was still quite able though no longer at his peak.The science parts are not as lighthearted as usual, with some hard pushing of the logic-and-science-vs-supersition point.  The writing is fine at the sentence-and-paragraph level, but doesn't amount to a coherent view of a topic or small set of topics as the previous entries in the series were.Still worth your time and attention.  If you're a Pratchett fan you can always just give up and read the story sections.  It's interesting to see a Roundworld librarian encounter the UU's librarian, and we can root for the wizards to win.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q3K03HG48HNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804169004#wasThisHelpful","R3Q3K03HG48HNE","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deb Wise has a lot of experience creating light-ish desserts.  It's her day job, after all.  In this book she offers a good selection of meal-ending sweets, from pies and cookies and cakes and fruit-based-but-not-pie things to muffins and puddings.  Plenty of variety.Each recipe comes with a photo.  Each comes with clear directions - not to be taken lightly.  Each category comes with a few tips and techniques, some of which were new to me.But what of the recipes themselves?  Of course I've tried only a few, and can't speak for all.  The sweet-savory muffins were good, and the chocolate cookies ditto.  The biscotti recipe worked. I'm not a pie or cooked-fruit person so can't judge there.  But she doesn't just reduce the serving sizes.  These are genuinely lightened desserts that get the most taste for the reduction in calories.One large caveat:  she uses Cool-Whip in a lot of the mousse-type and pie-type recipes.  If you can't countenance that, the number of recipes you can use here is reduced by quite a bit.  If you're on the fence, check out her defense of the stuff.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJ2M4S041847/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0848744519#wasThisHelpful","R3AJ2M4S041847","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is a huge and elaborate cat condo, with plenty of levels and hiding places and even ladders for the elderly cat who might stoop to use one rather than leaping up.  There are three top perches, so your cats can work out their dominance issues by competing for the highest one.  Lots of rope-covered surfaces to sharpen claws on.It is HEAVY, and assembly is not simple.  The diagrams are clear enough and they label the pieces (except the screws).  BUT assembly starts with the middle rather than going top down or bottom up, which was confusing.  But, as long as you have two people available you can get it done.  Just keep referring to the picture of the finished item and you will probably not go wrong.  Note that the ladders are anchored only at the top.Quality is not great.  One of the steps for the ladders came off in the shipping box, and they're just stapled on.  We were able to whop that step back on, but I don't know if it will stay long.Our cats have not yet taken to it, but they're cats.

"It's useful to  have soft butter always available on the table.  You could leave your butter out like the Danes (for example) do, but that only works if you use a lot of butter or don't mind slightly rancid butter much of the time.The French trick of keeping butter at the right temperature with cold water has been around a while, but the containers are the wrong shape for the butter available in America.  This butter keeper solves that problem.  But be careful.  If your butter comes in the long sticks you want the company's other model.  If you use the shorter thicker sticks this is the one for you.It's possible to jam the longer stick into this model, but you have to cut and shape it which defeats the purpose and the convenience.Based on first impression, this is an excellent method of keeping butter soft without spoiling it.  I really like having room temperature butter available all the time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RTWPCO466PE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YUCNV46#wasThisHelpful","R2RTWPCO466PE4","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is not a sleek fashion case.The only drawback is that the pictorial instructions for opening the case to get your phone into it are ludicrous.

"Most of us probably think that atheism and skepticism about supernatural powers are relatively recent phenomena, and that before the Enlightenment and certainly in the ancient world everybody believed whatever the dominant society presented as its official religious belief.  Tim Whitmarsh's study of atheism (mainly in the classical world) affirms otherwise.  He starts the book with a chapter that presents the argument that skeptics toward the supernatural and miracles or supernatural beings have been present throughout history, and that there was always variety of unbelief, belief, and undecidedness (which we now call agnosticism).He goes on to present various authors and episodes of out and out atheism (mainly from plays or other art plus a few court records and philosophical treatises), belief in a different type of god than the society offered (Socrates and his personal daimon versus the ritualized sacrifices that the Greek polis performed publicly for one example), and other recorded evidence of skeptical or atheistic belief.  His learning is evident, and the scope of the inquiry is broad.  The book will be a valuable reference and roundup and guide for people interested in classical beliefs and in whatever skeptical or atheistic or unusual attitudes were reflected in literature, philosophy, and whatever court records and histories we have - ranging from pre-Homeric Greece through the classical period and on through Constantine.  Whitmarsh carefully distinguishes between the various types of unbelief and skepticism, and reminds us that the term and position of ""atheism"" means something different in the age and culture where monotheism is the religious norm than it did in ancient polytheistic times.As usual with such topics, you may find that the author is more interested in it than you are.  Nevertheless, this is a popular work, not intended simply for scholars.  It comes with full notes, which is welcome for those cases where you might be skeptical of a bit of information yourself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K596ALS2B1SG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307958329#wasThisHelpful","R1K596ALS2B1SG","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This latest entry in the series is one of the best, featuring superb suspense, splendid characters, just enough of the grotesque and macabre to keep a reader fascinated.  The image of the burning man is threaded so neatly into the plot that somehow reflects modern the problems of domestic terrorism and the anarchy of the mob while still evoking the spirit of wartime (WW II) London and Sherlock Holmes in The sign of the Four! The ending was not unexpected yet followed the classic arc of tragedy in a way that paid homage to it and elevated the story to an epic.  Christopher Fowler succeeds in having us care about the relationship between all the characters, not just Bryant and May, Janice Longbright or the various victims.I already know how it comes out but I've re-read the last few chapters over again twice.

"Chaya Deitsch lucked out in life.  She was raised in a close Hasidic (Lubavitcher) family with a warm and loving-but-not-smothering mother.  The family lived far enough away from Crown Heights so they were not under the direct and intense scrutiny of the community as they might have been.  The community rules were somewhat less rigid when she was growing up than they are now.  When she removed herself from the community, she was able to keep her connections to her family.  She's not angry, she's not out to show how bad she had it and how awful the community is. Thus her story is an important counterpoint to the recent burst of revenge memoirs by people who grew up Orthodox and by people who joined the Hasidic world and then left.The book traces her childhood, her transition to adulthood through a faraway yeshiva and then to a secular college.  At which point we leave her until the epilogue in which she tells her parents that she is no longer frum.  Of course they already know - they're no dummies - and her mother especially shows great character and parental skill in her reactions.My problem with the book is that Chaya Deitsch's childhood just isn't that interesting and her adolescence is nothing unusual - she's not all that externally rebellious and she narrates pretty much from her childhood and adolescent point of view, without much analysis or insight.  Her love for her extended family is clear throughout, however.  The few moments when insights break through the narrative are among the best in the book.  Her realization that non-Orthodox Jews don't think they're sad sinful failures at Judaism, but rather form their own communities with their own norms and customs that are satisfying to them is one example.It's only fair to judge the book as the author wrote it, without whining that I would prefer some different book.  But in this case I wanted to hear much more about the author's post-college life and current relationship with her sisters.  That's the real differentiator in this story over the many I-fled-Orthodox-oppression memoirs.  Perhaps she wanted to spare her sisters' privacy, a decision I respect.  Still, the best parts of the book are the beginning and ending sections.So, should you read this book?  Yes, if you want to know how someone can rebel without breaking ties to family.  Be warned, however:  you need a certain level of Jewish knowledge (or a certain facility with Google searches).  There are uncommon Yiddish terms (ainek'l for one) without a glossary, and language from prayers is quoted with no explanation.  This is a good thing, because it marks the book as not intended for those who simply want to gawk at the strange Hasidic world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIS1386R6D8NB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805243178#wasThisHelpful","RIS1386R6D8NB","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"National Geographic knows how to do a coffee table book, and is expert in combining text and graphics in a compelling narrative.  Here is the story of the Old West, our national westward movement and the frontier that shaped our culture for two centuries, conveyed in a series of short essays about events, people, and places.  Each comes with at least one truly stunning original picture, map, or photo.  The sequence of history is here, from  the Louisiana purchase and the Lewis and Clark expedition all the way through Teddy Roosevelt, statehood for the various territories, and the closing of the West.  Also, and more interestingly, we see how transportation, the Civil War and related tensions, settlement, Chinese railroad workers, mining, cowboys and sheepmen were all part of the economic and cultural story of the West.  And Indians, both as warriors and as mistreated residents of reservations and the schools that tried to stamp out their culture.The whole thing is splendid.  The graphics are superb, and used well.  The sidebars and illustrative stories are well-selected and well-written.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this beautiful presentation of the sweep and pettiness and glory and shameful episodes of the American West.  The less attractive parts of the story are not hidden, but not dwelt on disproportionately either.

"This is an excellent dog food.  Made in the USA, no strange chemical ingredients, and based on fish.  My dog LOVES it.  We started by mixing it with her previous weight control food to ensure that it didn't upset her stomach.  Success there, so we gradually increased the proportions.  She seems reasonably satisfied and full, though like all dogs she still scavenges from the floor.  Just less so.The drawback here is cost, at least for a large dog.  The four-pound bag would feed her for less than a week.  If you have a small dog who needs weight control food, the cost/benefit balance looks pretty good.  For a larger dog not so much.  We will probably use this stuff in rotation with other foods, as a reward.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROZALM2XM4DG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUIGNKQ#wasThisHelpful","ROZALM2XM4DG9","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Agile methodology (or approach) to software development is still relatively new.  The promise of Agile, when it is not used as an elaborate cover for the old no-process no-planning no-accountability way software was developed in the Very Bad Old Days, is that customers can be made happy with continuous delivery of software that gets ever closer to what they want - usable software that works without bugs and without security risks.So how do you find out whether your Agile team is producing as well as it can?  What do you measure?  How do you measure it?  In the new world of development and build and tracking tools, almost everything can be instrumented to provide data.  So how do you fulfill the Agile goal of measuring only what matters?  How do you figure out what matters?  Davis has provided lots of measurement tools with examples of the metrics produced AND several case studies that show how to implement his ideas AND guidance on how to discover what matters in your situation by measuring various things.  Finally, there is guidance on how to match metrics to the Agile principles and how to use the metrics to improve your team and processes - and products, which is what your customers care about.  And then there is an appendix with full and explicit info on constructing a metrics system using commonly available tools.This is a highly technical book; you have to understand the jargon and know modern software engineering and build processes to understand it and benefit from it  There is no list of acronyms and no glossary of concepts, so you really have to know the field.  The index is spotty and inconsistent, a minor irritant.  None of this ultimately matters if you're part of the intended audience of this book - Agile teams and their first-level supervisors and leads.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZM16ZGPCWS8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617292486#wasThisHelpful","R2ZM16ZGPCWS8R","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This year's entry in the Best American Essays anthology is filled with personal autobiographical essays, reflecting the interests of the editor, with few of the magazine-article type of essay that can be equally marvelous and personal and illuminating.  Which means that the bar is very high; the world is chockablock with memoirs and autobiographies, and there are a whole heck of a lot of writers who have already written about, say, aging.There are a few standouts here:  Isaiah Berlin's message to the 21st century, Margo Jefferson on her upbringing in a fiercely upper class Black family in the 50s, David Sedaris on whatever, Justin Cronin on his very young daughter's relationship with God and religion, Zadie Smith on New York life, and more.  The authors I find irritating are still irritating (though they may be favorites of yours): Sven Birkerts and Phillip Kennicott are represented by typical work.  For my money, neither of them succeeds in taking a common topic (growing up gay, being sick while also being an extremely sensitive guy) and making it interesting.  On the other hand, Tim Kreider makes owning and mourning a cat touching and interesting.Still, you'll probably find at least a few works here that get to you.  Recommended to fans of the series, who already know that quality varies within each volume.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OOSO6QN0WBIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544569628#wasThisHelpful","R3OOSO6QN0WBIY","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Middle Eastern flavors are irresistible, and the Israeli version that falls at the crossroads of many other cuisines in the region is no exception.  The success of Yotam Ottolenghi's series of cookbooks is proof of that.  Here we have another gorgeous cookbook that incorporates the personal story of a charismatic chef and also delivers reliable recipes for terrific food.There are lots of photos, the recipes are written clearly, and the book lies blessedly flat when you open it.  Why don't more publishers do that?  So far I've tried his version of tehina (garlic/tahini sauce) and dishes made with it; the amazing watermelon-feta-olive salad; Simple Sumac Onions; and his version of pita.  I prefer other pita recipes to his, but the other things I tried were beyond excellent.Some of the recipes require lots of ingredients, but few are exotic and many recur.  Few seem fussy for the sake of fussiness or presume that you have an army of prep cooks, though most require real effort at a level commensurate with the reward.  Plenty of them wring glorious flavor from everyday ingredients like lentils and rice and onions and ginger with herbs, while others depend on expensive fish or meat.So do you need this if you already have Ottolenghi's books?  Absolutely.  Solomonov's take on Israeli cooking is different enough that you'll want to get into it, and he knows how to tell a good story.  The book hits all the requirements for a cookbook in these days of recipes on the Internet: interesting recipes that work, an author with personality and a good story, and beautiful photos.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJOQTJVSRC20F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544373286#wasThisHelpful","RJOQTJVSRC20F","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had this product for an hour, and love it.  It solves the problems I had with my previous surge protector/USB charger thing, and has some extra virtues of its own.First, it has enough power to charge my iPad mini 3, which the previous item didn't.  When I connected the mini, it announced that it wasn't charging, though it actually did charge at a slow trickle rate.  This one just starts charging.Second, it accomodates more plugs - a total of six some of which are at an angle so you can acually plug in six items.Third, it has charging and grounding lights.Fourth, it comes with actually useful documentation, written with a little bit of humor.  The doc covers how to attach the plug to your outlet, because you have to remove the outlet plate mounting screw if there is one, or remove the surge protector's screw if you have a decorative plate with no mounting screw.  Sure, YOU can figure this out for yourself but there are other people on the planet who can't.  Plus a little humor in documentation, especially if it doesn't interfere with clear communication, is a good thing.  As a technical writer I'm envious of whoever got to write this booklet.It comes in the usual we-think-you're-a-thief-so-you-must-wrestle-to-liberate-your-purchase packaging.  Luckily you only have to liberate it once.  So if you need a not-ugly surge protector that also multiplies outlets and handles charging of two hungry devices, this one is great.I'm planning to buy another one for my home office with my own money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31VKRIZ04LUJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZKSX0Y0#wasThisHelpful","R31VKRIZ04LUJQ","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So what is your goal in visiting San Francisco, the Bay Area and the wine country?  Presumably to find vineyards and drive around to things inaccessible without a car, given that you're looking at a book of road trips, which does a decent job of laying out road trips.However, the definition of Bay Area is pretty limited, though probably apt for people heading to the wine country.  San Francisco itself is very lightly covered, and I'm not really sure why they put it in the book given that there are other more complete sources of SF information and that driving around the city is more pain than pleasure.  If I were queen of the universe or at least in charge of Lonely Planet I would have left out the brief coverage of the city itself and put in more thorough coverage of everything else.On the good side, they do cover Muir Woods which is glorious and (essentially) accessible only by car.  The map is usable, and there is not an overwhelming amount of choice for any one area.  This last may be a fault too; more varied choices would be welcome.  But this is a brief packable guide, not a comprehensive one.So if this book fits your need for a compact but reasonably authoritative guide to a few good road trips in Northern California, you'll do okay with this.  If you really want something more comprehensive, stay away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YHJF2S9BIM8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743607059#wasThisHelpful","R2YHJF2S9BIM8O","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Feet of Clay is perhaps not the very best Pratchett, but marvelous nontheless.  Written years before his Alzheimer's began to affect the depth and breadth of his writing.Here he takes on his version of the Jewish legend of the Golem, a huge and tireless worker created from clay.  As usual with Pratchett there are political undertones - a Golem's rights movement, essentially, springs up in Ankh-Morpork.  The Golems start to act a bit strange, holding meetings at which the human world thinks they must be up to no good.  So the Golems' activities are controlled by ""the words in their heads""?  Even though theirs are on a strip of paper and ours are more abstract, aren't we controlled by the same thing?This is the only Pratchett to have anything close to specific Jewish content, so if your synagogue book club is looking for an interesting novel of ideas that will definitely support a lively discussion, consider Feet of Clay.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ICJW8ZHKTT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TU16OU#wasThisHelpful","R34ICJW8ZHKTT8","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jeffrey Buller has been an executive and a change leader in higher education, before he became a consultant in educational leadership.  In this useful, practical, and inspiring book he presents the case for productive change processes in education, with examples as well as methods for transformative change.  ""Change"" can mean anything, from lengthy and pointless strategic planning exercises to practical and effective reconsiderations of organizational structure and processes and policies.  Long ago when I worked at a university (staff, not faculty) I was press-ganged into participating in one of those strategic planning things, and I agree entirely with Buller's takedown of the whole thing.  Months of effort resulting in a lot of turf defense and meaningless reports.He both describes usable processes for leading real change, and talks about the ways in which leadership itself must change.  Unlike many consultants, whose books are vague and full of promises, this one gives you enough real and actionable material that you may not need an outside change leader like Buller.Other reviewers have explained more of the specific content; I'm content to recommend the book highly - for anyone on higher education staff or faculty or anyone involved in attempts to create transformative change there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z6BTM18HJ7ZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118762037#wasThisHelpful","R2Z6BTM18HJ7ZM","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Never mind whether the cloud is a fad or a fantasy or the actual next savior of IT for businesses and organizations.  Enterprise IT (the data center in the basement with offsite storage and maybe a hosted web presence and a few outsourced apps or services) is so 2010.If you are a business or IT executive tasked with figuring out how to move your organization to cloud computing, or if you are an analyst or consultant preparing strategies for others, this is the book you need to figure out your cloud computing strategy and go a long way toward implementing that strategy.  It's just technical enough for that purpose, and will certainly equip you to understand and evaluate what vendors are trying to sell you.  He even acknowledges that the old data center and dumb terminal model is not that different from cloud computing in concept.Bond defines the basics, then works through the process from planning through operational and application transformation (separate processes!), deployment, billing, security, management, etc.  In each area there are use cases, scenarios, tools, checklists, lessons learned, and concrete, actionable advice.  If you take away nothing else from this book, the advice not to write your own cloud management tool is golden.You can read a zillion biased white papers, you can hire a cloud consultant, or you can read this book and get the advice and understanding you need.

"This is Elizabeth Gilbert's first self-help book (or her second, if you count Eat, Pray, Love as some of its readers seem to do), and it is excellent.  Gilbert sets out to debunk some of the big misconceptions about the creative life, such as the tormented artist and the drama that supposedly goes with and supports creativity, and that it's better to be a noble failure than to produce actual creative work.  She doesn't want to take away a bit of the magic.  In fact, as her title says, she presents creativity as a kind of big magic.  Your creative idea or project is inside you, and wants to be expressed by you.  If you don't take heed, the idea will eventually move on to someone else.  Creativity isn't limited to what we usually call art; Gilbert considers any activity involving skill and giving joy as creative work, including the pursuit of figure skating in middle age.Gilbert sensibly identifies perfectionism as a kind of fear - why does it matter if your work is not perfect?  Better that it be complete than that it await perfection. Your creativity need not support you in the world.  That's not its responsibility.  You might think that's easy for Gilbert to say, and she does acknowledge the great good luck she's had with her big bestseller.  But that was preceded by years of day jobs and squeezing her writing in the time left from other things.The book is genuinely inspiring, contains both good advice and good stories, and avoids the usual cliches around creativity.

"Linda Gregerson is one of those poets who is deeply respected by a lot of other poets and less well known to the public, even to the public of poetry readers.  This is her first volume of selected poems, and it is intelligently structured with 10 new poems and about 10 poems each from her previous collections.  This lets readers compare the poems from before she found her preferred stanza to the many that came afterward.Gregerson writes for people who can catch allusions to The Great Books and who can pick up other hints as well.  Her last few books are set in an open stanza with the lines indented and broken in a manner that is her own - the long lines are a bit like CK Williams.  Unlike so many recent poets, she has and uses an ear and she has and uses a facility for language - lots of the lines are just plain lovely.  Many poems include little puzzles of the ""do you know what I am referring to"" variety, but none seem to be there just for fun or to trick the reader.  Instead, I found my mind and memory stretched.Most of the work has an emotional core, and she follows the injunction one of my poet friends once passed to me:  if you write about common experiences or emotions, couch them in unusual terms.  There is illness and loss here, along with love and other emotions, and lots of consideration of visual arts.The only way to tell if you'll enjoy Gregerson and meet her challenges to the reader is to look at a few of the poem - the ones Amazon includes on this page are representative of her best.  She's no Billy Collins or Mary Oliver, whose meaning is easy to grasp and whose pleasures are immediate.  But the rewards are high if you are equipped to stay the course.  Just don't ask me whether these are lyrical, descriptive, or meditative poems - none of those categories quite fits.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QA4LF36IKABJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544301676#wasThisHelpful","R3QA4LF36IKABJ","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Agatha Christie wrote a lot of mysteries where the method was poison.  Poison wasn't all that easy to get, and the effects of poison aren't usually the instant death we see on TV.  Kathryn Harkup has put together a compendium of poisons known to Christie, with a description of the use, effects, place in the pharmacopia, ease of obtaining, and so on.  With notes relating each poison to the Christie book(s) where it was used.Some interesting points:  there are more chemists and scientists and druggists than you might expect in Christie's books, reflecting the ways poison could be obtained then and throwing more people under suspicion.  Christie made some large and small mistakes about poisons, some of which seem deliberate.You won't learn how to poison people from this book (whew) - the Internet is your best source there.  Just don't search from your home computer, or hide your IP address when you do and clear your search history.  There isn't as much Christie as one might hope.  The writing is serviceable.  The alphabetic organization prevents more general discussion, I think.This seemed like a golden idea to me - Christie is popular and important, and people love the idea of poison.  If you're a Christie buff you'll want to read this.  If you are interested in forensics generally or even in poisons specifically, there are better sources.

"This is the third book in the Science of Discworld series, which might more properly be called something else since the science relates to Roundworld, not Discworld.  The conceit is that Roundworld is a wizardly science experiment gone wrong, and that it exists inside the Unseen University.  The wizards feel responsible enough to keep intervening in Roundworld's history.  Each book in the series is set in alternating chapters, one carrying a vintage Pratchett story of how the wizards fix something with the aid of Hex, and the other set carrying pretty good popular science.It's clear to me that Pratchett himself wrote the story chapters - the voice is right and there are some true Pratchett touches (see page 207 for one example).  His concern with story and with what runs the world shows up here.  Rincewind, Stibbons, and the Chancellor all behave consistently with their portrayals elsewhere, and the wizards are still concerned mainly with food and with exerting as little effort as possible.  The portrayal of Darwin, especially Darwin attempting to figure out what he is doing on a chair talking to people who aren't quite people, is vintage Pratchett.The popular science ranges further than you might suspect, covering not just the origins of evolution as a theory but also how discoveries and inventions get made.  Cohen and Stewart are both good writers, but they do go on a bit too long.Obviously this is not the best introduction to Pratchett, but if you are interested in science and you enjoy Pratchett, you'll like this.  Just be sure what you're getting.  At this late date, when there wil be no more fresh Discworld material, it's a pleasure to read a full-bore Pratchett story.  Much more actual Pratchett here than in the miserable Long Earth series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IAPNMGU3SS3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804168989#wasThisHelpful","R1IAPNMGU3SS3P","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Small enough for my small hands to hold and manipulate easily.  It has the standard concentrator and diverter accessories, which I don't use but you might.  Not meant as a travel dryer, but smaller than many.So:  does the job just fine, nothing special but decently balanced and not too heavy.  Good value for the Amazon price, and attractive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22VV322XQSXBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRN7SB8#wasThisHelpful","R22VV322XQSXBR","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a gem.  Michelson specializes in helping people get good medical care in serious or challenging illness, but his advice and strategies make sense for routine medical care as well.  Many patients are so used to doing what the doctor says that they don't take charge of their own care -and thus get overtreated, ignored, or otherwise get less than the best outcome and care.Michelson blends persoanal and individual stories with an excellent set of steps and strategies for getting the best care.  Speaking up for yourself, selecting a good doctor, coordinating your care, doing research that your doctor might not have time to do, being a collaborator with the doctor and an advocate for yourself, and so on.  And having someone else as your quarterback, the person who coordinates things and advocates for you.  And, perhaps most important, ways to make yourself seem like a person rather than a case when you're in the hospital.Much of what Michelson recommends is essentially assertiveness, and he includes what amount to scripts for handling potentially awkward conversations with medical people.  So - practical information, inspiration, and personal stories that illustrate and inspire.If you are facing a health crisis or serious chronic condition in yourself or in someone close to you, read this book and put the steps and actions into practice.  It really could save your life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N3PMZB8XJ6MQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038535228X#wasThisHelpful","R3N3PMZB8XJ6MQ","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a compact manual burr grinder that has some good features - a detachable handle so it can be stored compactly, and an infinitely adjustable grind setting and a brush that helps clean it well.  Like all manual grinders it is quiet.  Takes maybe two minutes to grind enough for a single large mug of drip coffee.Which is exactly what I need so I can have freshly ground coffee at the office.  For me the grind has been reasonably consistent, with not too much dust.  I'm not sure how durable the grinding surface will turn out to be, but for my purposes this little grinder is close to perfect.One caution:  be careful when you take it apart or put it back together; the metal edge of the top compartment is sharp and you can cut yourself on it if you're clumsy enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1159L9SYG5KFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE40XE0#wasThisHelpful","R1159L9SYG5KFH","A1L0SUHFS9LHPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L0SUHFS9LHPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

All exhibit his characteristic skill, many are less complex in structure and language than some of his novel-length work.If you've like any of Mieville's previous work you'll find something to like here, and you will probably find your horizons widened.

"The amount of criticism that surrounded this series when it was first announced/published was really nothing short of shocking and a lot of it continues to this day. Between the people that hated the idea of a female Thor and the people that said it had poor writing....well, lets just say that positive statements were few and far between. What made this even more shocking is that I read the series from the start and thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought Jason Aaros writing was great and I personally loved the idea of a female Thor. Its nice to switch things up from time to time and take LONG running series in complete new and bold directions. In my opinion, comic sales in general would be doing much better if companies were far more open to taking these kinds of bold risks as they can really introduce new life into a lot of the long running series out there.I am a big fan of Thor and own a large amount of his comics and this was honestly like a breath of fresh air. I liked it so much I purchased the hard cover versions even tho I already own all of the comics. I normally do that sort of thing with series I really like. The bottom line - if your a fan of Thor and you haven't read this series yet, do yourself a favor and give it a shot and judge the title for yourself. Don't listen to all the negativity surrounding this title. Just go in with a clear open mind, without any preconceived notions, and I have no doubt that a lot of people out there will really love this series.One of the best aspects of the series is the mystery surrounding who this Thor really is and the series cleverly puts clues here and there along the way. One of the reviews I read a awhile back (can't remember who it or where I read it) really summed it up best, it said something along the lines of this arc being half-mystery and half-rookie-adventure. It really is a great description. If your planning on reading this and don't already know Thor's identity, don't go and look it up, regardless of how tempted you may be. You will ultimately wind up taking away the one of the single best aspects to this series, the mystery regarding who she really is.So to sum this up, I for one really enjoyed this series and I sincerely hope that this isn't the last we have seen of this character. I really hope that this series will inspire other companies and even Marvel to take more bold risks like this. If your a fan of Thor, you at least owe it to yourself to give this series a shot and to do so with an open mind.4 Stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QCJ6FUMV66AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785192387#wasThisHelpful","R3QCJ6FUMV66AH","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my opinion, Mark Texiera is one of the more underrated comic artists of this generation. In particular his depictions of Vampirella are some of my favorite the last 10-15 tears running. Unfortunately, this book does not do a very good job in regards to the overall selection of artwork shown. Don't get me wrong, there is some great artwork in here, but ultimately there is a lot of questionable artwork included here as well. That woundn't have bothered me so much if it weren't for the fact that those images wound up being selected over much better images. if this was some huge compendium of all of his best work, then I would be ok with it, but that is not the case. What you ultimately wind up with is one of the more mediocre art books I have seen in a very long time, especially comic related.All that being said, I have seen this book discounted heavily on multiple occasions. I don't think Amazon allows people to post the prices they paid for items so I will just say that I wound up paying very little for this book overall so even tho I consider it a mediocre art book, I am content with my purchase simply due to the fact that I paid so little for it. In fact, the price I paid for this book was one of the cheapest prices I have ever paid for an art book before. So my advice would be to keep an eye on the pricing and if you get an opportunity to buy it for a really great price, go ahead and do so. Its definitely worth it if you can get it cheap. That is really the only way I can recommend buying this book. The art book market for comic art is absolutely overflowing with amazing books so its hard giving this a recommendation with so many better books out there. So again, if your a big Texeira fan, only buy this if you can get a really good deal on it. Otherwise, I have to recommend passing altogether.2 Stars!","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EN23C4C65461/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934331112#wasThisHelpful","R1EN23C4C65461","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First and foremost, calling these posters is really a bit of a stretch. Traditionally, posters are printed on a very thin paper stock and these are printed on a much thicker paper stock. This should really be called Mass Effect: The Print Collection but thats just nitpicking. Regardless of what its called, the end result is really just a great collection of Mass Effect artwork. While the artwork itself is definitely much smaller (12""x16"") than the Mass Effect prints that Bioware released through Treehouse Stores, this releases allows you to buy 20 prints for roughly 1/10th to 1/20th the cost of a single art print from Bioware as those prints now run anywhere from $100 to $300+, depending on the print. So this is a great way to get some really nice Mass Effect artwork for very little money and the best part about the thicker print stock is it allows you to display them on their own, just by leaning them up against something, although if you want to matt and frame them, that is certainly an option.All in all, I have become a big fan of these Poster collections.  I also own the Assassins Creed Poster Collection, The Halo Poster Collection, Gears of War Poster Collection, and The Elder Scrolls Online Poster Collection. Some of the other releases had 40 posters as opposed to 20, but even with just 20 posters, this is still just a killer deal. Honestly, if your looking for gaming art that doesn't cost a significant amount of money, then these poster collections are just a great option and if your a fan of Mass Effect Art then this purchase should be a no brainer.5 Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SLIM7WZEY1O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616557427#wasThisHelpful","R2SLIM7WZEY1O5","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really can't say enough good things about this piece. Just when you think Kotobukiya couldn't get any better, they release a statue like this. It really is brilliant in every possible way. First and foremost, I absolutely love the color. Its like a cross between a metallic red and magenta and that glossy metallic paint that Kotobukiya uses really adds an extra oomph of visual flair. Then you have the pose, which is both dynamic yet subtle and it definitely has that feminine touch, which you absolutely want with a piece like this. As for the hair, its actually one of my favorite aspects with this piece. Kotobukiya can definitely go a bit overboard at times with the crazy hair, but the hair on this piece really finds the perfect balance. Its crazy, but not overtly so and the replacement hair looks just as amazing. Last but not least, you have one of the best faces I have seen yet in this line of statues. While I definitely prefer these statues with the masks on, this is one statue I would seriously consider displaying without the mask. I will probably wind up alternating, just to mix it up from time to time.The bottom line - Kotobukiya has really outdone themselves this time around. They have produced what is arguably the nicest statue yet in this series. I can't speak for others, but this is definitely my favorite statue up to this point. The colors are amazing, the paint job is spot on, it has a beautiful pose and the hair and face are absolutely perfect. Even if I could, I wouldn't change a single thing with this statue. Just an absolutely brilliant job all the way around. Kotobukiya is without question one of the premier statue companies on the market and the fact that they continually raise the bar higher and higher....well, its a real testament to the overall quality of the company. If I could give this statue 6 stars, I would. Again, just absolutely brilliant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZMGIXQIASN4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJ170ZQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ZMGIXQIASN4O","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I openly admit, I use Itoya's Profolio Professional line almost exclusively for prints that are 13x19 and smaller. Unfortunately, Itoya doesn't make an 18x24 version in the Profolio Professional line. Itoya does offer an 18x24 in some of their other lines, but those options are below the level of quality I look for with portfolios and presentation cases. Hence I needed to go outside Itoya for my 18x24 prints. I tried quite a few different models, from a handful of different companies, and was never really fully content with the overall cost and quality....well, that is until I tried Prat's Start 4 Presentation Case. Make no mistake about it, the Start 4 is one of the highest quality portfolio's on the market.First and foremost, the cover is made with real high quality leather. The cover is soft, has a beautiful appearance, and the seam work is just top notch. I have never been a fan of hard polypropylene covers as they just look cheap and feel cheap in your hands. Nice leather covers on the other hand, like this cover, are just a real pleasure to hold and look through. Not only does the leather give a beautiful appearance, it's also extremely comfortable to hold and look through. The cover is also slightly padded, which just adds to the overall comfort of holding the portfolio and looking through the artwork contained within. Basically, you get a sense of the overall quality of this presentation case just from picking it up and touching it.The Interior is just as nice as the exterior. The internal ring mechanism is extremely high in quality and the pages are very similar to Itoya's Polyglass pages, which are some of the highest quality pages on the market. It comes with 10 pages to start with (20 prints) and additional pages can be purchased in packs of 5 or 10. According to Prat, this presentation case is rated to hold up to 30 sheets (60 prints), but personally, I never go above 50 prints per portfolio or 25 pages, especially for larger cases/portfolios like 18x24. They just get too heavy and unwieldy. My advice would be to see what the portfolio is like with 25 filled pages (50 prints) before adding another 5 pages (10 prints). I now own 3 of these cases and 25 pages is the perfect amount in my opinion. Of course, others might feel differently on the matter so again, I would recommend filling it with 50 prints and then decide whether to add an additional 10 prints. This case is also fitted with an internal elastic band, which is a feature lacking from a lot of presentation cases. It keeps the pages in place while stored. Unless its stored flat, larger pages can actually begin to sag and droop over the years. the elastic band prevents that from happening.Overall, the Start 4 is definitely one of the more expensive options on the market, but that is because its one of the highest quality options on the market. You get what you pay for and the Start 4 is definitely worth every last penny! I am both a professional photographer and an avid print collector and the single best advice I can give to people is not to skimp on the storage side. At just $50-$100 per print, your looking at an overall value of $2500 to $5000, with a full 50 print portfolio. With that in mind, ask yourself if spending $150-$200 is really too much when your storing that kind of value in it? The $150-$200 price point only adds around $3 to $4 to the cost of each print. Personally, I just couldn't imagine putting that kind of value into a cheap $50 portfolio. Again, the best advice I can give is to buy a quality portfolio/presentation case like the Start 4. Not only will it protect your prints better, but it also makes looking through your prints a more enjoyable experience.Bottom line - They say you can't judge a book by its cover, but this is one of the rare cases where that just isn't the case as this is one book that definitely can be judged by the cover. The Start 4 is a very high quality/high end presentation case. Everything about it just screams quality. Its become my go to presentation case for 18x24 prints. If your looking for a high end presentation case...this is definitely one of the best options on the market. Its definitely pricer than your average presentation case, but its worth every lasts penny and then some.5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X7IV098K2OT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001IHNGEG#wasThisHelpful","R2X7IV098K2OT9","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own a really large cloth covered tool bag from Stanley that I use to store all of my extra cords. It literally weighs like 30 pounds and is absolutely chock full of every cord imaginable. RCA cables, audio cables, coaxial cables, HDMI cables, adaptors, speaker wire, Apple microphones, various power cords, charging cables, external hard Drive cords, old school VCR cables, and the list goes on and on and on. Honestly I don't think there is a single audio/video cord in existence that isn't in that bag. there are actually cords in there that I have no clue what they go to.Anyways, I haven't used my various iPods in a long time, at least 10-12 months, so when I finally decided to pull them out and start using them agin, I was at a complete loss as I couldn't find my various iPod charging cords. I decided to look in that bag and while I was at it, get rid of an many cords as possible. For example, I must have had at least 15+ RCA cords which I received when buying various DVD players throughout the years. Unfortuantely, most of the cords in that case are literally brand new. So I decided to give all the old/used cords to the Salvation Army and kept most of the brand new cords for myself, even tho I will probably never use the vast majority of them. Anyways,  I finally stumbled onto the bulk of my iPod charging cords, but unfortunately they were in really bad shape. I don't know what chemical's Apple used in their old cords, but whatever they used, it had started to break down the rubber coating. they were just super sticky, as if someone had poured a light layer of syrup on them and then let them dry. I immediately got on Amazon and order replacement cords for all of my iPods.One of the cords I purchased was the [Apple MFi Certified] Stalion cable and I was definitely impressed. It really feels like a high quality cord and best of all, the exterior rubber coating is really soft, which makes rolling the cord up incredibly easy. I have been using it for a few weeks now and have absolutely zero complaints. If your looking for charging cord for your iPod, Stalion cords are definitely one of the nicer option. Not to mention the cords were pretty inexpensive. I just hope the same thing doesn't happen with these cords.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FLDKCNKI2HQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSURE1E#wasThisHelpful","R1FLDKCNKI2HQ1","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alan Moore's Batman: the Killing Joke is easily one of my favorite comic stories of all time. Its definitely a bit darker than most comic fare, but that is exactly why its become so hugely popular. I won't give any spoilers away, just in case there are comic readers out there that still haven't read it. that being said, if your a fan of Batman and the Joker.....well you should consider this an absolute must buy. I already own the comics in which this story played out, but when I discovered they had a hard cover edition on sale, it took me all of 60 seconds to order a copy. As much as I enjoy collecting regular comics, there is just nothing like a nice hard cover!Again, if your a Batman/Joker fan and haven't already read this story....well, it really should be the very next book you buy. this is really about as good as storytelling gets in comics.

"I am a bit late to the game when it comes to Kotobukiya's Bishoujo line, but this is definitely a case of better late than never as these statues are without a doubt some of the more unique super hero statues on the market. One of my favorite aspects to these statues is that most of them have very dynamic poses. I have never been a fan of statues that have the character just standing there in a basic pose. the more dynamic the better in my book and Koto certainly doesn't disappoint in this regard. One of my favorite comic artists of all time is the late Michael Turner and one of the main reasons is due to the kinetic energy most of his artwork contained. Characters literally feel like they are about to jump right off the page. A perfect example is Michael Turner's Ms. Marvel #1 variant cover. She really feels like she's about to jump right off the cover. Well, the same can be said of Kotobukia's Bishoujo line. They all appear to be right in the middle of some dynamic motion/action which really makes them some of the more exciting statues on the market. This effect is really multiplied by the crazy hair styles that Kotobukiya normally uses. Spider-Woman and Starfire are perfect examples of the crazy Koto hair. It really reinforces that kinetic energy and movement that these statues possess.Another aspect of these statues that I love is the paint that Koto uses. Not only are their paint jobs always top notch, they also use a lot of shiny and metallic paints which ultimately add just an extra oomph of visual flair. Spider-Woman is a perfect example as the shiny red paint on her costume just pops and looks absolutely amazing. If you were to replace that paint with some normal dull red paint, the end result just would't be the same. Another great example is the recent Batwoman statue. the shiny/metallic paint on that piece really makes all the difference in the world.If I have one complaint about Kotobukiya's Bishoujo line, it would be that their not limited editions. While they do offer certain variants of particular statues, usually at shows like the San Diego Comic Con, which are limited editions. the basic line itself is not limited. As a longtime collector of both Sideshow statues and limited edition prints/lithographs, there is just something about limited editions that I find extremely appealing. A lot of that has to do with knowing exactly how many pieces exist out in the world. If I had the choice between an open edition and a limited edition which cost a little bit more money, I would take the limited edition each and every time. I sincerely hope that Kotobukiya changes this aspect of the line and starts making them limited editions. Of course, the main benefit to open editions is the company can produce as many as they want, but that really doesn't change with limited editions as all the company has to do is make a small change to statue (usually dealing with color), and they can just as easily produce a 2nd edition of the same exact statue. They can really make as many editions as they want, so long as some aspect of the statue is changed, to distinguish it from the other editions. So producing limited editions by no means limits Koto to producing just a set amount, which makes thier choice to go with open editions a bit confusing, especially given how popular limited editions are today.Anyways, even with this line being mostly open edition, Kotobukiya's Bishoujo line is again, one of the more unique lines of super hero statues currently on the market and considering I mainly focus on female super heroes, both with comics and statues, its a line that is literally right up my alley. The Spider Woman statue is a bit smaller than their other statues, but that is only due to her crouching down pose, which is actually one of my favorite aspects to this statue. Its a perfect pose for this character.Bottom line - Between the beautiful paint job, the amazing colors, the dynamic pose, and her crazy flowing hair....well, they all add up to one amazing Spider Woman Statue. In my opinion, the Bishoujo line is not only one of the more unique statue lines on the market, but its also one of the more entertaining statue lines on the market. They really are just a joy to look at and Spider Woman certainly doesn't disappoint in this regard. All in all, Kotobukiya did an amazing job on Spider Woman and no Bishoujo collector should be without it.5 Stars!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRSI5VIQDPCRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOXYOM2#wasThisHelpful","RRSI5VIQDPCRJ","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will openly admit, Neil Degrasse Tyson is no Carl Sagan. The original Cosmos was one of the single greatest series every produced for television and a large part of that was due to Carl Sagan. He was just an exceptional speaker and his excitement for astronomy was infectious. That opening 15 minutes of the first episode was simply breathtaking. Here are 2 of my favorite statements made during that opening:The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a great height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.""in a ship of the imagination, unfettered by ordinary limits of speed and size, drawn by the music of cosmic harmonies. It can take us anywhere in space and time. Perfect as a snowflake, organic as a dandelion seed, it will carry us to worlds of dreams and worlds of facts. Come with me. . . .""It wasn't the background or some amazing CGI that made that opening so powerful, it was Carl Sagan's passion and his ability to convey that passion though his incredible speaking ability. I am a HUGE fan of Neil Degrasse Tyson, but he just doesn't convey that same sense of passion that Sagan did. He has a much more monotone method of speaking so you really didn't get that same level of passion or excitement that the original series gave you.That being said, this updated version of Cosmos was still brilliant and Neil Degrasse Tyson did a great job with the series. We have learned so much more since the original Cosmos aired so there was a legitimate need for this updated version. This series was just hugely entertaining, incredibly interesting, and the updated graphics/CGI were absolutely mind bending. These kinds of programs get kids interested in astronomy and this updated version of Cosmos was just a massive success all the way around. The people behind this series, many of which were behind the original series, should be very proud of their accomplishment. Just an outstanding job all the way around.The bottom line - I immediately purchased this as soon as it was made available and have watched it multiple times since then. I am a space junkie and an amateur backyard astronomer and I can never get enough quality space documentaries. This really is a brilliant series all the way around and I can't possibly give it a higher recommendation. I know Sagan would have been 100% satisfied with this updated version and that is really the best compliment I can give this series. In all honesty, this series should be part of every public schools science curriculum. Yes, its that good!5 Stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBATSXYOPS2VX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWULSTC#wasThisHelpful","RBATSXYOPS2VX","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been collecting art books for well over 10+ years and gaming is definitely one of my favorite genre's for art books, probably due to the fact that gaming has played such a large role in my life. Unfortunately, many of the art books released in this genre are really mediocre at best, especially the smaller art books that get included with many special edition games. I really wish the gaming market in general would become far more serious about the overall quality of these books. That being said, there have been a small handful of releases that have been exemplary in every way possible and The Art of Blizzard Entertainment sits at the top of that small handful. this art book is epic in every sense of the word.First and foremost, the book itself measures roughly 10x13, which is bit larger than most gaming art books. That of course is a very good thing! If there is any market where the saying ""the bigger the better"" holds true, its the art market (books, prints, etc.) and this book certainly doesn't disappoint in this regard. When you combine the overall size and the overall length, which is 376 pages....well, you ultimately wind up with one massive tome dedicated to Blizzard's artwork for Diablo, Starcraft, and Warcraft. It should really come as no surprise to Blizzard fans that they have some of the most talented artists in the entire gaming industry. Their in game cinematics have continually pushed the boundaries for in game cut scenes and are renowned the world over. I still watch the original World of Warcraft video from time to time and even 10+ years after initially seeing it....well, its still as breathtaking today as it was when it was first released.Again, the titles covered in this art book are Blizzards 3 main IP's, those being Diablo, Starcraft, and Warcraft. For those familiar with these games, you know there is just a massive amount of artwork with which to choose from with these series and thankfully, Blizzard did an absolutely brilliant job choosing which artwork to include in this book. For those that have purchased previous art books, you will recognize a lot of artwork from previous books, but don't let that deter you as there is also a lot of new content in here, enough to make this a worthwhile purchase even for people that purchased previous art books. One could really think of this as the definitive edition. If you really have a problem with this, I would recommend selling your older copies and buying this version.The book Itself is really quite beautiful. It has a nice quality cover and binding and the paper is actually nicer than I was expecting. Its just a quality art book all the way around. I really like the cover picture as well. They could have easily gone which a much more dynamic piece for the cover, but I actually really like this more basic approach. In my opinion, it really is a perfect cover piece. I usually put more stock in covers than I should, but thats just how I am. I just love beautiful covers and this one certainly doesn't disappoint. All in all, there are over 700 pieces of art in here including paintings, concept pieces and sketches. It also has invaluable insight and commentary by Nick Carpenter, Sam Didier, and Chris Metzenary all of whom have played an important role in making Blizzard the studio it is today.The bottom line - The Art of Blizzard Entertainment is without question one of the best video game related art books I have ever purchased. Its just massive in scope and is definitely the one Blizzard art book you don't want to miss. Its chock full of beautiful paintings, sketches and concept work and has extremely entertaining insight from the people that have made Blizzard what it is today. Again, if owning previous volumes bothers you, due to much of the same artwork being used, sell your previous books and buy this one. I myself own all of the previous art books and while those are still amazing in their own right, this book trumps them all. If your a Blizzard fan, an art book fan, or just an avid gamer that enjoys looking at amazing video game artwork, you really owe it to yourself to add this to your collection. This is really the pinnacle of video game art books. It simply doesn't get any better than this.5 Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35DKOBG8MQASM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608870278#wasThisHelpful","R35DKOBG8MQASM","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a box of these caramels as a gift when Sanders first introduced them like 5 years back. I am an AVID Sanders fan so my family normally sends me Sanders gifts during the holidays. I actually remember very clearly the first instance I tried these caramels. I opened up the box and was absolutely blown away at how amazing the salt was when paired with Caramel. I had never had sea salt caramels before, or any type of salted chocolate. The box was literally gone by that evening and these caramels have become a staple in my house ever since.I am very fortunate as I live in the metro Detroit area so Sanders products are very easy to find. The grocery store that we go to actually sells these caramels, both in boxes and individually wrapped singles. The CostCo. by me also carries them, but only the dark chocolate version. While I do enjoy the dark chocolate version, Its just not as good as the milk chocolate. In all honesty, these are the kinds of candies you really have to be careful with as they are so good that you can wind up eating too many, thus giving yourself one serious stomach ache!!Sanders was literally on the verge of going out of business back in the late 90's and early 00's, that is until Morley Candy swept in and purchased Sanders back in 2002. At that point, all of the Sanders fountain shops had closed and the only products you could really find anymore were the hot fudge products at various grocery stores. Morley has done just a remarkable job bringing Sanders back! There are now 6 fountain shops in the Metro Detroit Area, with more being planned, and the Sanders product line is significantly larger than it has ever been before. One of their best lines is called the Woodward Collection. The Sea Salt Caramels belong to this line of products. It also includes Dark or Milk Chocolate Cherry Cordials, Butter Almond Toffee, Milk Chocolate Cashews, Cherry Almond or Pecan Torties, Caramels with Drizzle, and of course Milk or Dark Chocolate Sea Salt Caramels. The Sea Salt Caramels are definitely my favorite, but this entire line of products is absolutely amazing!!Bottom line - Sanders is back in a big way and their line of products has been expanded dramatically in recent years. Sea Salt Caramels are one of their newer products and make no mistake about it, they are well deserving of the Sanders name. The caramel is rich and gooey (not a firm caramel) and the salt just adds a perfect kick to the overall taste. Sea salt chocolates and caramels have actually become very popular in the candy market these last few years and I have tried my fair share of them. That said, none of them come close to matching Sanders Sea Salt Caramels. Wether your a caramel lover, a chocolate lover, or just a candy lover in general, you really owe it to yourself to order a box or two. This is about as good as candy gets!!5 Stars!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23IYF7BKZJ9A9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FK49EX0#wasThisHelpful","R23IYF7BKZJ9A9","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The art of Red Sonja is an art book from Dynamite that is really right in line with their other art books like the Art of Vampirella and the Art of Dejah Thoris. You get a basic intro at the beginning of the book, which goes on to explain how the character first started. Its short, but I actually enjoyed this aspect of the book as I wasn't familiar with how Red Sonja got started. From there, it jumps right into the artwork and overall, its a decent selection of Red Sonja work. Like Dejah Thoris and Vampirella, Red Sonja really seems to bring out the best in a lot of artists that depict her. Some of the artists in this book include Alex Ross, Jim Lee, Adam Hughes, Frank Cho, Art Adams, Mel Rubi, Frank Brunner, Pablo Marcos, and John Cassaday.While there is a lot of great work here, there are ultimately some selections that I just didn't agree with simply due to the fact that there are a lot of better choices that they could have chosen. Of course this is purely subjective so others might disagree completely. Don't get me wrong, there is still a lot of quality work here, but there are also some selections that just shouldn't have made the cut and that is ultimately why I gave it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating.The quality of the book is right in line with Dynamites other art books. It has a quality binding, mid-level quality paper, which is really what you should expect from all of the art books in this price range, and a nice quality glossy cover. Dynamite does not disappoint in this regard. For the price, your getting a quality art book that will last a long time if properly taken care of.Bottom line - While its definitely not Dynamites best art book, its still a quality art book and a must buy if your a big fan of Red Sonja. There is some questionable work in here, but is quickly overshadowed by the quality pieces in this book, and there are definitely some amazing pieces of art in this book. Red Sonja is just one of those characters that seems to inspire the best out of the artists that depict her. By the time you get through this book, you will be thankful you bought it!4 stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14JCIBDANJHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606900668#wasThisHelpful","R14JCIBDANJHX","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To start this off, I will openly admit that I am not a fan of motion controlled gaming. Maybe its because I have been gaming for 30+ years with some sort of controller in my hand. Whatever the reason, I just vastly prefer a controller in my hand as opposed to motion controls. That being said, I absolutely LOVE what Kinect bring to the Xbox One console outside of motion controlled gaming.My single favorite feature that Kinect brings to the console is without question Skype. I have a cousin who lives down in Florida and we play online games together at least 3-4 times a week. We actually grew up together in Michigan and we were both video game nuts back in the day. I still remember the all nighters we used to pull playing games like Karateka and the Sierra and LucasArts adventure games. Unfortunately, he moved down to Florida with his parents when I was roughly 13. As soon as Xbox Live went live back with the original Xbox, we started playing games together online. We both enjoy the same types of games so its just really great being able to play games with him even tho is he almost 1000 miles away. Anyways, we both purchased an Xbox One at launch and decided to give Skype a go. All you do is start Skype up and snap it to the edge of the frame and your good to go. The difference was truly amazing. As nice as it was playing online together, being able to see each other while playing was just amazing. Being able to see each others reactions to whats occurring in game really does make it just a vastly superior experience overall. A lot of times, well just pause the game for 5-10 minutes and just catch up with each other. Ultimately, Skype is just a FAR more personal experience than regular online gaming and after 6+ months of using this feature....well, I simply couldn't imagine going back to the way things used to be without Skype. It truly raises the overall experience a couple of notches.I have also become a big fan of the voice controls that Kinect enable. Being able to walk into the room and say ""Xbox On"", and then being able to direct Xbox One to the game I want to play, even before I am am sitting down and have the controller in hand is just really convenient. Its a bit weird talking to your console at first, but give it a week or two and it becomes as natural as pressing buttons. Not only is it really convenient, its also faster than using a controller. Another big plus is Kinect being able to automatically recognize each user and automatically selecting the console settings for that particular user.Last but not least, I purchased the Master Chief Collection a few weeks back and inside that game was a redemption card for the Halo TV Series, Nightfall. There was a code that you could enter or there was a big scan code on the back of the card. I absolutely HATE entering in those kinds of codes using game controllers. Its one of my biggest pet peeves with consoles in general. For some reason, Netflix used to make me sign in every time I visited the site on my Xbox 360 and it was just a total pain having to enter that info time and time again, especial using a game controller. Anyways, I had never used one of those scan codes before so I simply held up the card in front of the Kinect sensor to see if anything would happen. It instantly recognized the code and entered it into my account. I immediately got a message on screen telling me that Nightfall had been added to my account. It took all of 2 seconds and was honestly one of the easiest things I have ever done. This may not be a big deal to some, but for me.....well, I absolutely LOVE the fact that I can use those scan codes now, as opposed to entering those ridiculously long codes using my game controller. I was just in awe at how easy and convenient that whole process was. It really was instantaneous.Its also important to note that this is definitely NOT your Xbox 360 Kinect. The Xbox One Kinect is one hardcore piece of optical equipment. You will recognize that the minute you pick it up and see it with your own eyes. Just to give a few technical specs:1 - 1080p (Original Kinect was 640x480)2 - Global shutter as opposed to a rolling shutter, which reduces motion blu to less than 14ms. 1 ms = 1,000,000th of a second.3 - 60% wider field of view than the original Kinect4 - Minimum distance of 4.5 feet (6 feet with original Kinect)5 - It is capable of processing 2GB of data per second!! Yes, thats correct, 2 GB per second. Crazy!!6 - Both color & infrared sensors7 - 3 IR blasters (3 times the fidelity of the original Kinect)8 - 4 microphonesKinect 2.0 is just a quality piece of equipment, well beyond the capabilities of the Xbox 360 Kinect or any other gaming cameras on the market for that matter. There is a very good reason this sports such a hefty price tag. It truly is a beautiful and extremely high powered camera.I actually purchased a 2nd Xbox One, the White Sunset Overdrive Bundle, and that doesn't come with a Kinect camera. I set that console up in my bedroom and my original Xbox One is set up in my living room. Since the white Xbox One doesn't have a Kinect camera, its given me the opportunity to jump back and forth between my Xbox One that has a Kinect and my Xbox One that doesn't have a Kinect. As beautiful as the white Xbox One is, it just feels empty without a Kinect. In all honesty, it really doesn't even feel like the same console. It only took about a week before I decided I was definitely buying a 2nd Kinect for my white Xbox One. Hopefully MS will release a white Kinect. If they don't, I will simply buy a standard version and spray paint it white.Bottom line - even if your like me and absolutely hate motion control gaming, there are still plenty of reasons why you would want to add a Kinect to your console and I have no doubt that as time goes on, there will only be more reasons for wanting to own one. At least for me, Skype is the only app I need to make Kinect a worthwhile investment. Everything else is just a bonus in my book. Skype has significantly improved my online game sessions with my cousin and again, I just couldn't imagine going back to gaming without it. I was actually one of the people who was legitimately upset with MS that they were making me buy a Kinect with my Xbox One. I owned one for my Xbox 360 and I never used it. I felt like I was spending $100 on something I was never going to use, that is until I actually used it. Now.....well, now I can't imagine an Xbox One without it.5 Stars!!Edit:I wanted to add to this review as I just discovered another very cool voice command with Kinect, the ""Xbox Record that"" command. At any time during your gameplay, you can simply say ""Xbox Record That"" and it will automatically record the previous 15-20 seconds of gameplay. For people that like to upload game clips or highlight clips, its a really cool feature, one that doesn't require any game stoppage at all. You can just continue on playing without interruption. The longer I use Kinect, the more I realize its all about convenience. Sure, you can still do a lot of the things even without Kinect, but it won't be as easy and convenient as the Kinect commands. I really have to give credit to MS on this front. They took Kinect and made it FAR more than just motion controlled gaming. Clearly a lot of thought went into how to make this console as simple and easy to use as possible and having Kinect really makes all the difference in the world on this front. As I said before, I just can't imagine using an Xbox One without it now.I also started using the new HDMI pass-through and I am equally impressed with his feature as well. It basically allows you to run your cable box directly through your Xbox One and one of the benefits to doing this is using the voice control to change channels. In all honesty, I don't watch a lot of TV so I am always having trouble remembering what channels are what, especially with so many channels being available these days. Well, that is no longer a problem as now I can just say the channel and it automatically takes me there. In all honesty, this has become one of my favorite features with this console and I am a bit bummed I didn't take advantage of it sooner. No more remote control, no more list of channels, etc. I just say the channel I want to go to, like National Geographic or ESPN, and it instantly takes me there. This is definitely one of the best voice control features on this console and I HIGHLY recommend people use this feature if they can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5CDULHNVGCK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INAX3Q2#wasThisHelpful","R5CDULHNVGCK7","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We first started using Red Bob like 3-4 years back. Fast forward to today and Red Bob products can be found everywhere in our kitchen. I really have yet to come across a Red Bob product that I don't like. That said, there are definitely a few that stick out above the others and Red Bob's 13 Bean mix is definitely one of them. We initially made this mix plain, just using the beans and Red Bob's seasoning packets. Then my wife mentioned buying a ham bone from Honey Baked Ham and making ham & bean soup using Red Bob's mix. For those unaware, you can buy ham bones from any Honey Baked Ham store. They are already bagged and can be found in the frozen section. There is actually a TON of meat left on those bones, a perfect amount for full bag of Red Bob's 13 Bean MIx.We use a full package of Red Bob's 13 Bean Soup Mix when making our soup as again, its a perfect amount to use with a ham bone from Honey Baked. We just open up a package of Red Bob's 13 Bean Soup Mix, dump it into a large bowl, fill the bowl with water until all of the beans are covered, and let the beans soak overnight. The next day we rinse the beans with water and put them in a large pot. We then add 4 1/2 quarts of water, 2 Tbsp's of Red Bob's Bean Soup Seasoning Mix, and throw in the ham bone from Honey Baked. We bring it to a boil and then simmer for roughly 2 hours. At about the 30 minute mark, we pull the ham bone out of the soup and start cutting the ham off the bone and into small bite sized pieces. At that point, the ham will be tender and very easy to cut. We then put the small pieces of ham and the ham bone back into the soup for the remainder of the cooking time. It smells FANTASTIC when its cooking. When its finally done, we take the ham bone back out, remove any ham that might be left on the bone and throw it away. Using a full package of 13 bean mix does make a pretty big batch of soup. If your making it for just a couple of people, you can always freeze some of it. Thats what we usually do. We have a couple of freezer containers that are perfect for soups. We prefer doing it that way, as opposed to making a smaller batch, as then you have some in the freezer already made up and ready to go. Just pull it out of the freezer and put it in the refrigerator when your ready to eat it. There is no noticeable decline in quality from freezing it.We thoroughly enjoy Red Bob's 13 Bean Soup Mix by itself, but adding a Honey Baked Ham Bone to the soup....well, its really kicks it up a notch! Its absolutely amazing!! If you enjoy bean and ham soup, you really owe it to yourself to give this a try. Its actually hard going back to just the basic 13 bean soup mix once you have had the Honey Baked Ham in there. All in all, this has become one of our favorite soups. Its just super hearty, perfect for the colder months. Total time, around 2 hours once the beans have soaked overnight. Homemade bean or ham/bean soup in just 2 hours....well, whats not to like about that. Definitely one of Red Bob's best products. If your a soup fan or love beans in general, you really can't go wrong with this one.5 Stars and then some!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIHMJDZPQYX8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VDRL7G#wasThisHelpful","RIHMJDZPQYX8Y","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I hate to admit this, but I purchased this game back in September of 2012 and I finally got around to playing it for the first time a few weeks back. Unfortunately, thats one of the downfalls of having such a massive backlog of games, games like this can easily get swallowed up and forgotten. Anyways, in the mood for a flying game, I finally decided to unwrap this baby and finally give it a spin. Now that I have done so, I am in absolute awe that it took me this long to finally play this game. As the title of my review states, its absolutely brilliant!One of the best aspects of this game is its as difficult as you want it to be. It has various difficulty setting which take it all the way from being easy, to extremely challenging, and I do mean challenging!! The amount of content included is really impressive. Most games pale in comparison. There is campiagn, dynamic campaign, tournaments, versus, events and if that wasn't enough, there is an editor that allows you to make your own missions. Again, most games pale in comparison!All that being said, its the game itself that really shines. Its just brilliant with everything that you would expect from a great flight simulator. The combat is tense and exhilarating and the graphics are beautiful. Each of the planes have a unique feel to them and are rendered in amazing detail. Not to mention, the damage modeling has to be seen to be believed.This is honestly the best combat oriented flight game I have ever played, BY FAR!! I honesty can't think of another game that I enjoyed this much.Bottom line - I enjoy writing reviews, but I rarely do so for video games. It really takes an incredible game to motivate me to write a review for it. So the fact that I am even writing this review is a testament to this games quality. The fact that I had this game for over 2 years before actually playing it is a just a crime. This is without question the single best combat flight sim I have ever played on a console, by far. If your looking for a quality combat oriented flight sim....look no further. This is really as good as it gets. I sincerely hope we see a Birds of Steel 2 for Xbox One/PS4 someday soon. It would be a real crime not to have a single sequel for this game.5 stars and then some!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CBHJYSH8CIBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058VI1SO#wasThisHelpful","R2CBHJYSH8CIBQ","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wound up buying Terraria based on a recommendation of a friend. I had initially written it off as some sort of Minecraft clone and to be perfectly honest, I think I am one of the only people in the world that do not really care for Minecraft. I just have a really hard time getting past the low resolution textures and graphics. Anyways, one of my good gaming freinds told me that while it did have similar aspects to it, that of building and resource gathering, it had many aspects that made it very different from Minecraft. I am a big fan of 2D sidescrolling games in general so I decided to take a chance and bought it on Xbox Live Arcade. I basically spent the next week completely immersed in this game.For those unaware, Terraria is basically a 2D sandbox style exploration game. One of the best aspects to Terraria is the world is randomly generated at the start of the game. This type of randomly generated world/dungeon is becoming more and more popular in the gaming world and for good reason. It significantly adds to the replayability of a particular game. Terraria does have many things in common with Minecraft. Like Minecraft, the heart of the game is exploring, collecting materials, and crafting an ever increasing number of items available to you. You start off in the forest, but Terraria has many different biomes with which to explore, each offering unique items with which to craft with. By the time you get 8-10 hours into Terraria, you will already have a large number of items that you can create, including various types of armor and weapons. One of the best items in the game is the rocket boots that one can craft. They allow one to traverse long distances in quick measure. Not to mention, its just fun flying around in rocket boots!One of the biggest differences between Minecraft and Terraria lies in the fact that combat plays a much larger role in Terraria and that is ultimately one of my favorite asepcts about the game. On top of there being enemies galore, all over Terraria's map, you also have the added bonus of multiple boss monsters that one can summon at certain points in the game. The big eye you see on the XBox 360 Terraria box art is one of these bosses, The Eye of Cthulu. The bosses are definitely challenging, especially if your playing the game solo. Playing Terraria with friends is definitely fun, but I actually prefer to play solo a lot of the time as its a much more challenging game when your going it solo.There is a small tutorial at the beginning of the game that gives you a basic idea of the games mechanics and how you go about collecting resources and building items, but its short and not very in depth. That actually wound up being one of my favorite aspects to Terraria, the fact that it just basically throws you into the world and you have to really figure everything out on your own. I can see where this might annoy some people, but I absolutely loved this aspect of the game. Slowly buy surely you learn more and more about the world of Terraria. Its just makes the whole exploration aspect to Terraria that much more exciting. Another interesting aspect to Terraria is the NPC's that populate the world. There are NPC's that will come and live in your shelter, but only if they have thier own furnished rooms. There are various NPC's, each offering various services including healing, selling items, etc. It definitey adds incentive for creating a really nice home base.If there is one aspect of Terraria that I found disappointing, its that its completely void of any sort of story or quests. As amazing as Terraria is, it would have just been that much better if the game actually had a story and quests. Personally, I think that is the next step for this genre, adding a story and various quests. A Terraria styled RPG, one that had a story and quests, now that would be an absolutely amazing game.I am such a big Terraria fan now that I wound up updating to the Xbox One version right away and unfortunately, the developers did not include a slider to adjust the overall zoom level for the game. Basically, the Xbox One game is running at a much higher resolution, which means your able to see a much larger portion of the game world at one time. Of course, this also means that everything is much smaller, which becomes problematic on an HDTV as everything is just too small when your sitting at a distance, which most people do with HDTV's. In order to play it, you really have to sit much closer than you normally would. The good news is that a fix is currently underway. They are working on a slider that can be accessed from the pause menu that will allow for players to adjust the overall zoom level. Hopefully they will get this update out asap as this is really a vital aspect to being able to enjoy Terraria on Xbox One, at least the way it should be enjoyed.Its important to note that the Xbox One version is running the 1.2 update so it is basically the same game as the Xbox 360/PS3 game updated to 1.2. There are a few extras however. On top of that, its 3 times larger than the previous release on Xbox 360/PS3. So basically you can create one massive sized world now, although I am not sure if that is really a positive, lol. I just hope 505 has plans to update this version with the 1.3 update asap!! That update looks like its going to be the best one yet!! It would be a real shame if console versions had to wait a long time to get that content. Hopefully they get it out in a timely manner! If there is one negative in regards to the Xbox One release, besides of course the lack of a zoom slider which again is being addressed, its the overall price. At $29.99, its $10.00 more than the previous console versions. I just don't agree with that level of pricing at all. If anything, it should be the same price level as the original release. There is really nothing here that would dictate a 50% rise in price. That said, I am still giving this game a 5 star rating as there is still plenty enough here to make it well worth the purchase, even at the $29.99 price point. I regularly spend $40-60 on games that normally give me anywhere from 10 to 25 hours of play time so a $30 dollar title that gives me 200+ hours of play time is......well, again its easily worth it even at the new price level.Bottom line - Besides the zoom slider and the $10 rise in price, this game is a home run in every way imaginable. Again, the zoom slider is being worked on right now so hopefully that will be out soon. Until then, you can always pop a squat a little closer to your HTDV or simply wait until the zoom slider patch is released before buying the game. Terraria is easily one of my favorite games of the Xbox 360/PS3 generation and the fact that its now available on the Xbox One....well, thats a very good thing in my book. Wether your new to the series or a fan wanting to update to the next gen version, this is one purchase you won't regret.5 Stars!!Just wanted to update this review and let people know that they did in fact fix the zoom problem with the Xbox One version. From the pause menu, you can use the left and right number to change the overall level of zoom for the game. So Terraria is now wholly playable on an HDTV. You no longer have to sit up close to be able to see anything. It should have been included from the get go, but better late than never.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29UJ2O7J5CRFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MEXP5KG#wasThisHelpful","R29UJ2O7J5CRFC","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you a fan of pin-ups, science fiction, or fantasy art in general, you no doubt know the Heavy Metal name. Started in 1977, Heavy Metal is a science fiction/fantasy comics magazine that is heavily influenced by both erotica and pin-up styled art. Many internationally renowned artists have graced the pages of this magazine through the years including H.R. Giger, Frank Frazetta, and Luis Royo. This book is a culmination of 25 years of Heavy Metal covers, basically 1977 to 2001.What I find most interesting about this book is its literally like a time machine. You might not expect this kind of art to change so drastically over a period of 25 years, but it did, quite dramatically in fact. Going from 1977 to 2001, you can clearly see the changes that were occurring at the time as the covers really are an amazing representation of the art of that time. Its just really interesting seeing the art style transform over such a period of time. Even the bad hair of the 80's can be seen in here, lol. All in all, this is just a great book for Heavy Metal fans, pin-up fans, fantasy art fans, etc.My only disappointment lies in the fact that they stopped at 2001. They really should have made it 35 years of classic covers and brought the date up to 2011 instead of 2001. In my opinion, we have seen a significant increase in the amount of high quality pin-up styled artwork released over the last 15 years. Basically, the years of 2002 to 2014 were easily some of the strongest yet for Heavy Metal covers. Not to mention, we continued to see big changes in the overall style of the artwork itself. I personally attribute a lot of this to the advent of digital artwork programs like Photoshop. It allows artists to work faster and more effectively. It also allows artists to experiment more freely. Including the 2002-2012 covers would have made the time machine aspect that I spoke about up above all the more interesting. It would have been great seeing all of Heavy Metals covers in a single volume. There will no doubt be a 2nd book somewhere down the line, one that will cover the more modern years. That said, I would much rather have had it all in a single volume.There is actually a 1 star review currently up on Amazon. The reason why this reviewer gave this book a 1 star rating is because the book contained nothing but covers. Basically, he didn't read the product description and wound up getting something completely different than what he expected, even tho it says ""25 Years of Classic Covers"" right on the cover of the book!! Ultimately, this is just another perfect example of lazy buyers who can't take the 20 seconds required to read a product description or even researching the book online before buying it. They then turn around and give the product a low rating when really they have nobody to blame but themselves for receiving a product that was different from what they expected. Personally, I absolutely LOVE the idea of hard cover books that concentrate solely on cover runs. In fact, I just wrote a review on Amazon regarding Dynamites New Vampirella art book. That book contains every single cover from Dynamites first Vampirella series and it ultimately of my single favorite aspects about the book. I really hope we see more art books that focus solely on covers.Bottom line - Heavy Metal 25 Years of Classic Covers is a great book, for both art fans and Heavy Metal fans alike. Every cover from 1977 to 2001 in included here. Its not often that we get to compare such a large body of work, spanning such a long period of time. Again, it really highlights the overall changes that occurred in the medium itself and that is ultimately one of the books best aspects. Had this been 35 years of covers and included the years from 2002-2012, I would have given it a 5 star rating. Unfortunately, given its current content....well, its missing many of Heavy Metal's best covers to date so it feels a bit incomplete. Hopefully, once they reach the 40 year mark, which should be in 2017, they will release an updated version of this book that contains all of its covers in a single volume. Until then however, this book will definitely do!!4 Stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CM7FAK1V3QKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1882931742#wasThisHelpful","R3CM7FAK1V3QKV","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got done watching this again this last weekend and its just amazing how well this film stands the test of time. Its as powerful of a film as it was 10 years ago. In my opinion, this is HBO's best movie to date and that is really saying something as HBO doesn't fool around when making films. They have made some absolute masterpieces!This film tells the story of the beginning days of the AIDS virus, as told from the perspective of a small lab of doctors who set out to discover exactly what this new disease really was. Its a true heart wrenching story and you will be shocked at just how our government and the various medical agencies handled this disease at the onset. I think this is Mathew Modine's strongest performance to date and Ian Mckellen puts in an absolutely BRILLIANT performance. The sheer number of cameo's in this film is really quite stunning! Just to name a few, you have Richard Gere, Steve Martin, Anjelica Houston, Phil Colllins, etc. The film finishes off by honoring many of the people that have died of AIDS. Its just incredibly powerful stuff!!All in all, And the Band Played On is easily one of the best films the last 20+ years running! If by chance you haven't already seen it, BUY this DVD ASAP!! This is one film that everybody should see, regardless of their personal beliefs.Honestly, If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would! Absolutely brilliant in every possible way!!5 Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1786YZJ0EBXZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005AQMJ#wasThisHelpful","R1786YZJ0EBXZN","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a huge fan of comic art and definitely prefer to buy prints over comic's, that is of course if prints are available for a particular piece of comic art. Unfortunately, one of the downsides to the art print side of the comic industry is that only a small percentage of covers/comic art actually wind up being made into prints. Some companies and artists, including Dynamite, dont produce prints at all (I am hoping that changes in the near future as Dynamite already has a HUGE portfolio of amazing covers that I would LOVE to see made into prints!). For me, that is where calandars come into the picture. They are a great low cost option for obtaining some of that comic art in a larger print style format.The vast majority of calandars are roughly 12"" x 12"", basically right in the middle between comics and comic prints. Modern comics are roughly 10.5"" x 7"" and most comic art prints are either 11x17 or 13x19. So again, size wise calandars are basically right inbetween comics and comic prints. I first started collecting comic calandars like 3 years ago with J. Scott Campbells Fairy Tale Fantasies calendars. I was really surprised at the overall quality. Given the advances we have seen in printing technology over the last 10+ years, calandars like these are now surprisingly high in quality. Dont get me wrong, calandars are definitely a step down from most art prints being produced, but they are still high enough in quality to make thier purchase worthwhile.You have a couple options in regards to what to do with calendars like this. You can keep them exactly as they are, in which case they become like a really small soft cover art book, or you can take the calandar apart and cut away the actual calandar part, in which case they become like individual 12 x 12 art prints. Once you have them cut free, you can put them into a portfolio, display them on a wall or even matt and frame them. I matted and framed one of the J Scott Campbell pages from his 2013 Fairy Tale Fantasies calandar and it looks great. Nobody would ever know it came from a calandar unless I told them. All in all, I have become a big fan of calandars like this. Again, they are just a great low cost option for obtaining some nice comic art in a print like format. Higher quality images are usually selected for calandars so that just makes them that much better.As for this particular calendar, it has a really nice selection of Dejah Thoris images. Of the 12 images included, I consider 10 of them to be high quality images. The other 2 are mediocre in my book. In particular the J. Scott Campbell, Lucio Parrillo and Joe Jusko images are really the highlights of this set of images and the overall quality of the calandar itself is impressive. I actually wound up getting this for 66% off the cover price, so it was definitely one of the better deals I have gotten over the last few months. In all honesty, even at the full MSRP this calandar is definitely worth it.Bottom line - If your a fan of comic art then you should really give calandars a try. You can keep the calandar as it is, in which case its like a 12 page soft cover art book or you can cut away each of the images, in which case its basically like buying twelve 12"" x 12"" lower quality prints. I say lower quality only in regards to the quality of the paper. Art prints are usually printed on higher quality archival paper. Calandars are printed on lower quality, non archival paper. The image quality however is still top notch. Even at full price, its only like paying $1.25 for each image. Given that most art prints run between $25 and $50 each, its a pretty hard deal to beat given what your getting! If you do wind up going with the print option, don't use scissors to cut them away. Use a paper trimmer. If you don't own one, you can buy a lower end paper trimmer for very little money. Fiskars makes an inexpensive lower end paper trimmer that would be more than suitable for this task. Of course, you can always just use them as they were intended, as a calendar!5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R140PMJ6G23CNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606904043#wasThisHelpful","R140PMJ6G23CNK","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 3rd Vampirella Art book that Dynamite has released. The first art book was The Art of Vampirella, the 2nd art book was the Art of Vampirella: The Warren Years and now comes this 3rd art book, The Art of Vampirella: The Dynamite Years. I was really impressed with the first 2 art books so for me, ordering the 3rd art book was a no brainer. For those that are unaware, Dynamite purchased the Vampirella rights back in March of 2010 from Harris Publications. Selling the rights to Vampirella was a huge mistake in my book, but it's ultimately one I am glad Harris made as Dynamite has done a remarkable job with this series since acquiring it. The series had really gone downhill in the latter years at Harris. It wasn't necessarily bad, but it certainly wasn't very good either. Clearly Harris had lost faith in the franchise and Dynamite saw a perfect opportunity to add an iconic female comic character to its portfolio. All in all, it was without question one of Dynamite's best acquisitions yet.Dynamite certainly didn't waste any time as their first Vampirella series debuted just 8 months later in November of 2010 and they didn't hold anything back. That Vampirella #1 issue had some outstanding covers including two amazing Alex Ross covers, one of which is one of my favorite Vampirella covers of all time, not to mention great covers by J. Scott Campbell, Fabiano Neves, and Joe Madureira. Including all of the different variants, there were ultimately 15 different #1 covers released, most of which were absolutely amazing covers. Clearly Dynamite wanted to send a very strong message to Vampirella fans and as one of those fans, I can tell you first hand that it absolutely worked. The week those #1 issues hit shelves...well, I hadn't been that excited about the Vampirella franchise in a very LONG time and fortunately for fans, that was just the start of what would ultimately become one of Vampirella's best runs yet, especially in regards to covers.What makes this art book such a treat is it contains every single cover from Dynamite's 2010 Vampirella series. What a great move by Dynamite, to include every single cover in the entire series run. They didn't leave anything to subjectivity, they just included the entire cover run in a single book. I really wish some of the other comic companies out there would follow suit on this one. I openly admit that the art is really my favorite aspect of the comic industry. As much as I enjoy the stories, its really the art that keeps me coming back. I actually prefer art prints over the comics themselves, when available, for this very reason (if only someone could convince Dynamite to start producing limited edition prints!!). So I for one really appreciate what Dynamite has done with this art book and I really hope its something we see in future art books as well. Personally, I would love to see Dynamite start releasing art books that focused exclusively on full page cover runs for entire series runs. I would buy one for Warlord of Mars, Red Sonja/Queen Sonja, and Dejah Thoris without hesitation.In regards to the quality of the artwork, this is without question one of Dynamite's best books yet and that is a direct result of the amazing cover's this series has had, from start to finish. At 240 pages, this is the largest of the 3 Vampirella art books released to date (The Art of Vampirella: The Warren Years was 200 pages and The Art of Vampirella was 216 pages). One of my favorite aspects to this book is without question the Lucio Parrillo covers. Lucio is my single favorite comic artist working today and his work with Dynamite has been absolutely sublime! As I wrote in my Amazon review on Lucio Parrillo's art book, I consider Lucio's cover runs with Dynamite to be the best cover runs I have ever seen from a single artist before, in the entire history of the comic industry. Each cover is absolutely breathtaking and they just got better and better with each successive issue. I personally consider Lucio's Vampirella #19 cover, which is included in this book, to be the single sexiest comic cover ever produced and the single greatest Vampirella cover ever produced. Its just the perfect rendition of this character. Since this book contains the complete cover run, it also contains Lucio's complete Vampirella cover run. That in itself made the book a worthwhile purchase for me. Of course, there is a LOT more here than just Lucio's covers. You have amazing covers from Ale Garza, Joe Jusko, Fabiano Neves, J. Scott Campbell,  Jelena Kevic-Djurdjevic, Paul Renaud, etc. All in all, Vampirella's 2010 series run was without question one of the most impressive cover runs I have seen yet in this industry. A pretty impressive feat given this was Dynamite's first Vampirella series and its all contained in this art book.In regards to the quality of the book itself, this falls right in line with Dynamites previous Vampirella art book releases. Its got a nice quality binding, mid-level quality paper, which is what you should expect with any art book that has a price tag below $60, and a nice quality glossy cover. Dynamite definitely doesn't disappoint in regards to quality. For the price, your getting a quality art book that will last a very long time if properly taken care of.Bottom line - Vampirella is definitely one of my favorite female comic figures and Dynamite did just an outstanding job in its first series at the helm. Vampirella's 2010 series had one of the strongest cover runs I have ever seen from a comic before and that entire cover run is included here. Just top notch marks all the way around, definitely one of Dynamites best art books yet. I can't possibly give this book a higher recommendation! If your a fan of Vampirella....well, as I said in the title of this review.....BUY THIS BOOK!5 Stars and then some!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D9P4LZH3Q58R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606905139#wasThisHelpful","R3D9P4LZH3Q58R","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wound up buying Terraria based on a recommendation of a friend. I had initially written it off as some sort of Minecraft clone and to be perfectly honest, I think I am one of the only people in the world that do not really care for Minecraft. I just have a really hard time getting past the low resolution textures and graphics. Anyways, one of my good gaming freinds told me that while it did have similar aspects to it, that of building and resource gathering, it had many aspects that made it very different from Minecraft. I am a big fan of 2D sidescrolling games in general so I decided to take a chance and bought it on Xbox Live Arcade. I basically spent the next week completely immersed in this game.For those unaware, Terraria is basically a 2D sandbox style exploration game. One of the best aspects to Terraria is the world is randomly generated at the start of the game. This type of randomly generated world/dungeon is becoming more and more popular in the gaming world and for good reason. It significantly adds to the replayability of a particular game. Terraria does have many things in common with Minecraft. Like Minecraft, the heart of the game is exploring, collecting materials, and crafting an ever increasing number of items available to you. You start off in the forest, but Terraria has many different biomes with which to explore, each offering unique items with which to craft with. By the time you get 8-10 hours into Terraria, you will already have a large number of items that you can create, including various types of armor and weapons. One of the best items in the game is the rocket boots that one can craft. They allow one to traverse long distances in quick measure. Not to mention, its just fun flying around in rocket boots!One of the biggest differences between Minecraft and Terraria lies in the fact that combat plays a much larger role in Terraria and that is ultimately one of my favorite asepcts about the game. On top of there being enemies galore, all over Terraria's map, you also have the added bonus of multiple boss monsters that one can summon at certain points in the game. The big eye you see on the XBox 360 Terraria box art is one of these bosses, The Eye of Cthulu. The bosses are definitely challenging, especially if your playing the game solo. Playing Terraria with friends is definitely fun, but I actually prefer to play solo a lot of the time as its a much more challenging game when your going it solo.There is a small tutorial at the beginning of the game that gives you a basic idea of the games mechanics and how you go about collecting resources and building items, but its short and not very in depth. That actually wound up being one of my favorite aspects to Terraria, the fact that it just basically throws you into the world and you have to really figure everything out on your own. I can see where this might annoy some people, but I absolutely loved this aspect of the game. Slowly buy surely you learn more and more about the world of Terraria. Its just makes the whole exploration aspect to Terraria that much more exciting. Another interesting aspect to Terraria is the NPC's that populate the world. There are NPC's that will come and live in your shelter, but only if they have thier own furnished rooms. There are various NPC's, each offering various services including healing, selling items, etc. It definitey adds incentive for creating a really nice home base.If there is one aspect of Terraria that I found disappointing, its that its completely void of any sort of story or quests. As amazing as Terraria is, it would have just been that much better if the game actually had a story and quests. Personally, I think that is the next step for this genre, adding a story and various quests. A Terraria styled RPG, one that had a story and quests, now that would be an absolutely amazing game.Bottom line - While Terraria definitely has a lot in common with Minecraft, it is most definitely not just another Minecraft clone. Terraria takes some of the best aspects of Minecraft, adds its own unique qualities, and ultimately creates a completely different kind of crafting/sandbox style game. I had serious doubts about wether I would enjoy this game, and then I wound up sinking like 100 hours into it in the first couple weeks alone. If you enjoy sandbox style games  or games that have exploring at the center, then I highly recommend you give Terraria a try. Its one of the best games I have played yet on Xbox Live Arcade.5 Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N73BPSSIU370/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CV5ZNFO#wasThisHelpful","R2N73BPSSIU370","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was first introduced to Lucio Parrillo's work through Dynamite's Red Sonja series. To say I was hooked from the very first cover I saw would be a massive understatement. I immediately fell in love with the overall style and quality of his work. By the time Dynamite started their Queen Sonja, Vampirella and Warlord of Mars series back in 2009 and 2010, Lucio had become my single favorite artist in the entire comic industry and while Lucio's initial Red Sonja work was amazing in its own right, his work with Queen Sonja, Warlord of Mars, and Vampirella was simply mind blowing!! In my opinion, and I do not say this lightly, Lucio's Queen Sonja, Vampirella, and Warlord of Mars cover runs are without question the strongest cover runs I have ever seen before in the comic industry. Each and every cover he did for those series was just absolutely breathtaking and he just continued to raise the bar with each successive issue. I personally consider his Vampirella #19 cover to be the single sexiest comic cover ever produced, in the entire history of the comic market. Its just absolutely brilliant and is the single best Vampirella rendition I have ever seen. Given the sheer number of quality artists that have drawn Vampirella at one point or another, that is really saying something. What I would do to own the Vampirella #19 original.One of my favorite aspects to Lucio's work is the fact that he paints all of his covers (oil paint is his preferred medium). With more and more artists going digital with each passing year, Its just really refreshing to see artists that still use mediums like painting. Oil paintings tend to have a 3 dimensional quality to them, due to the varying thinckness of the paint strokes. This ultimately gives his work a really unique quality. I personally find Lucio's work to be the perfect cross between realism and comics and its this balance that gives Lucio his signature style.Anyways, if there is an artist out there that deserved a book, its Lucio Parrillo. Unfortunately, the book itself leaves a bit to be desired as its a relatively small book, weighing in at just 64 pages in length. On top of that, a hard cover version was never made available and that is definitely the format I prefer for all of my art books. I am just not a big fan of soft cover books as they just don't hold up as well over long periods of time. That being said, the work in this book is so amazing that it more than makes up for the books shortcomings. Many of the art books that get released are padded with medicore work. Dynamite's Art of Red Sonja is a perfect example. Its 208 pages, but roughly 30% of the work included in the book is mediocre at best and could have been taken out altogether. Lucio's book may be smaller than the artbooks were used to seeing from the comic industry, but its packed cover to cover with outstanding artwork. There is absolutely no filler here. Each and every piece of art in this book deserves to be there. The size of the book is 9"" x 12"", which is a great size for an art book.Bottom line - While the book itself leaves a bit to be desired, the quality of the artwork inside the book is so amazing, that it more than makes up for the books shortcomings. Again, there is absolutely no filler here, just one amazing piece of artwork after another. If your a fan of Lucio Parrillo then this book should be your very next purchase. If your unfamiliar with Lucio Parrillo then this book should be your very next purchase. Basically, if you don't already own this book and your a fan of comic art, then it should be your very next purchase!! Trust me, you wont regret it. This book is, cover to cover, some of the best female comic art ever produced. Now if only Lucio would start producing high quality limited edition prints!!All in all, just an absolutely brilliant body of work!!5 Stars!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D3JM1LM3RVBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8862330146#wasThisHelpful","R2D3JM1LM3RVBZ","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gerber makes two different kinds of comic boards, Full-Back's & Half-Backs. The difference between the two lies in thier thickness. Basically, Full-Backs are twice as thick as Half-Backs, or put another way Half-Backs are half the thickness of Full-Backs. Both brands are alkaline buffered acid-free board. In case your unaware, if you use boards that aren't alkaline buffered and acid free, they will wind up damaging your comic. The acid in the board will actually stiffen your comics and turn the paper brittle.I used to use ComiCare Polypropelyene bags and ComicCare Backer Boards, but I recently switched to using Gerber's Mylites2's and Mylites4's with Full-Back boards. I have been collecting comics for 30+ years, but I had never heard of Mylites bags or Full-Back/Half-Back boards before, probably because none of the local comic shops carried them and I always purchased my bags and boards locally. Then I won an auction like 9 months back on eBay for some older Wonder Woman comics. I was absolutely blown away when I opened up the package. The comics looked amazing. As anyone that has used Mylites bags can attest, the bags are just CRYSTAL clear, especially compared to Polypropylene bags. Again, I was just floored at how amazing the comics looked, not to mention how sturdy they were. I immeditaly emailed the seller and asked him what brand of bags and boards he used and they wound up being Mylites2's with Full-Back boards. Needless to say, I now use Mylites bags (both 2's and 4's) w/Full-Back boards exclusively and am in the process of switching out all of my ComiCare bags and boards with Mylites and Full-Backs.Personally, I recommend going the Full-Back route over using Half-Back's as I really like the extra support the Full-Back's provide. Its important to note that due to the extra thickness, you wont be able to fit as many comic's in a box. Its really the only downside to using these boards. If space is a big issue then you might want to think about using Half-Backs instead.All in all, these are without question some of the best boards in the entire comic market. I highly recommend using Mylites bags along with them. You won't regret it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UDNBVXQZRT3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GQFDF46#wasThisHelpful","R3UDNBVXQZRT3A","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a bit late to the game when it comes to Gerber's Mylites bags and Halfback/Fullback boards. I have been collecting comics for roughly 30+ years and never really gave bags and boards much thought. Dont get me wrong, I always bag and board all of my comics. The way I see it, if a comic is worth buying, then its worth protecting. I just never gave the overall quality or brand much thought, that is until I won a particular auction on eBay. The auction was for some older Wonder Woman comics and the seller had them in Mylites 2's with Fullback boards. I had never seen a Mylites bag before and was absolutely blown away when I recieved those comics.The main difference between regular comic bags and Mylites lies in the materials they are made with. Most of the comic bags on the market are made of Polypropylene or Polyethylene. Mylites are made of Mylar. Its not that Poly bags are necessarily bad, its just that Mylar is vastly superior in terms of protecting your comics. Here is some information on Mylar, taken directly from Gerber's website:""How does Mylar, which is biaxially extruded polyester film, afford more protection? The poly-bags that most everyone sells are ""blown"" films, affording very low density and dimensional stability. Mylar is an extruded film that is simultaneously stretched in two directions to give it maximum strength. In fact, it resists penetration by gases, such as oxygen, 300 TIMES more than the poly-bags. As for strength and stability: it is also several hundred times stronger and more stable. Keep in mind, that we are not talking about 4 or 5 times better as compared to their price; we are talking about offering the kind of protection for 100 years which poly-bags cannot offer for even one year.""Advantages of Mylar Type D Compared to Commonly Used Plastics:1 - Resistance to diffusion of gases like oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, Sulfur Dioxide, etc. is 350 times greater than polyethylene.2 - Permanence. There is no noticeable change in storage after 100 years compared to 2 to 5 years for others.3 - Resistance to moisture, fungus, mold, mildew, acid, oils, grease, and solvents is ""excellent"" compared to ""fair"" for others.4 - Strength and creep resistance is 10 times that of polyethylene, one-third the strength of steel.5 - Volatile Additions--Mylar contains no dangerous plasticizers, slip additives, surface coatings, antioxidants, acid-hydrolysis compared to other commonly used plasticsSo basically Mylar bags offer VASTLY superior protection for your comics than Poly-bags and while this is definitely a big selling point, its not really the main reason why I switched to using Mylites bags. What Gerber's website fails to mention is just how much better your comics look inside these bags. The Mylites bags are just CRYSTAL clear compared to Poly-bags. The visual difference is nothing short of mind blowing. Its like comparing VHS to DVD or DVD to Blu Ray, and that is not an exaggeration. Once you get used to looking at comics inside of Mylites bags, you will have a very hard time going back to Poly-bags. Its like looking at your comics through a dirty window. This, above all else, is the main reason why I switched to Mylites bags. All of the other advantages are just a bonus in my book.There are actually 2 different kinds of Mylites bags. There are Mylites 2's and Mylites 4's. Mylites 4's are basically twice the thickness of Mylites 2's. I actually use both. I jump to Mylites 4's for my really valuable comics and use Mylites 2's for the rest. Also, if your going to use Mylites, then I highly recommend using Gerber's backing boards as well. They have 2 different kinds of backing boards, Fullbacks and Halfbacks. Halfbacks are basically half as thick as fullbacks. Beyond that, they are 100% identical. I personally use Fullback boards as I really like the extra thickness. It just provides that much more stability and protection.Bottom line - Gerber's Mylites bags are without question the best comic bags on the market. They will cost you more money, but they are absolutely worth the extra cost. Of course, you don't have to use Mylites all the time. If cost is an issue, than you can always continue using Poly-bags and only use Mylites for your more valuable comics. In regards to cost, it helps significantly if you buy them in quantity (1000 or more) directly from Gerber. It will basically cut the cost in half. I myself use Mylites exclusively now as I have gotten so used to visual clarity that Poly-bags simply no longer cut it for me. Again, Poly-bags for me are like looking through a dirty window. Once you get used to that Mylar quality, its very hard going back. If your serious about your comics then Mylites bags are without question the way you should go. Trust me, you wont be disappointed!!5 Stars!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNFU9D0IGIXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GQENKEM#wasThisHelpful","R3DNFU9D0IGIXI","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our upstairs bathroom is actually pretty small in size, so I was looking for a smaller cabinet, one that was no more than 15"" wide and 35"" high. I narrowed the field down to 2 units, including this one. I ultimately wound up going with this unit as I really liked the frosted glass door and the fact it had 2 drawers. The other unit I was looking at was just a straight shelving unit. I finally placed my order and it arrived a couple days later.Its important to note that this unit is pretty heavy in its package. If you have any disabilities or have difficulty lifting heavy packages, your definitey going to want someone there to help you get the package inside. Once I had it inside, I just tore open the box and carried the individual pieces upstairs instead of trying to lift the entire packaged unit upstairs. Once I had everything upstairs I proceeded to put the unit together. I have a decent amount of expereince with this kind of build it yourself furniture. All in all I would rate this unit somewhere in the middle in regards to overall time and difficulty in putting it together.The first thing you should do is grab a pen/sharpie and mark off all of the pieces on the parts page to make sure you arent missing any items. I was actually missing one of the longer screws for one of the drawers, but I have a toolbox that is filled with misc stuff like picture hangers, screws, etc. and was able to find a suitable replacement so that was nice as nothing is worse than buying this kind of furniture, opening it all up with the intention of putting it together, and not being able to due to missing pieces. You either have to exchange the item, or get a replacement item sent out from the company. Either way is a pain, but that is simply one of the risks of this kind of furniture. Thankfully, my missing screw didn't wind up being a big deal.Anyways, once you have confirmed that all of your pieces are there, I highly recommend laying them out in an area on the floor as every piece in this kit is designated a letter (A, B, C, D, E, etc.). The first 12 or so letters are all the smaller pieces like screws, anchors, handles, etc. Laying them out in thier alphabetical order makes it easier to go along with the directions as they refer to everything by thier letter. For example, it will say something like ""take 4 screws (A) and attach the 4 metal floor stands (M) to the bottom piece of wood (S)"". So having everything laid out in alphebetical order makes it very easy to grab the pieces needed for each step. If you don't do this you will be searching for the pieces you need with each successive step. Best to just lay them out in alphabetical order. Its important to note that these directions were not the best directions I have ever seen. There are a couple of instances where the drawing is clearly off. For example, when your attaching the magnetic plate that keeps the door shut, the directions are just off in regards to where your supposed to screw it into. Don't worry tho, as you can figure it out by where the pre drilled holes are. Just take your time and you should be able to figure everything out.I did run into one serious issue when building this. The bottom drawer would not close all the way due to one of the screws, one that was used to screw the drawer track in place. The door was running into one of the back screws, which stopped the drawer from closing all the way. I used a drill and that screw just wouldn't go in any farther. If I had been able to screw the screw in just a tad bit farther, there wouldnt have been a problem. I wound up improvising as there was a 2nd hole in the drawer track. It was roughly an inch farther down from the one your supposed to use and that hole was actually a bit wider than the one your supposed to use. I took a drill bit and drilled a hole through that 2nd hole, one that was deep enough for the screw to be screwed in farther. It worked perfectly. The only difference is one of the screws on the bottom drawer is an inch farther down than it was supposed to be. In the end, it simply wasn't a big deal as I was able to improvise and the drawer works perfectly. Of course, I never should have had to do that in the first place and some other people might have had a much harder time finding a fix. I don't know if this is a common problem with this unit or if I just got unlucky. All of the other 7 screws for the drawers went in far enough for the drawer to close so I don't really understand why the 8th one wouldn't. Oh well, again, in the end everything worked out.All in all, it took me around 45 minutes to an hour to put this together. Again, I would rank it somewhere in the middle in regards to overall time and difficulty in putting it together. If you have expereince with this kind of furniture, you shouldn't have any problems. It really is a nice looking cabinet when all is said and done and is absolutely perfect for smaller bathrooms. The biggest problem I have with this unit is the overall cost as this unit is definitely a bit overpriced. Personally, I think $99.99 would be a far more reasonable price. That said, the wife and I absolutely LOVE the cabinet now that its finished. It really was the perfect size for our bathroom and it really does look nice. It also appears to be pretty sturdy. The directions suggest you anchor this unit to your wall, but we didn't and its perfectly stable. As small as this unit is, it actually holds a LOT more than I thought it was going to. The main reason we got this is because our bathroom counter was just cluttered with misc bathroom crap. Razors, shaving cream, lotions, mouth wash, hair products, etc. We cleared off our entire bathroom counter, which was quite a bit of stuff, and there is still plenty of room left. You basically get 2 shelves and 2 drawers, plus the top of the unit itself. The frosted glass just looks really nice! There is just something about frosted glass and bathrooms.All in all we are really happy that we went with this unit. I ultimately gave this unit 4 stars instead of 5 stars for these reasons:1 - It is a bit overpriced. $99.99 would be a far more reasonable price for this unit.2 - The directions could be better, especially the drawings of where certain parts go.3 - It was missing a screw4 - I had to improvise to get the bottom drawer to shut all the way.We really love this unit, but 5 stars just didnt seem right given those issues. In the end, I am 100% satisfied with my decision to go with this unit and if I had the chance to choose again, I would definitely make the same choice. Its just a great unit for smaller bathrooms, one that will give you a lot of extra storage space. On top of that, it really is a nice looking cabinet. If your looking for a smaller cabinet for your bathroom and are willing to pay a bit more, then this is definitely the cabinet I would recommend.4 stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL1PFIEO0GLIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I552QFE#wasThisHelpful","RL1PFIEO0GLIC","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, its disappointing that this was initially supposed to be a hard cover release and was switched last minute to a soft cover release. Soft covers of this size do not fair well over the long term. Your going to start having issues with the binding before you even get through this book. Second, covers always have and always will be one of the main draws for Zenescope comics and as such, cover galleries should be included in every major omnibus like this. A quality cover gallery would have only added like 30 pages tops. Hardly an issue when you already reaching 1600 pages. The fact that they sell the omnibus, and then sell a separate Grimm Fairy Tales Cover Art Book is nothing short of an underhanded cash grab.Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with Zenescope producing a separate cover book after all, there are a lot of people out there who are only interested in the covers. Those people would be interested in buying the cover book and not the omnibus. My problem is with Zenscope making even the people that buy the omnibus buy the cover art book. Those covers should have been included in this omnibus. The fact that they aren't included significantly lowers the overall quality and value of this book. I am a big fan of Zenescope, but this will be my final omnibus purchase until they start including cover galleries, something that should be a no brainer with this company. They know full well what they are doing and again, it amounts to nothing short of a cash grab.The only people I can recommend this book too are fans who are only interested in the stories. If you have no interest in the covers, than this would be a decent purchase, although your still likely going to have binding problems.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA6PQQI24XMEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937068447#wasThisHelpful","RA6PQQI24XMEG","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At last count, Itoya made 5 different versions of their Profolio portfolio/presentation books. They have The Original Profolio, The Profolio Evolution, The Profolio Advantage, The Profolio Expo, and finally The Profolio Professional. The Profolio Professional is Itoya's top of the line model and I highly recommend sticking with this line and this line only, if you can. Unfortunately Itoya doesn't make the Profolio Professional any larger than 13x19 or 14x17. So if you need a larger sized Profolio then you will need to go outside the Professional line. If you need a Profolio that is 13x19/14x17 or smaller than I HIGHLY recommend going with the Professional line. Yes, they are a bit more expensive but they are absolutely worth the extra money.First and foremost the Professional line comes with a soft padded polyurethane cover, which has the appearance and feel of natural leather and is extremely resilient to wear and tear. All of the other lines come with hard polypropylene covers. This may not seem like a big difference to some but I couldn't possible disagree more. The padded polyurethane cover not only looks considerably nicer, it also ages much better than the polypropylene covers. Most importantly, the Professional's just feel so much better in your hands than the other versions. The padded polyurethane just has a great feel to it and ultimately it makes flipping through a presentation book a far more enjoyable experience. I have gotten so used to the padded polyurethane that when I go to my larger 18x24 books, which have hard polypropylene covers....well, they simply feel cheap by comparison. Fortunately I recently found a company that produces an 18x24 presentation book that actually has a cover that has a similar feel and appearance. Actually, its much nicer as its actually made with real leather. (Prat Start 4 Presentation Book for those that are interested).The Profolio Professional also comes with Itoya's PolyGlass sheets, which are the clearest & highest quality sheets Itoya makes. The only other line that carries these sheets are the Profolio Advantage books. The difference is that the Advantage line doesn't have the padded leather cover. So if the sheets are important but you have no interest in the leather cover, one could go with the Advantage line. If you want the best sheets and the best cover.....well, look no further. The Profolio Professional is the line you want. Regardless of which model you wind up going with, all of Itoya's presentation books are acid free and are 100% archival. So in that regard, there is no difference between the different models. The Profolio Professional comes with 24 sleeves so in total it can hold 48 pieces of artwork. I personally think its the perfect size as these things start to get a bit heavy when they are full. I have quite a few Professional 13x19 that are full and while they do have a bit of weight to them, they are still extremely comfortable to look through. I am not sure that would still be the case if they came with more pages.Bottom line - I have been a photographer for over 15 years and have tried more portfolios/presentation books than I care to admit. That said, the Itoya Profolio Professional line is easily one of the best products I have come across yet, especially when you factor in the price. Yes, there are better presentation books out there but they will cost you considerably more money. For the price, the Profolio Professional line is easily one of the best options on the market. I not only use them for my print portfolio's, I also use them for my lithograph/print collection. All in all I cant possibly give them a higher recommendation. Its just a great line of presentation books, for both artists and collectors alike.5 Stars!Edit.....Due to Itoya switching manufactures for these portfolios, the entire line of Profolio Professional portfolios have different covers now. Itoya was having serious problems with creasing in the Polyglass pages, a problem I can attest to personally as I had to ship 4 - 13 x 19 portfolios to Itoya for replacement due to this problem. From what I was told by 2 separate Itoya CS reps, they gave the manufacturer plenty of time to fix the problem and they were not able to do so hence they wound up switching manufacturers altogether.Instead of the smooth, leatherlike appearace of the old cover, the new cover has a textured look and feel to it. Basically, the new covers have a tiny diamond shaped pattern infused into the material, which gives it a textured look and feel. It also has slightly less padding so it doesn't have as much of a padded feel to it. I know quite a few collectors and artists who use these books and the inital reaction from most of them was that they didn't really care for the new cover and that they definitely preferred the older cover better. I myself had this same reaction after all, the cover was one of my favorite aspects to this line of portfolios. Yet as time wen't on, more and more of them began to really like the new cover. Its now been about a year since the new covers were introduced and everyone that I know that uses them has come to really like the new covers and that includes myself. It just took a little time to get used to the change.All in all, its basically the same quality cover, it just has a different look and feel to it. Actually, in regards to durability, I have found the new covers to be slightly superior to the previous covers. As I stated in my initial review, I use these portfolios for both print collecting and creating my own photography portfolios. Some of the portfolios I made are soley for shipping out to potential new clients. Shipping portfolios is really the single best test you can give a portfolio in regards to overall durability. Nothing wears a portfolio down faster than shipping them out to clients. Anyways, from my expereince over this last year, the new covers have a slightly better seam and the diamond texture is better at hiding scratches and scuff marks. Its not a signficant difference, but it was a big enough difference for me to notice.So to sum it up, the differences between the two covers, short of the small difference in durability that I noticed, are really just tactile in nature. Basically the new covers have a different look and feel, but the overall quality remains the same. So the change in cover really doesnt change anything in regards to my original review. This is still my go to line of portfolios and I still recommend them over all of the other portfolios in this price range. Basically, the new cover doesnt change anything in my book. In my opinion, this is still the best line of portfolios anwhere near this price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18NRBKBVNIAMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YEJEAC#wasThisHelpful","R18NRBKBVNIAMZ","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I initially ordered a set of these as I absolutely hated the kitchen towels we were using at the time. They just didn't soak up water very well at all. I swear it was almost as if they were resistant to soaking up water. Anyways, I had heard that flour towels were really great for drying dishes and wiping down counters so I decided to buy a pack. To say I have been blown away would be a massive understatement. These towels are like water magnets. One quick drying and you wont see any residual water left. They are honesty the best drying towels I have ever used, BY FAR!!One day, as I was cleaning our living room, I decided to try the flour towels for dusting. We have serious dust issues in my home and I hate using paper towels as they always wind up leaving small bits of dust or towel behind. I grabbed one of the flour towels from the kitchen, one that had a bit of moisture in it, and started wiping everything down in my living room, including my entertainment center and all the devices held within my entertainment center. I was literally in awe as these towels suck up dust as well as they suck up water. Again, its important to note that these towels work best, in regards to dusting, when they are a little bit moist. I have actually come up with a system that gets the towels to the perfect condition for dusting. I run water in my kitchen sink and then shut it off. I wait like 5 seconds for most of the water to run down the drain. Whats left are just the small drops of water all around the sink. I take the flour towel and I wipe the sink down until its 100% dry. I then run the water and get the sink wet again. Like before, I wait until the water has gone down the drain and then once again I dry the sink entirely. I do this 3-4 times and then wring the towel, like you do to get excess water out of a towel. Wringing the towel will help disperse the small amount of water you have in the towel. Basically you want the towel moist, but not to the point where you can wring any water out of it. If you can wring water out, you got it too wet. If you get it just right, it becomes the best dusting tool you will ever use. It is literally like a dust vacuum. Absolutely nothing is left behind. The surface you use it on will be absolutely 100% dust free. The best part about it is you don't need any cleaning solutions at all, just water and the towel.Fast forward 9 months or so and I now use these towels all over the house. I even tried cleaning our storm door, which is 100% glass from top to bottom. It gets pretty dirty as I have a bad habit of opening the door by pushing on the glass itself, which leaves fingerprints all over the glass. I feed the birds, chipmunks and squirrels on a regular basis and I usually hold the door open by using my hands on the glass. It drives my wife crazy as she is usually the one who cleans it. Anyways, just as a test, I figured I would try cleaning it using my moist flour towel method. I didn't use any glass cleaner at all, just the towel. It took a little more elbow grease but sure enough, it cleaned that glass door just as well as Windex with paper towel, which is the method my wife uses.Whats even more amazing is that I have now been using these towels for well over 12 months and the first 3 towels I pulled out of the package are still in amazing condition. I have no doubt that I will get at least another couple years out of this first batch of towels.All in all, these towels are nothing short of unbelievable. They dry items faster than any other towel I have ever used. They are the best dusting tool I have ever used, they are easy to clean, and last but not least, they appear to last forever.

"I have been a big fan of ""bad girl"" art for a number of years. It was Michael Turner that initially got me interested in this genre of comic art, back when he was working at Top Cow, doing work on Witchblade and Fathom. I was actually in art school at the time, going for my B.F.A. with my focus in photography. I remember going over to a fellow students apartment to pick up some equipment and seeing a big lithograph of Witchblade #25 on his wall. That is one of the more iconic Witchblade covers, the one with Witchblade and Fathom standing in the pool of water next to the waterfall. It just immediately struck a chord in me as I had always loved comics and comic art but had never seen comic art like that before. I had seen ""bad girl"" comic art before but Michael Turner took it to a whole new level quality wise and all of his work was very tastefully done. I have always been a sucker for beautiful women, especially the innate beauty of the female figure. I even spent a semester at art school focusing on this subject matter (photographing the female figure). Of course, MIchael Turner went on to create the company Aspen Comics MLT and became one of the more popular comic artists of this generation and as I'm sure most people are aware, he passed away at a very young age due to cancer. Its extremely unfortunate as he was really one of the pioneer's of the modern ""bad girl"" genre and art style, which has really exploded in recent years.One of the main companies to come out of this explosion of popularity and growth was Zenescope, an independent comic company founded in 2005 by Joe Brusha and Ralph Tedesco. The company focused on re-imaginings of classic tales like Alice in Wonderland. Some of their more popular titles include Grimm Fairy Tales, Alice in Wonderland, Oz, Sleepy Hollow, Neverland, and Brimstone. To say they have been successful would be a massive understatement. They have gone from just a few titles, to having over 30 in 2013. There is even a Hollywood film being made, based off of their Monster Hunter's Survival Guide and will be starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. The success of Zenescope is a testament to the explosive growth the ""bad girl"" genre has seen in recent years. The one thing your guaranteed with Zenescope, above all else, is amazing covers as they hire some of the best ""bad girl"" artists working in the industry today including EBAS, Mike Debalfo, J. Scott Campbell, etc. In fact, an argument can be made that these books are as much about the covers as they are the actual stories inside.All in all, this book exceeded all of my expectations and I have very high standards when it comes to the overall quality of art books, especially when the price is factored in. I was able to buy this book at 35% off the MSRP, which is basically the price of many of the individual ""bad girl"" prints/lithographs that I buy on a regular basis. So for me, this book was just a steal and worth every last penny I spent on it. If your a fan of Zenescope then this book should be your very next purchase. I for one cant wait for Volume 2.Hats off to Zenescope, just a remarkable job all the way around. This is how making a high quality art book is done!!!I am adding on to this review as I think its important to note that this is a limited edition release with an edition size of 2500. There is also a SDCC version, which has a different cover and is 2-3 times the normal price, which is limited to 250. These books also come with a limited edition 8x10 print. I do not know if the print is the same with the SDCC and standard version. I would tend to think not however. I would think they would use a different 8x10 print with the SDCC version, as then its edition size would be equal to the book itself, 250. In all honesty, 2500 is not a very large printing at all so if your planning on buying a copy, I wouldn't put it off for too long. Once these sell out, and they will sell out, your guaranteed to see prices go up by at least 25%, possibly more depending on just how popular this book winds up becoming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R149TJOEI3MLOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939683076#wasThisHelpful","R149TJOEI3MLOU","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stumbled onto Manuka Honey a couple years back and I was really blown away by all of the claims that were being made about this honey. My family eats a lot of honey and we have really made serious changes to our diets in recent years. We no longer eat processed food, get all of our meats & produce from organic CSA farms and we are constantly on the look out for ways to further improve our diets. After reading about Manuka Honey, I simply had to give it a try. The brand I ordered was Wedderspoon Active 16+.To say that I was impressed is a massive understatement. It was the best honey I have ever had. On top of that, my wife used it when her eczema acted up and it worked better than her prescription lotions. We basically became die hard Manuka Honey fans and would panic when our supply started to get low. I recently went to Wedderspoon to place an order and I noticed they now had Organic Manuka Honey available. Well, it took me all of 2 seconds to decide to buy some. We try and buy organic every chance we get so this was a no brainer. I often describe Manuka Honey as liquid gold. Not only does it taste amazing, it also has anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties. Now its offered in an Organic version. Food doesn't get much better than this.The first thing we did when we received it was a blind taste test. I gave it to my wife and she gave it to me. We were curious if we would be able to tell the difference between the two. We both wound up having to guess as the taste was identical. We simply couldn't tell the difference between the two. If you were to pour this into my regular Manuka Bottle, I would never have been able to tell the difference. Basically one of the best foods on earth just got that much better! If you like the non organic version of this honey then you will definitely like the organic version.I cant possibly give Wedderspoon Manuka Honey a higher recommendation and that goes for both the standard edition and the organic edition. Both are amazing products!5 Stars!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAD8PYU9GBX34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SQCXDE#wasThisHelpful","RAD8PYU9GBX34","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These pants are hands down my favorite outdoor pants on the market. Every single aspect of these pants has been carefully designed and ultimately what you get is the best full featured outdoor pants on the market.First and foremost these pants are about as comfortable as pants can get. The cut, which includes a full-length inseam gusset and articulated knees, is outstanding and the weight of the fabric is just right, not too thin and not to thick. The waistline is lined with an extremely soft micro-chamois that feels great against your skin, even after long hikes carrying a 60 pound backpack. I have to give props to Mountain Hardware for going with an 11"" inseam for the shorts. Too many convertible pants have shorts that are way too short. 10"" would be fine too but anything shorter than that and....well, no thanks. Most of the other convertible pants I have tried had 8 & 9"" inseams. Changing back and forth between shorts and pants couldn't be easier, which isn't the case with many convertible pants. The zippers work flawlessly and it only takes a few seconds to get them off or to put them back on. The pockets are actually one of my favorite aspects of these pants as there are a lot of them and they are big enough to hold a lot of gear.Some other important details include having a DWR finish, a UPF 50 sun protection rating, reinforced knees and seat, an integrated belt, and an adjustable drawcord in the leg hem. Overall these pants have everything that one looks for in a great pair of outdoor pants. In particular, the DWR finish is outstanding. On a recent trip to Rocky Mountain National Park, we got pummeled with 7 straight days of constant light misty rain and my legs never got wet. The pants continued to throw off whatever water mother nature threw at them. Some lower quality DWR finishes can become saturated over time and actually start to take in a bit of water. You dont have to worry about that with your Matterhorn's. Some of my Matterhorn pants are over 3 years old and the DWR coatings are still going strong.The only downside to these pants is they can get a bit uncomfortable in really hot weather. If your planning on going somewhere really hot then I would recommend using Mountain Hardware's Mesa convertible pant instead of the Matterhorn. The Mesa has lighter fabric thus more comfortable in really hot weather. In all honesty, I bring both my Matterhorn's and my Mesa's anytime I travel. Its a 1-2 combination that simply cant be beat by other companies.Bottom line - I have been wearing these pants for over 3 years and I really have yet to find their equal. I have worn them in just about every environment that one can find in the US plus some demanding environments outside of the US and they have performed flawlessly each and every time. If your looking for a high quality pair of outdoor pants then look no further. They are a bit more expensive than your average pair of outdoor pants but this is a case where you get what you pay for and its absolutely worth the extra cash.5 Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R260C9A4NOWPC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003AJD136#wasThisHelpful","R260C9A4NOWPC7","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some people collect and some people are collectors. I am definitely a collector at heart and have been since I broke open my first pack of Wacky Packages back in 1978. Even today, when I see the new boxes of Wacky Packages at my local target, the kid in me just wants to buy a box and start opening them up. There is just something special about Wacky Packages and the fact that they are still around all these years later is proof to that fact.When I heard that Topps was going to be releasing a Commemorative Wacky Packages book....well, I couldn't wait to get a copy. As great as Wacky Packages are, these iconic images deserved a larger format, one that would really let people appreciate the art that made the cards so special. An art book was just a brilliant idea and in all honesty should have been produced years ago. That said, I was extremely disappointed when I learned the book was only going to be 6"" x 7"". In the art world, bigger is better and as nice as the book turned out to be, it could have been so much better had they gone with a larger book, 10"" x 12"" would have been perfect. So as much as I would love to give this book a 5 star rating, the size of the book prevents me from doing so.Even with the size issue, this is still an outstanding book. The design is clean, the paper is nice, the artwork is crisp and clean and the dust jacket is made from the same wax coated paper that Wacky Packages used to come wrapped in. If you have ever collected Wacky Packages or have any appreciation for this kind of art than I cant possibly give this book a higher recommendation. Even tho it had been well over 25 years since I stopped collecting Wacky Packages, I immediately recognized many of the images and for a little while at least, it made me feel like a kid again. All in all, this was a book long overdue and Topps and Abrams did a great job bringing it to market.Bottom line - While the format is too small imo, this is still a must buy book for all Wacky Packages fans, young and old alike.4 Stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SQO9C9J60T0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081099531X#wasThisHelpful","R2SQO9C9J60T0K","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using rechargeable batteries for a very long time and I have tried a LOT of the different batteries that are on the market. Some were good, some were just ok, and some were downright horrible. I never really found a battery that I was 100% satisfied with, which is probably why I have tried so many brands, until I tried Eneloop batteries. Make no mistake about it, Eneloop are easily some of the best rechargeable batteries on the market and the new XX model, also known as Eneloop Pro, is just another step up for this fantastic brand of batteries.I could throw out a bunch of numbers that would prove just how amazing these batteries are but most people don't understand battery jargon anyways so I will simply say this: If your looking for high quality rechargeable batteries and your willing to spend a little more to get them...well, look no further. These are the batteries you should buy, period. I was so impressed by these batteries that I immediately purchased 4 - 16 packs and gave my regular Eneloop batteries to other family members. Not to suggest that my original Eneloop's weren't worth keeping. I would have kept them if not for the fact that I have been trying to get some of my other family members to use rechargeable batteries for quite some time, unsuccessfully I might add. So I figured the best way to show them was to give them my original Eneloop's. Given how many Eneloop XX I purchased, I simply didn't need them anymore.I do want to add that if your planning on buying a lot of them, I highly recommend one of the larger recharging stations, like the 16 battery stations you can find here on Amazon. Using the larger stations makes using rechargeable batteries a lot easier.Bottom line - Eneloop XX may cost a bit more but the additional cost is absolutely worth it. These are the best rechargeable batteries I have come across yet and even with the additional cost up front, they will save you buckets of money in the long term.5 Stars!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M0GMV89465F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FRE84W#wasThisHelpful","R3M0GMV89465F4","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will make this short and sweet. If your looking for an adventure game, like the ones Telltale used to make (Sam & Max, Monkey Island etc..), then your going to be disappointed. Telltale has slowly but surely been changing from an old school adventure game company to a....well, I am not sure what they are now. Telltale's recent games are more cinematic experiences than they are gaming experiences and too their credit, this is exactly what they were trying to produce. I just have no interest at all in this hybrid style game Telltale is moving towards. Its extremely disappointing as I am a HUGE fan of old school adventure styled games and Telltale was one of the only companies left producing these kinds of games. So that makes these games doubly disappointing.When I first heard that Telltale had licensed both Jurassic Park and Back to the Future, I cant even begin to express how excited I was. The potential for these licenses in a classic adventure game format is almost limitless. Its obvious at this point that Telltale simply wasn't content making classic style adventure games. This is probably due to the fact that such a small segment of the gaming population actually wants to play this style game after all, classic adventure games have been dying a slow death the last 15 years for this very reason. In other words Telltale was no longer content being a niche market developer and the licensing of Jurassic Park and Back to the Future was all about selling to a larger audience and thus making more money. Telltale wants a bigger slice of the gaming pie. In all fairness, its their company and they certainly have a right to take their company in any direction they see fit. Its just extremely disappointing for classic adventure gamers who have followed Telltale all these years.There are probably a lot of gamers out there who actually enjoy these games, I am just not one of them. Don't get me wrong, I think its great that games have become more cinematic and that story is becoming a far more important aspect to gaming. Just look at all the amazing games we have had the last few years that took this more cinematic approach (Mass Effect, Red Dead Redemption, Assassins Creed, Uncharted, etc). Its taken gaming to a whole new level. Unfortunately Telltale's games have a lot of story but have forgotten about the great game play that needs to go with it, even from a classic adventure game perspective. This is simply not the kind of experience I look for when I am in the mood to play games, especially point and click games. I am not saying this is necessarily a bad game and some people may wind up really enjoying this game. I would just suggest renting before you buy. That way you know exactly the kind of game your getting. If you liked Back to the Future then you will probably enjoy this game as well.Telltale just licensed The Walking Dead (AMC's TV show) so its clear at this point that this is the direction that Telltale is taking from here on out, focusing more on a cinematic experience than an actual adventure game experience. Such a bummer....2 stars","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROP7GMP0P4EH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005N64U52#wasThisHelpful","ROP7GMP0P4EH8","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love fleece sweaters and jackets. Not the original fuzzy type of fleece that Patagonia became renowned for but the sweater quality fleece. The Better Sweater line, for both men and women, is a perfect example of this type of fleece. My wife is also a big fan of this style sweater/jacket and between the two of us....well, lets just say our closet is literally overflowing with fleece sweaters, jackets & hoodies from a slew of different outdoor companies including Marmot, Mountain Hardware, Alpine Lowe, 66 North, Cloudveil, Arc'terex, etc. All of these companies make quality outdoor clothing and all of them make multiple versions of this kind of sweater. With that being said, the Patagonia Better Sweater line (hoodie, regular jacket and 1/4 zip pullover) is the best line of this style fleece clothing that I have come across yet and my wife also shares this opinion.First and foremost this is the best knitting quality I have seen yet for fleece. It really does look and feel like a sweater. Its super soft and just has a great look to it. Best of all it stays that way, even after years of use. We have had some of our Better Sweater products for years and they are holding up amazingly well and this is really where this line distances itself from other companies. All fleece starts pilling eventually, even when the fleece is knitted into this style sweater/jacket. In my experience, Patagonia Fleece simply outperforms other companies fleece when it comes to pilling.The interior is fuzzy and soft, like the normal fleece that Patagonia makes and they use a micro polyester jersey fabric for the trim. These details just add to this jackets overall comfort. The fit of this line is absolutely perfect. If you buy the proper size, you should easily be able to layer underneath it. What really surprised me is just how breathable this line is. Its on par with a lot of my technical fleece jackets in this regard, not something I was expecting.Of course it would be criminal of me not to mention how great this entire line looks. Its one of the cleanest designs I have seen yet for fleece. Patagonia has released a lot of outstanding colors since they started this line a couple years back. In particular the Black Oak is one of the best black colors I have seen in a LONG time. I loved it so much I ordered 2 of each version in that color. Channel Blue and Stone Wash are 2 more that I really like from this years offerings. Patagonia can get a bit funky with their color selection from time to time but in regards to this line, the color selection has been outstanding year after year. The Hoodie version is my favorite version but I really do love the entire line and wouldn't hesitate ordering any of them.Bottom line - If your a fan of fleece jackets or sweater jackets then I cant possibly give the Better Sweater Line a higher recommendation. Its top notch in every regard. Then again, I expected as much as this Patagonia and that is exactly what I have come to expect from their clothing over the last 30 years.

"I will openly admit that many of my favorite games are from past console generations. That's why I consider this HD remake trend to be the most exciting development in all of gaming right now. Beyond Good and Evil, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil: Code Veronica...have loved replaying all of them. Now they have plans for Silent Hill and many others. Its like videogame nirvana. Its great for publishers as they get to make more money on a game that is already made, simply by doing a few upgrades. More importantly, its great for gamers as it gives fans of the games the ability to play the games again, with an HD upgrade. Of course, it also gives gamers that have never played the games a chance to experience them firsthand. Its just a win, win, win scenario all the way around...at least in my book.That brings me to Metal Gear Solid HD, which in my opinion is the best HD remake's done so far. Personally I purchased this for MGS 2 & 3. Peace Walker is just a bonus as I really didn't have much interest in playing it and have only had a few short sessions with it thus far. It is important to note, as others have already done, that Peace Walker was originally a PSP game so if you go in expecting a top notch HD experience on the same level of MGS2 or MGS3....well, your going to come out the other end disappointed. For what it was, the developers did a very good job bringing it to the 360 and PS3.Basically this package is exactly what it says it is, an HD upgrade of these games. The old style controls are still intact, which I am sure many people were hoping would be updated as well. I think controls should remain the same as changing the controls is changing the game itself and that isn't what the HD remakes should be about. Do you think the tension would be the same in Resident Evil: Code Veronica if it had an updated control system? Not a chance. HD remakes should be about preserving the games as much as they should be about updating them to HD standards. Thankfully that is exactly what we get with this package. In all honesty, I think MGS is one of the most polarizing games ever to hit store shelves. People either love them or hate them and this release isnt going to change any minds. The people that love these games will love this package and the people that hate these games....well, they will still hate them.As for how they look, I certainly wasn't disappointed. Personally I think that MGS3 benefited the most from this upgrade but that isn't saying that MGS2 looks bad. Quite the contrary actually as it looks great. Its just that MGS3's environments are better suited to the upgrade. MGS2's environments were small and confined compared to MGS3. In regards to the updated graphics I would rate MGS2 a 7/10 and MGS3 a 9/10. Again, I really haven't played Peace Walker enough to really say much about it, just that it looks good given that it was originally a PSP game.Bottom line - If your a MGS fan then you should absolutely pick this package up and re-experiences these titles. If you dislike the MGS series then skip it. This release certainly isn't going to change your opinion. For those new to the series, there really isn't anything else out there like MGS. You simply have to play it to understand what the fuss is all about. Hideo Kojima is a master storyteller. Things may get quirky from time to time and they might even be a bit difficult to follow from time to time but that's Hideo Kojima. Overall, MGS's stories/characters are some of the more interesting stories/characters to ever grace a videogame console and ironically some aspects of these stories have more relevance today than they did back when they were originally released. There is a reason that this series is one of the most successful in history.As for the developers - Keep the HD remakes coming!!5 Stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SPNXIH4MOWKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SYOOA#wasThisHelpful","R3SPNXIH4MOWKC","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First and foremost, I have to give props to the art department at Bethesda. The art direction for this game is so far above earlier titles that even comparing them to this game is utterly pointless. Its literally in a class by itself and this is evident everywhere you look. The most obvious and impressive improvement has to be the design of the clothing, armor and weapons. The intricate designs are truly breathtaking. Even the cheap equipment you first start off with is stunning. For example, one of the first shields your introduced to in the game is the Hide Shield and its absolutely beautiful. Large metal rivets circle the outer diameter and intricate designs adorn the leather. It even has the dents and nicks one would expect to see from a shield that has seen its fair share of battle. This attention to detail is seen everywhere and it goes right down to the bindings of the books and the crackle glazed dishes and pottery found adorning most tables and halls. When you add this to the significant improvement in graphics....well, what you get is a level of realism that simply blows earlier titles out of the water. This is hands down the best art direction I have ever seen from a video game and ultimately it gives this world a level of realism that we simply haven't seen before.The world itself is absolutely beautiful. One of the first open scenes I came across was a large flowing river that had huge rocks jetting up creating white water/rapids. Large mountains were in the background with wisps of clouds running all up and down the side of the mountain. It was absolutely stunning. I had to just stop and stare for a few moments. The draw distance has been significantly increased and the detail, as I wrote up above, is amazing. The landscape itself is just one big work of art. Traveling around and discovering the land for yourself has always been one of the big enjoyments for fans of this series. Well, Skyrim doesn't disappoint in this regard. In fact, this is easily the best title yet in regards to this aspect of the game. No other game series can compete with the size and scope of the worlds that Bethesda creates for this series and no other game in the Elder Scrolls series even comes close to matching what Bethesda has achieved this time around with Skyrim. They have significantly leapfrogged anything and everything they have done in the past.An issue I feel compelled to discuss is the huge improvement with the 3rd person perspective in this game. As I am sure people are aware, 3rd person perspective in Oblivion was pretty bad. Actually, it was awful. You could switch over for short periods but the game was pretty much unplayable from that perspective. Well, the improvement Bethesda has made in this aspect of the game is nothing short of amazing. Your character no longer looks like he is walking on air and your easily able to interact with your environment. Basically this game is now wholly playable from this perspective. I prefer playing in 3rd person perspective when I am just traveling around and its just really nice to see Bethesda finally take the proper steps to fix this aspect of this series. If your going to include it than at least make it playable and Bethesda has done just that.You can immediately tell that this is an Elder Scrolls game but dont let that fool you. There are a lot of changes behind Skrim. One of the most obvious changes is with the skill system. The skills themselves are pretty much the same. You have Alchemy, Illusion, Conjuration, Destruction, Restoration, Alteration, Enchanting, Heavy Armor, Light Armor, Block, One Handed, Two Handed, Archery, Sneak, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Speech and a new one Smithing. The big difference lies in the fact that you now have specialty skills for each skill category and there are multiple branching paths one can take. For example, the Stealth skill has two different branches that one can take, one that focuses on stealth (Muffled Movement, Light Foot, Silent Roll, ect.) and one that focuses on blade skills (Backstab, Deadly aim, and Assassins blade). This ultimately adds a significant amount of depth to character progression and it also adds to the games re-playability factor as there are now so many different avenues one can take. On top of this there are no longer character classes. You still have the different races of character to choose from but choosing a class is history. What kind of character you become (Spellcaster, Fighter etc.) is solely dependent on the skills you choose to upgrade or in other words its dependent on how you play your character. Personally I love this new system as it doesn't lock you into a specific mold for your character and it leaves everything open for you to explore. Its just a far more organic system and ultimately I think its a significant step forward for this series in regards to character development.Another big change is with the menu system and this is easily one of the best changes made in this game. The new menu system is just far more intuitive. Basically the menu system has been broken down into 4 distinct categories. There is Skills, Items, Map, and Magic. You have to press the menu button to access the menu but once you do that, you no longer need to press buttons. Simply press the left stick in the direction of the menu you want and it automatically changes. Once you have done this, a new subsystem of selections will come up and pressing the left stick to the right will take you to the next menu and so on. No button pressing needed. Basically the left thumb stick controls all of your movements within the menu system, with no button pressing needed. I may not have described it very well but its hands down one of the best menu systems I have ever used. Again, its just a far more intuitive system and it just has a great feel to it. You never leave the main screen when accessing menu's. It just blurs out a bit and acts as a background to the menus themselves. This basically does two things, it helps to keep the menus from detracting from the game itself and it ultimately makes the menu system far more attractive. They have also updated the item menu with 3 dimensional representations of the in game items. You can now spin items around a 360 degree axis, both vertical and horizontal. Its a small detail but a very cool one, especially for the weapons and armor.I also have to mention the skill menu as the way they have graphically laid this system out is...well, its nothing short of stunning. Each individual skill is represented by a constellation in the sky and beautiful gaseous nebula act as a background to the constellations. The visual effect is gorgeous. You can cycle left or right through the skills/constellations and when you access the branching skill set associated with each skill, you suddenly zoom into the constellation itself and the different branching skills are suddenly represented by the individual stars in that particular constellation. Its kind of difficult to properly explain but trust me, the effect is not only stunning, its also nothing short of ingenious. Its EASILY one of the best, if not the best, molds of form and function I have seen yet in videogames. Words simply cant do this games art direction justice. It really has to be seen firsthand to be fully appreciated.Combat has also been overhauled and what we wind up with is a system that is far more fluid, and ultimately a lot more fun, than previous releases. Characters are now able to duel wield both weapons and spells and can even mix up the two. In other words, you can assign a sword to one hand and a spell to another hand or you can go with a staff in one hand and a spell in the other. You can mix it up anyway you want. This new system fits perfectly with the new character system (that being one with no character classes). By adding so many options in regards to how to approach combat, they have essentially added strategy to the mix, something that was entirely lacking in Oblivion. Well, short of actually picking what character class you were actually going to play in oblivion. Basically the combat is just far superior to what we had with Oblivion. Unfortunately you can no longer assign weapons and spells to the D-pad and this is really one of my only complaints with the game. I dont understand why Bethesda decided to get rid of this. They could have even split the D-pad field in two, to accommodate the dual wielding nature of the game. In other words, they could have made the 4 slots on the left for the left hand and the 4 right slots on the right for the right hand. That would still have given you 4 quick slots for each hand.There are lots of other aspects to this game that have been updated but I will leave the rest of them for the player to discover and while there are lots of new additions to Skyrim, fortunately there is also a lot that hasn't changed. Traveling is still done the same way. Once you have actually discovered a location you have the option to fast travel to that location. There are still lots of different factions that one can join, all of which have additional quests associated with them. You can still go about playing the game as you want. You still collect herbs and ingredients for potions. There are still hundreds of different books that one can read. I could go on and on and on and on. This is an Elder Scrolls game after all and Bethesda has kept the heart of the game intact and that is a very good thing indeed. I wont go into the story aspect of this game as I hate spoilers. I will just say that the main story line is fantatstic and is really the icing on the cake.Bottom line - I am a huge Elder Scrolls fan and I have been watching this game since it was first announced. To say my expectations were extremely high would be a massive understatement. With that being said, Skyrim is everything that I hoped for and then some. It hasn't just raised the bar, its launched it into the stratosphere. If your an Elder Scrolls fan then buying this should be a no brainer. This is the kind of game people buy consoles for and this is easily Bethesda's best work yet in regards to this series. They have just taken this franchise to a whole new level. Thankfully, I have lots of time in the coming months to discover all that this game has to offer and make no mistake about it, what this game has to offer....well, its limited only by the amount of time you spend with it.Outstanding, simply outstanding!5 Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAU07D2RSCLCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HYK956#wasThisHelpful","RAU07D2RSCLCE","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I initially purchased this after reading an article in a food magazine which highlighted the high fiber content. On top of that I absolutely love Coconut and am always looking for new and exciting products for the kitchen. Of course, Coconut flour just sounds good so I simply had to give it a try. I am glad I did as its really one of the more unique flours I have ever come across. First and foremost it is absolutely wonderful in homemade smoothies, as others on here have already suggested. It has a very subtle flavor and really compliments a lot of smoothie recipes perfectly. You can really up the fiber content of your smoothie without severely effecting the overall flavor.Another great way to use coconut flour is with chicken or shrimp. Simply dip the chicken or shrimp in an egg bath and then coat with coconut flour. We then brush on a little more egg and sprinkle some Red Bob's Unsweetened Coconut flakes on top. We then fry using coconut oil. Its important to note that we fry at a lower temperature so as not to destroy all the nutritional value of the Coconut oil. High temperatures really kill a lot of the nutritional value of oils so I recommend cooking at lower temperatures when using oils like coconut oil or olive oil.We also tried coconut flour in many other recipes including my families nutball recipe. The first attempts didn't work out too well but we eventually found a good substitution ratio and the results were really quite amazing. We have also made muffins, pancakes and even english muffins. What I have learned is that Coconut flour is truly a unique flour and with a little bit of experimentation and patience, it can really be an amazing substitute for more popular flours. It is a much dryer flour and as such you will have to compensate for that in your recipes. Many times this can be countered by adding more eggs. I have found that a good starting point is a substitution of roughly 20-30%. Its also important to note that most of the fat/oil has been taken out so Coconut flour is not a good source for people looking to get coconut oil into their diet. You need to buy the meat or the oil separately if your looking to put some coconut oil into your diet. The flour itself actually goes through processes that pull the oil out.Bottom line - Coconut flour really is a very unique flour. It has a light flavor and can really add magic to your recipes. On top of that its absolutely loaded with fiber. Coconut flour will make a magnificent addition to your kitchen cupboard. Again all it takes is a little experimentation and a little patience and you will quickly learn just how wonderful this flour really is. I cant give this flour a higher recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12A9KV1O3GPQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KENKZ8#wasThisHelpful","R12A9KV1O3GPQH","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love OXO Pop containers. As I have made clear in all of the reviews I have written here on Amazon in regards to these containers, I not only consider these the best storage containers on the market but I also consider them to be the best storage containers ever designed, period. The ease of use, the quality of the seal, and the sheer number of different sizes available easily make these the best storage containers I have ever used. The difference we have seen in regards to the freshness of the food we store in these containers, compared to our old storage containers, has been nothing short of stunning. With that being said, I was praying that they would come out with a stainless lid set and even emailed OXO on multiple occasions begging them to release such a set. My kitchen is largely detailed with stainless steel so stainless POP containers would go perfectly in my kitchen and of course, stainless lids would just make these containers that much higher in quality. When I actually stumbled onto the stainless versions of these containers at one of my local kitchen supply stores...well, lets just say I was absolutely ecstatic and immediately purchased a bunch of them.Basically these are the same exact containers they were before. The only change is that the lid is now stainless steel instead of white plastic. Everything else is exactly the same and that is a very good thing as again the original containers are outstanding in every regard. The quality of the stainless lids are exactly what I would have expected coming from OXO. They are top notch and just look great. What I would like to see now is the ability to just buy the lid as I already had well over 30 of the original containers and it would be nice to be able to update many of them with the stainless lid without having to buy the whole container. The 3.4 quart container is probably our 2nd favorite POP container as its perfect for whole boxes of cereal and we usually have at least 3-4 different types of cereal on hand at any given time. This is one area where we have seen the biggest difference in regards to freshness. Our cereals are now staying fresh 2-3 times as long as they were before moving to POP containers.Bottom line - OXO's POP containers are, in my opinion, the best storage containers on the market. They not only keep a perfect seal but they also look great and can actually save a significant amount of cabinet space. The new stainless versions just one upped the original version as the are just that much higher in quality and just look that much better, especially for people like myself that have a kitchen that already has a lot of stainless steel in it.

"I mostly shoot large format (4x5 and 8x10) but there are some circumstances where I love to shoot with either my Mamiya 7 or my Canon. In particular, I love shooting natural, low light level scenes of people. I refuse to use a flash as it absolutely kills the look I am going for. So lenses like the 50mm 1.0 and the 85mm 1.2 are an absolute godsend for this kind of shooting. These lenses let in so much light that they basically create a style of photography unique unto themselves as you simply cant do some of the things you can do with these lenses with other lenses. Did I say that correctly? Once you master these lenses and what they are capable of, it will blow you away what you can do with just a little bit of light. Add to this the development side of the zone system and its truly remarkable what these lenses are capable of producing.I have always been drawn to the unique qualities that lie within certain aspects of photography. I think its one of the main reasons why I shoot with the camera's I shoot with and why I am still, for the most part, shooting with film. For example, one of the main reasons why I love large format so much, beyond the amazing image quality, is because you can do so many unique things with perspective, focus, and depth of field simply by playing with the alignment of the standards. Well, the 50mm 1.0, and the 85mm 1.2 are the standards in my 35mm photography work. If it weren't for these lenses, I honestly dont think I would still be shooting with 35mm. The lenses themselves are truly works of art and can significantly extend your abilities in regards to shooting in low light level situations. Of course the quality of the glass itself is top notch. Then again, if your interested in this lens then you are probably already aware of the quality of these lenses (razor sharp, amazing color rendition, etc.).Bottom line - The 85mm F1.2L II is an absolutely brilliant lens. As I stated in the title of this review, I consider it 2nd only to the 50mm 1.0L. If your looking for a portrait/people lens that is capable of shooting in low light level situations then this is the lens for you. I couldn't imagine my kit without it.5 Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MH4L2WVBA9CC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EW9Y4M#wasThisHelpful","R3MH4L2WVBA9CC","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ill make this short and sweet, this makes a great gag gift. I recently brought a few packages as a stocking stuffer for my nephew, who just entered 10th grade. As he was opening it, I told him that I asked a bunch of his friends what they thought he might want for Christmas and I told him that almost all of them recommended this. Of course I didn't really ask his friends, it was just a set up for him opening it and I made it seem as serious as possible. Its important to note that he opened it in front of my entire family, roughly 30 people strong, and nobody but me knew what it really was. To say that laughter erupted in the room would be a massive understatement. Nobody, not a single person in the room, had ever heard of this soup and everyone found it absolutely hilarious that this was really not a joke gift, that its an actual soup. I dont care who you are, if you can say Spicy Cock Soup without having even the slightest urge to laugh....well, lets just say that the vast majority of people out there that actually have a sense of humor will find it hysterical, especially if its the first time they have ever seen it.The thing with my nephew actually went down a few years ago and family members still bring it up from time to time. If you could have only seen the look on my nephews face, lol. Anyways, if your looking for a great gag gift then look no further. This is one of the best gag gifts I have ever come across. What makes it so great is the fact that its not a gag gift. This is a real product and this is the real name. As for the soup itself, I have no clue. Have never tried it and I dont think I ever will.

"Bissell's Little Green carpet machine is a must have item in our house. We recently had a cat get sick and we dealt with throw up on a pretty much daily basis for 4+ months, sometimes 2-3 times a day. During that time we experimented with a lot of different soap products for the Green Machine and this 2X Advanced Formula was easily the best one that we tried, especially in regards to how your carpet smells after cleaning. This formula smells really nice and it works great on stains. Overall this is a great formula and a significant improvement over the non concentrate Bissell formula that we used to use.We tried using a more dilute mixture with this, as one of the reviews on here suggests, and we simply didn't get the same results. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a huge difference but there was a noticeable difference. We tried multiple weaker dilutions side by side with the recommended dilution and there was a very clear difference. We dont have a problem with the soap attracting dirt as we always do a 100% water rinse after using soap. This was a tip passed down from our professional carpet guy that we bring in a couple times a year to clean our carpet. We have been using him for over 15 years and the man knows almost everything there is to know about carpets. He basically told us that if we were going to use bissell machines that we had to make sure to get all of the soap out of the carpet. This is an issue with the home carpet machines as they dont have anywhere near the suction that the professional machines have. The best way to make sure your getting the soap out is to do a 100% water rinse after using the soap. In fact, he recommended going over it twice with water. If you dont get all the soap up then yes, it will eventually dry and become sticky and this will attract dirt and make your carpet get dirty faster. On top of that, the soap itself can actually damage the carpet fibers when left on for long periods.I personally recommend using this soap at the recommended dilution, especially if your dealing with a noticeably dirty carpet or a stain. Just make sure you go back over it one or two times with just water to make use your getting all of the soap up. That's how we do it and we have had nothing but great results. Then again, I would recommend doing the water rinse even if you did decide to dilute this formula a bit more.Bottom line - We consider our Bissell an absolute godsend and have no doubt whatsoever that our carpet would have been toast a LONG time ago if it weren't for our Bissell. With that being said, this 2x Advanced Formula is the best cleaning formula we have tried yet. Together with a Bissell...well, they create a one two punch that very few stains can stand up too. If you have kids or animals, a Bissell and a bottle of 2x Advanced Cleaning Formula should be considered absolutely mandatory!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROP2Z1HZ01SKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52WWO#wasThisHelpful","ROP2Z1HZ01SKW","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been drinking green tea for roughly 10 years now and I love everything about it, except the fact that its more difficult to steep due to the required temperature of the water. The method I have used was basically boiling the water and then either waiting for it to come down to the right temperature or adding small amounts of cool water to bring the temperature down. I wouldn't necessarily call it a pain but I certainly wouldn't call it convenient either. I also drink Black tea from time to time and its just so nice to be able to make a cup of tea without fixating on the water temperature. I wish green tea was as easy to steep as black tea.Well, I finally decided to give an electric kettle a try and boy am I glad I did. It has basically taken the whole process of heating the water and turned it into a non issue, something I dont even have to think about anymore. I have a very high quality digital thermometer in my darkroom and I figured I would test how accurate the temperature settings were. The Green Tea setting, really the only one I was concerned with, was incredibly accurate. I tested it 4 different times and each time I got very accurate results. Basically I got results that were always within a single degree from the desired temperature or in other words the green tea setting gave me water that was basically 180 degree's (+/- 1 degree). To be perfectly honest, I wasn't expecting it to be this accurate. Its important to note that the water I use for my tea, and the temperature test, is double filtered, first through a reverse osmosis filter and then through a Brita pitcher.I will admit that I would have preferred that this unit was 100% stainless steel. The plastic lid and plastic temperature knob bring the quality down a small notch. I would have actually paid more for a 100% stainless unit. I am just not a big fan of adding plastic components to an item like this. With that being said, this unit is very close to perfect and ultimately it makes the process of making green tea, or any drink that requires heated water, a very simple process. An electric kettle is now a must have item in my house.5 Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H9U8CIHSN3LN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001A5NFQA#wasThisHelpful","R1H9U8CIHSN3LN","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will be the first to admit that cooking with quality cookware and utensils can make all the difference in the world in regards to how enjoyable cooking can be. For example, there is just something about using a great set of knives or cooking on a great set of pans. IMO, this extends to everything you use in the kitchen. With that being said, we had the cheapest set of measuring cups and I have, for the longest time, wanted to buy a nice set so I finally pulled the trigger and ordered this set. That was roughly 9 months ago and I can now safely say that these measuring cups are top notch in every way. First and foremost the quality is amazing. They are made from high quality 18/10 stainless steel (18% chromium and 10% nickel). Make no mistake about it, you take proper care of these and these will be the last measuring cups you ever need to buy. There are 7 measuring cups in total: 1/8 Cup, 1/4 Cup, 1/3 Cup, 1/2 Cup, 2/3 Cup, 3/4 Cup, and 1 Cup. They stack perfectly together which means the entire set takes up very little space overall.One of my favorite aspects to these measuring cups are the really long handles. You can scoop really far down into bags and containers and it just makes them easier to handle. Because of the long handles, a few of the smaller cups are unstable when empty. In other words, the long handles makes them tip to the side of the handle. They cant rest flat when empty. This is a total non issue for me as I never use the smaller measuring cups in a way that would cause this to be a problem. Thankfully they didn't give the cups that do this smaller handles as I love how the entire set comes together for storage. Having a few cups with shorter handles would have really taken away from this aspect of the set.Bottom line - These are the best measuring cups I have ever used. Again, if properly taken care of this will be the last set of measuring cups you ever need to buy. Most importantly their just a real pleasure to use in the kitchen. A top notch set of measuring cups in every regard!5 Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J7X4TD44P47N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009VEOGG#wasThisHelpful","R1J7X4TD44P47N","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players...."" This is the phrase that begins a monologue from William Shakespeare's ""As You Like It"". Its one of my all time favorite quotes. With that being said, changing the opening monologue around a bit can really describe, in perfect terms, the current state of the world.""All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely puppets....""It really does perfectly describe the current state of our planet and if your here reading this...well, odds are you either know or suspect that the so called puppet masters are the members of the Bilderberg group. What I personally find so crazy is the fact that the whole ""Bilderberg Group"" topic in general is still widely considered to be a ""conspiracy theory"". Its important to note that the term ""conspiracy theory"" has purposely been twisted in recent years to have a completely different meaning than it used to have. The original meaning of the term was basically ""a theory that explains an event or set of circumstances as the result of a secret plot by usually powerful conspirators"". The new meaning of the term still has ties to the original, the difference now is that the term has an immediate association with ""crazy people"" or people on the fringe of society. Basically, the word conspiracy is now immediately associated with the word crazy. This new association was intentionally and methodically done by the people that control the media and to say they have been wildly successful in this regard would be a massive understatement. If you were to play a word association game and ask people to name the first thing that comes to mind when you say a particular word, I am betting over half of the people asked would associate conspiracy theory with crazy. Again, this was intentional as it basically discredits anything you slap that label on.Anyways, getting back on topic, I just dont understand how the ""Bilderberg Group"" can still be considered a conspiracy theory as a lot of things are known to be absolute fact. For example, we know for a fact that the Bilderberg Group is made of the worlds most powerful and wealthy people. We know for a fact that these people meet in secret every year. We know for a fact that no press is allowed and the entire thing is shrouded in secrecy. I just dont get it. What do people think these people are doing? If they have nothing to hide, why not let the press attend? I dont care what anyone says, nothing good can come from the worlds most powerful, wealthy, and corrupt people meeting in secrecy every year. Those who do believe such a thing have been brainwashed into complacency.As for the book, Daniel Estulin probably has more knowledge on this topic than anyone else in the world, short of the Bilderbergers themselves. He is one of a small handful of people that have exposed The Bilderberg Group. Risking both life and limb, these people have pulled the curtain back and exposed this group for what it really is. If you have any interest in this subject then this is easily the one book that you must read. In all honesty, this book should be required reading for everyone as the only power we have against these people is our numbers and unfortunately the number of people that know the truth are VASTLY outnumbered by those still in the dark. Hopefully books like this will change that fact in the coming years. Until then the only advice I can give is to educate those around you and getting people to read this book would be the best way to do that.Bottom line - Make no mistake about it, The Bilderberg Group is real and these people are not meeting in secret every year to discuss their favorite colors. ""Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely"". This is also one of my favorite quotes and ultimately I dont think I have ever heard a quote that had more truth to it than this quote does. Power does corrupt. In fact, everywhere you look you can find an absolute boatload of evidence to back this up. The Bilderberg group is all about absolute power, control and ultimately corruption. If these people are ever going to be stopped then people must first wake up to whats really going on. Reading this book and getting others to read this book is the best way to go about doing that.The curtain has been pulled back. Its time that people learn whats back there.5 Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20RY6UAT3D3ZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0979988624#wasThisHelpful","R20RY6UAT3D3ZO","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have had an Xbox 360 in our home since the system first came out and I can easily say that the last 6 years with this console has been the best 6 years I have had yet with a videogame system and that is saying something as I have had just about every console released since Pong was released back in the mid 70's. Microsoft, a company that I was never too fond of given the fact that I am an Apple computer user, has really done an outstanding job with this system. While there were some hardware issues with the earlier consoles, I can safely say that the Xbox 360 S is a top notch console with none of the problems that plagued earlier models. Its superior in almost every way to previous models.My single favorite aspect to this system is without a doubt Xbox Live and all of the things that come along with the service (you get 3 months included with this holiday pack). Basically Xbox Live gives you the ability to play games online and lets you download arcade games, game demos, trailers, TV shows, music and movies. Out of all of the things that MS has done, putting so much focus on the development of Xbox Live is, in my opinion, the smartest thing they have done yet in regards to this console. Xbox live has really become a fantastic part of the Xbox gaming experience. In fact, I couldn't imagine Xbox without Xbox Live. In particular, both my son and I love Xbox Live Arcade. There is now a massive assortment of games on Xbox Live Arcade and the nice thing about the games, besides the lower cost, is that they dont require the time investment that most of the regular Xbox games require. Its a more casual gaming experience and I really appreciate that, especially during my busy season with photography as I simply dont have the time to invest in big games during that time of the year. I love that every game available on Xbox Live Arcade has a demo available so you can actually try it out before making up your mind on whether or not to buy it. Xbox Live also has an on demand game section, which are regular disc based releases that you can buy and download over Xbox live. I personally dont buy on demand games as the prices really aren't competitive and I just cant justify buying a download version of a game when I can actually buy the physical version for the same price or less. Of course, buying the physical copy gives you the ability to sell it later on. This isn't possible with downloaded versions. Given that aspect alone, on demand games should be at least 5-10 bucks cheaper than the physical version and unfortunately that just hasn't been the case and this is one area where Xbox live can be significantly improved.Xbox live also offers additional services like Netflix, Hulu Plus, ESPN, Zune, and LastFM. We currently use Netflix and ESPN and we love both services. Its important to note that Microsoft recently announced that 40 additional entertainment partners will soon be joining the Xbox Live experience including Comcast, HBO GO, Syfy, Verizon FiOS, Bravo, and Xfinity. This really isn't surprising given the fact that Microsoft has stated many times that their vision for the future of Xbox lies in it becoming a hub for entertainment in your home, not just a videogame console. With the announcement of 40 additional entertainment services being added, MS are now one step closer to making this a reality and I expect the list of services will only continue to grow over the coming years. Basically this gives people the ability to individualize their TV experience through Xbox live. I only watch about 5% of the channels I receive through cable, and pay a hefty price to be able to do so. So I am very interested in where this console is going in this regards.I also really like that MS has been focusing more and more on the family side of gaming as my wife enjoys gaming and we have an 11 year old son. In particular, we really enjoy Family Game Night which highlights a different family game every Tuesday. The number of games suitable for younger children has increased substantially over the last few years and the console itself has parental options that allow you to lock out certain content from your children. This includes games, movies and TV shows. I travel a lot so these options are very important to me. I dont have to worry about what content my son is accessing while I am away.As for regular gaming, Xbox certainly doesn't disappoint. There are so many great games available that I literally dont have time to play all of them. Just look at the games released, or being released, in the last quarter of 2011. You have Gears of War 3, Forza 4, Battlefield 3, The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, Assassin's Creed: Revelations, Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Saints Row 3, Batman Arkham City, etc. Those are just the high profile games. Of course, Xbox has a huge catalog of titles already available and many of those games can be purchased for 20 dollars or less. You can even play a large number of original Xbox titles on the 360, many of which are amazing games and could easily be found for 10 bucks or less at used game stores. Most people have a limited amount of time that the can devote to playing games and given the sheer number of great games available....well, lets just say that the vast majority of people will have the same problem I have, that you dont have time to play all the games you want to play.For those that are looking to get their first console, this holiday bundle is a great deal. It has the 250 Gig HD and comes with 2 of the biggest games released this past year, Halo Reach and Fable 3. Its important to note that the you dont get the physical copy of Halo Reach. You get a code that gives you the ability to download it from Xbox Live On Demand.Bottom line - Microsoft has really done a remarkable job with their Xbox gaming system. They have had a few bumps along the way but overall the Xbox is a top notch gaming system that now offers far more than just gaming. Whether your looking for casual gaming, hardcore gaming, online gaming, family gaming, or even motion based gaming, the Xbox has more than enough to fit the bill. As I stated originally, the last 6 years with the Xbox 360 has without a doubt been the best 6 years I have ever had with a console. Xbox 360 has become a staple in my house in regards to my families entertainment. Whether its for gaming, movies or TV shows, the Xbox doesn't disappoint. I really couldn't possibly give this console a higher recommendation. Its just a top notch entertainment device.5 Stars!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GMGF1H5HV56Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005VBVQBU#wasThisHelpful","R3GMGF1H5HV56Z","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These pants are hands down my favorite outdoor pants on the market. Every single aspect of these pants has been carefully designed and ultimately what you get is the best full featured outdoor pants on the market.First and foremost these pants are about as comfortable as pants can get. The cut, which includes a  full-length inseam gusset and articulated knees, is outstanding and the weight of the fabric is just right, not too thin and not to thick. The waistline is lined with an extremely soft micro-chamois that feels great against your skin, even after long hikes carrying a 60 pound backpack. I have to give props to Mountain Hardware for going with an 11"" inseam for the shorts. Too many convertible pants have shorts that are way too short. 10"" would be fine too but anything shorter than that and....well, no thanks. Most of the other convertible pants I have tried had 8 & 9"" inseams. Changing back and forth between shorts and pants couldn't be easier, which isn't the case with many convertible pants. The zippers work flawlessly and it only takes a few seconds to get them off or to put them back on. The pockets are actually one of my favorite aspects of these pants as there are a lot of them and they are big enough to hold a lot of gear.Some other important details include having a DWR finish, a UPF 50 sun protection rating, reinforced knees and seat, an integrated belt, and an adjustable drawcord in the leg hem. Overall these pants have everything that one looks for in a great pair of outdoor pants. In particular, the DWR finish is outstanding. On a recent trip to Rocky Mountain National Park, we got pummeled with 7 straight days of constant light misty rain and my legs never got wet. The pants continued to throw off whatever water mother nature threw at them. Some lower quality DWR finishes can become saturated over time and actually start to take in a bit of water. You dont have to worry about that with your Matterhorn's. Some of my Matterhorn pants are over 3 years old and the DWR coatings are still going strong.The only downside to these pants is they can get a bit uncomfortable in really hot weather. If your planning on going somewhere really hot then I would recommend using Mountain Hardware's Mesa convertible pant instead of the Matterhorn. The Mesa has lighter fabric thus more comfortable in really hot weather. In all honesty, I bring both my Matterhorn's and my Mesa's anytime I travel. Its a 1-2 combination that simply cant be beat by other companies.Bottom line - I have been wearing these pants for over 3 years and I really have yet to find their equal. I have worn them in just about every environment that one can find in the US plus some demanding environments outside of the US and they have performed flawlessly each and every time. If your looking for a high quality pair of outdoor pants then look no further. They are a bit more expensive than your average pair of outdoor pants but this is a case where you get what you pay for and its absolutely worth the extra cash.5 Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB76IWERNCQ5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035PQV1E#wasThisHelpful","RB76IWERNCQ5F","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stopped by a buddies house last night to pick up a receiver I had lent him and he was playing Goldeneye when I walked in. He asked me if I wanted to give it a try and to make a long story short, I wound up leaving his place roughly 3 hours later, with the game in tow. He had to work super early so he lent me the game until he gets off of work tonight. I popped it in as soon as I got home and didn't put it down until I passed out at roughly 5AM.First and foremost this game wasn't even on my radar. In fact, I am being 100% honest when I say that I didn't even know it was coming out until I saw it in my buddies console. I visit Amazon's videogame sections, among many other videogame sites, all the time and I dont remember ever seeing anything about it. I also subscribe to a bunch of videogame magazines and I cant remember ever seeing it in any of those either. This game was completely invisible to me, until last night. To say I was impressed is a massive understatement. This is easily the best James Bond game I have played in a long time and it ultimately makes the recent James Bond games like Quantum of Solace and Bloodstone look even worse than they normally do. This is what a James Bond game is supposed to be like.My favorite aspect of this game is that you can play the missions as you like and the controls are absolutely spot on. In fact, these are the tightest controls I can ever remember in a James Bond game. They really are spot on. I love games that reward a stealthy, patient approach yet allow you to run in guns blazing if you so desire. Goldeneye Reloaded is perfect example of such a game. I am roughly 7 hours in and the variety in missions has been outstanding. The developers mix things up extremely well so you never feel like the game is starting to grind or starting to get boring. Even the vehicular missions are done really well. Most importantly, this just feels like a James Bond game through and through, something that was lacking entirely in recent Bond games. Again, this is what a James Bond game should be like.I have seen a lot of negative comments written in regards to this games price, which is really one of the main reasons why I chose to write this review. For the most part, I agree with the criticism as it would have been nice to see this game have a 40 dollar price point, which is really in line with what we have seen from other HD upgrades. With that being said, from a game play perspective...well, this game is absolutely worth the 60.00 especially if your a big fan of James Bond or stealth/shooter styled games. If you have a problem with the price, simply wait a few weeks for the price to come down. I plan on buying a copy myself and I am not planning on waiting like I do with most games. My son is a huge James Bond fan and he will absolutely love this game. I already do.5 Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R6FY2MH137P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DKMC6M#wasThisHelpful","R3R6FY2MH137P4","A2SA6LR78V49UV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SA6LR78V49UV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great little aromatherapy diffuser. It takes up very little space and works well.Pros:+Compact+Attractive (from a distance)+Multiple LED lighting options to suit your mood+Built-in timer with various settings+Works well for a small room+Detachable power cordCons:-Short power cordThis is like a mini ultrasonic humidifier, that allows you to add your own essential oils for aromatherapy. It holds 350ml (which is a lot for this product category) and is easy to refill. You simply lift the globe off the base, remove the power cord, and slightly twist the globe apart (press fit, not screwed) and you can dump or refill as needed. It's so small it can be placed anywhere in any room so long as you have an AC outlet nearby. I really wish it were powered by micro USB like so many devices these days. That would make it easy to move around and source longer cables. In any case, this little diffuser produces visible mist that fills a small to medium sized room. You can't adjust the output, but you can adjust the duration or the amount of essential oil you place into the container, so the strength is not a problem and can be adapted to different rooms and personal preferences.

"Pros:+Excellent build quality+Compact size+Long lasting lithium battery+Powerful flashlight+Automatic safety features+Nice carrying case+Backup USB charger+Includes both car and wall chargerCons:-Very minor, but I wish it recharged via micro USBAnker is a quality brand in the portable battery market and they don't disappoint with this jump starter. It's a very high quality build from the charger down to the carrying case that's provided. The jump starter itself is solid and rubberized for easy grip and added protection. There's a orange LED power level indicator that lights up when the unit is powered on. There are two USB output ports that will charge any device that takes a charge via USB and goes up to 2.1 Amps. I have portable USB chargers already, but this is nice to have in the car as an emergency item. There is a small charging port used to recharge the jump starter. It was nice that Anker includes both a car charger and wall charger, but I really wish these jump starters could be charged by micro USB themselves. I have plenty of chargers around the house and in all my vehicles that could do the job. In any case, back to the jump starter. The device also has an LED flashlight that is triggered by long pressing the power button. The flashlight can be switched to strobe in SOS as well and is surprisingly bright. I really like the automatic safety features for this jump starter. I'm keeping this one in my mom's car and won't have to worry about installing the cables incorrectly or in the wrong order. The jump starter won't work unless you have everything properly connected. It's small enough to fit in the glove box, but since it comes with such a nice carrying case, we keep it in the trunk. I have another jump starter that works just as well in jumping our vehicles (tested by disconnecting the battery and starting the car with only the jump starter), but the plastic carrying cases that come with other ones breaks so easily. This sturdy nylon case will last beyond the charger itself!

" 2:36 Mins These is a great bluetooth headset that provides a lot of bang for your buck. They are a lot smaller than I expected from the product pictures. Thats a good thing. The sound quality is good, better than I would expect for this price category. What surprised me the most was how well they fit being a semi rigid design. I use headsets while I'm working around the house a lot. Since I'm multitasking, I only like to use one side at a time so I can still hear my family. This headset allows me to do that with ease since the semi rigid frame fits around my head and stays in place. I can easily adjust either side on or off my ear. This inexpensive headset even has controls on board that work well. I've bought my fair share of cheap Bluetooth headsets in the past and have often been disappointed.

" 0:55 Mins High quality toys are great, especially when they are as creative as PicassoTiles! My 3 year old daughter already took these and started playing with them even without the PicassoTiles. This item includes 2 PicassoTile cars that roll smoothly and can be linked together. The magic in this set lies in the magnets built into the car truck flat bed.

" 1:56 Mins Pros:+Great sound quality+Comfortable and stylish+Good adjustment+Folds into itself for more compact travel+BT or optional 3.5MM wired+Onboard controls and Mic+Touch sensitive controls!+NFC pairing!+Comes with carrying pouch, 3.5MM cable, and MicroUSB cableCons:-Learning curve to use all these features!The SB270 headset offers exceptional features and value for the price category. I was surprised how comfortable they were even after wearing them for a few hours. The padding around the ears is very soft, but offers a good amount of noise isolation that you expect from this style of headphones. There is also soft padding on the frame itself that you can't really see in the product images. Check out my video and you can get a better sense of what I'm talking about. Sound quality is great with this headset for both calls and music. They provide more bass and overall range than any other bluetooth headset I have. I love the fact that I can plug in 3.5mm cables and use these in the standard wired fashion if I need to. Everything folds down very easily and fits into a carrying pouch. Turning the headset on and off is very easy. The same is true for pairing via Bluetooth. This headset even has NFC pairing, which I failed to mention in the video.

"Pros:+Thin and light+Bright display+MicroSD slot+OTG MicroUSB port (Can charge too!)+Charging port (frees up MicroUSB)+All controls on one side+Front and rear camera+BluetoothCons:-Main charging port is not USB (would prefer 2 USB)-Rear speaker placement blocks sound when laid flatThis is a budget tablet featuring Android 5.1.1. It's not meant to take on any flagship or even mid level tablets on the market. In it's budget category, it's an amazing tablet providing a large 10.1 inch multi touch point display. The resolution of 1024x600 is good for this class. It provides a great ratio for watching widescreen movies. It's powered by a Quad Core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU (4X1.3 GHZ) which is plenty fast for your basic tablet use. Most apps don't utilize multiple cores, but the experience is good with this tablet. For all your standard media consumption apps, it handles them with ease. Gaming is another story and I wouldn't advise this to be use for any 3D intensive games. 16GB storage is fairly standard these days and is plenty for most. However, this tablet features a MicroSD card slot which allows you to expand the storage at your desire! Even better is the OTG MicroUSB port that allows you to connect a variety of devices to this tablet. The MicroUSB port can also charge the device, but it has a dedicated charging port which is good and bad. It's great because it frees up the MicroUSB port, but bad that it uses a proprietary cable to charge. I wish it came with two MicroUSB ports instead! I really like that all the controls are on one side of the tablet. I don't have to feel around the different edges to get to different controls. The cameras on this tablet are great just to have. They aren't going to be as good as what we have on our phones these days, but it works perfectly for skype and other purposes. The bluetooth works well and as expected. All devices pair quickly and easily. One annoyance was the speaker position being on the rear of the device. When you lay the tablet flat, sounds become muted. Make sure you prop this tablet up when listening to anything! I ran some benchmarks for those that are interested. Please see the pictures I provided.

" 2:36 Mins These is a great bluetooth headset that provides a lot of bang for your buck. They are a lot smaller than I expected from the product pictures. Thats a good thing. The sound quality is good, better than I would expect for this price category. What surprised me the most was how well they fit being a semi rigid design. I use headsets while I'm working around the house a lot. Since I'm multitasking, I only like to use one side at a time so I can still hear my family. This headset allows me to do that with ease since the semi rigid frame fits around my head and stays in place. I can easily adjust either side on or off my ear. This inexpensive headset even has controls on board that work well. I've bought my fair share of cheap Bluetooth headsets in the past and have often been disappointed. I'm glad to have found this headset. They fold down very compactly and even come with a small carrying pouch.

"This is my second pair of hiking poles. These are made of aluminum and my first set was made of carbon fiber. For the same wall thickness, carbon fiber is supposed to be lighter, however, both sets feel like they weigh the same in my hand. In other words, the VOROSY poles feel very light for being aluminum alloy.The poles feel very sturdy. There's a rubber attachment for easier terrain or if you want to add extra shock absorbency. Underneath the rubber attachment is a steel tip that provides extra traction for more challenging terrain. There's also a disc attachment that could be used for softer terrain such has soft dirt, snow, or sand.The built-in spring anti-shock system is a neat feature that will help prevent fatigue during long hikes. The grips feel like your standard foam grips with an adjustable wrist strap. The poles can extend from 25.5"" all the way to 53"", so it should work for most folks.

"Pros:+3 coil design = reliable charging+Sturdy portrait mode charging+LED charging indicator+Rubber feet to prevent slippingCons:-LED always onWireless chargers have become main stream now and I have a few to base my review on. I prefer the portrait style wireless chargers because they are the most reliable. When you place your phone on the device, gravity keeps it at the perfect position for charging. I have a few flat chargers and if you don't place them on properly, the charging stops. This design prevents that from happening in most cases. This charger also has 3 charging coils to provide a strong consistent wireless charge with my Galaxy S6. It registers immediately and stays charging the entire time. The LED indicator light stays lit even when the phone isn't charging. This is good and bad. It's good because you can quickly find the charger at night. You pop your phone on and the light changes colors indicating charge. However, I prefer the LED light only to come on when the unit is charging. Personal preference that doesn't impact its use.

"Good case that fits well. The kick stand is the primary reason I wanted this case and it works as you would expect. There's a slight cutout on the bottom edge that lets you grab the kickstand. It supports the massive phone with no issues, but only in landscape mode. It wasn't intended for portrait mode standing, so nothing to complain about there. The two piece design makes the fit very snug and will hopefully protect the phone from drops. The clear case allows you to see the edge plus' back but does add quite a bit of shine to it. Not much you can do about that when you want a clear case though. All the cut outs are appropriately placed allowing easy access to all buttons and features.

" 1:13 Mins Great product. Fairly easy to install. You might want a helping hand since the large decal comes rolled up, making it slightly hard to apply evenly. I had to readjust a few times, using a level and my head to hold things in place! It's basically a giant vinyl sticker. The material is nice and thick and is much stickier than expected! I applied this to a painted wall (flat or eggshell, I can't remember the exact paint. It was definitely not semi-gloss or gloss) without issue. It's not gonna fall down. I really had to pull to remove it while I realigned. I went back and took a video after seeing some of the poor reviews here to give you a better example. High quality image as well.

"Pros:+2 high speed USB charging ports+Keeps your standard grounded outlets+built-in safety feature for each AC outlet+Easy to installCons:-NoneThese replacement receptacles are great. I have a few of their other products and they are all high quality. This one is basically the same thing, but saves a couple bucks by omitting the faceplates. Since the other receptacles came with extra faceplates, I just took the screwed one to install with this receptacle. Install was simple. Just turn off power at the circuit breaker for safety.

We installed this at our business guest reception room. It really cleans up the place while adding convenient charging ports for multiple devices. We don't have to leave chargers plugged into the wall (limited to two charger) or have a messy array of cables (power strip + chargers).

"This 2 in 1 pacifier clip is a great idea! My twin daughters use pacifiers, so we've always had tether clips to keep them off the ground. We also have a few silicone necklaces and chew toys to keep them entertained. Combine all of that together and you get this item! The colorful silicone pieces immediately grabbed their attention and they loved it! I will have to get another to stop them from fighting over it. The pacifier end is slightly different than what I'm used to. What you have is a snap and a ribbon. When I first removed the clip from the package, I thought it wouldn't fit my pacifiers (Soothies). Then I realized you it would still work. The steps are simple:1 - Unsnap the button2 - Fold the ribbon lengthwise (keep the buttons on top of each other, but unsnapped)3 - Thread the ribbon through any hole4 - Bring the unbuttoned end through the loop (folded ribbon)5 - Snap buttons back togetherThe ribbon seems slightly too short, but it works.

I won't go into the endless possibilities a Smart TV box such as this provides. Know that this smart TV box runs Android 4.4, grants you access to the internet and Play store, and already comes loaded with XBMC for a more mature media browsing experience. It has MicroSD card slot and also accepts 4 host USB devices. So in its simplest form, you could throw movies, music, or pictures onto a MicroSD card or USB drive and be ready to go with this device without any internet at all. Since it has a built in media player and the option to use KODI/XBMC, you just select the files and go. The 4 host USB ports allow you to connect USB wireless mice, keyboards, etc. without any fuss. Check the pictures for an example. I connected a wireless mouse to the USB port and my mouse instantly appeared on my TV. I was surprised that all the mouse buttons worked properly. The back and forward shortcut buttons worked as well as the scroll wheel. It even has Bluetooth for more expansion options. If you plan to use this for browsing the web, you'll want to get a wireless keyboard to make the typing experience more pleasant. Just like typical Android, you have an onscreen keyboard, but it's a very slow process using the remote or mouse.

"Pros:+Compact+3 AC outlets and 3 USB ports!+1 high powered USB port for 2.1 Amps+Surge protection+On/off switch+Long power cordCons:-Minor gripe, but it would be nice if all 3 USB ports were high powered at 2 Amps each for a total output of 6 Amps.This is a great surge protector that adds USB power outlets to a common layout. You get 3 grounded AC outlets and 3 USB charging ports. This is ideal for travel (in my opinion), but also works well in cleaning up any area by reducing the need for separate USB chargers. I think these are perfect for cruises and travel in countries where electric outlets are scarce. You have a nice long power cord to reach any outlet but grants you access to a lot more outlets where you like. The voltage rating allows this surge protector to work in most countries as long as you have an adapter to fit the outlet.

"This docking station is great for managing drives. It's list of functions aren't lone, it simply allows access to drives and/or cloning them. However, the applications are very useful for average consumers and techies alike. Whether you're replacing computers, expanding storage, or need quick access to drives used for archival, this docking station will serve you well. It doesn't matter if you have a hard drive or an SSD, as long as it's using a SATA connection this docking station will accept it (up to 6TB). You can pull a drive from a system and make quick clones without having to connect to a computer! Just make sure you place the drives in the right slots (A or B) and press the button twice to proceed. The cloning process will begin and show its progress based on the LED percentage. It couldn't be simpler. If you need to make specific changes to certain drives, you can connect the docking station to a computer and have access to both drives. This makes it so easy when you have lots of drives you need to access. It accepts 2.5"" or 3.5"" drives like other docking stations.

It props phones and tablets for the ideal viewing angle while allowing you to charge all your devices. For my setup, I charge my tablet, phone, and portable battery pack. Sometimes I need to charge up my bluetooth headset, which still works with the extra USB port on the back. The best thing about this charger is the Qualcomm certified Quick Charge 2.0 USB charging port on the front. This charges my Samsung Galaxy S6 up FAST. It registers as fast charging on my phone and works really well. It's a nice compact setup that is great to keep things organized and charged.

"Pros:+High quality finish+built-in safety feature for each AC outlet+2 high speed USB charging ports+2 face plates for optional screwless look+Easy to installCons:-NoneExcellent quality with all the safety features you want if you are replacing an outlet. Not only does it add child tamper resistant AC outlets, but you also get 2 high speed USB charging ports. My home was built right before tamper resistant outlets became standard in this area so I really love this new design where the tamper resistant feature is built in. I don't have to waste money on expensive child safe outlet protectors that can pose a choking hazard or are just so difficult to use. These outlets have a plastic cover inside that retracts when a plug is inserted on both sides. When you remove the plug, the plastic cover inside goes back in place blocking access. It works very well. The two USB outlets make for a very clean device charging outlet as well and these are high speed outlets with a combined 4.0 Amp output!

"Definitely get a size or two up. I ordered other clothing from Leward and their sizing runs on the smaller side than what I typically buy in the US. Thankfully, the size up works well for me. I typically wear small for undershirts and ordered medium here. It fit very snugly but works well in shaping my body. There is a unique elastic weaving pattern (pictured) sewed around the stomach area that really tightens up against your body. I'm not used to it yet so it wasn't exactly comfortable but it really helps define my figure. The material is very stretchy and held up well after washing.

"Pros:+4 USB outlets+1 universal outlet+long power cord+wrap around cord design and travel pouch+Compact designCons:-Charging rates could be improvedThis is a great travel charger. While there are many things I could add to the wishlist of things it doesn't have, I'll focus on what it has and how it performs. There are 4 USB outlets for charging. I believe that is the primary function of this charger and it does that pretty well. I tested the charging outlets with a Portapow V2 usb charging meter and the highest output I recorded was about 1.60 Amps for my Galaxy S5. I have seen up to 1.91 Amps while charging this phone, so this charger has some room for improvement there. However, that doesn't concern me too much based on how I intend to use this charger and how I believe many others will. This is designed primarily for travel and when I travel I only charge my devices at night. I'm not hanging out in the hotel room to use the charger so overall charging speeds is not a big concern here. I charge using portable power banks when I'm out. This charger will allow me to charge 4 devices overnight which is impressive given how compact the device is. I really like the fact that it provides 4 outlets as well as 1 universal AC outlet! The long power cable is perfect for traveling since outlets are rarely positioned in convenient locations when you travel internationally. This allows me to reach the wall outlet anywhere in the room and still position the charger in a convenient area. The wrap around cord design is nice and works well because the power cord is very thin. If you wrap it neatly, it will snap back in place but I broke the clip rather quickly. Thankfully, it comes with a carrying pouch so I wrap it up and toss it in the pouch along with 4 USB cables for charging.

"I love using carabiners as a keychain organizer. This set in particular is inexpensive and the perfect size. They are small yet fully functional. The spring is strong enough to prevent key rings from accidentally coming off. Carabiners are perfect because they are so simple and compact. The no bulk design is ideal for keeping a bunch of keys from getting out of hand. The best part about carabiners is when I need to remove a key, they can be popped out with ease.

"Great combination solar charger/portable battery pack. It's a great concept and works pretty well in action.Pros:+Compact+Built-in solar charger+power indicator light+power switch (also battery check)+Can be charged via microUSB as wellCons:-Included cables are junk-Charging rate is averageThe overall size is its greatest asset. It packs away nicely into any backpack pocket for hiking or any activity. It fits easily into any of my pant/short pockets as well (pockets on male clothing). All you need is this charger and a cable to have continuous power when you're away from traditional power sources. It won't allow you to use your devices all day, but it will recharge you part of the way after a day in the sunlight. This is perfect as an emergency charger. As soon as the charger's solar panels receive some light, it will start charging the battery pack. This is indicated by the 4 blue LED's. There is no way to know how fast its recharging from the sun. I tested the charger using a Portapow V2 USB charging meter and confirmed the included cables are junk. Yes, they come with a variety of tips for various devices, but they charge very slow. I wouldn't throw them out just yet. They work, just really slow so maybe just leave it in the car for emergencies. The included cables maxed out at 0.40 Amps. When I switched to my test cables, the charger maxed out at 1.30 Amps. This is rated at a 2 Amp output but doesn't quite reach that mark. I typically see 1.6-1.92 Amps when charging my Galaxy S5 (screen off).  I still think this is a great charger for emergencies, hiking, or just to take advantage of free power around the house if you set it by a window every day. I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review.Update 11/9/15: Make sure you properly angle this to allow sunlight to directly hit the panels. I had it sitting flat on a window ledge with light coming in at an angle. After two days of moderate sun, it only charged up to 2 bars and barely 2. After I started using the charger it dropped down to 1 bar fast. Readjusted its placement for charging and will update again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BL2XS8TH6GOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010XDFS3C#wasThisHelpful","R2BL2XS8TH6GOK","A3OK0F7FB6Z4B5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OK0F7FB6Z4B5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:+Thin and light+Bright display+MicroSD slot+OTG MicroUSB port (Can charge too!)+Charging port (frees up MicroUSB)+All controls on one side+Front and rear camera+BluetoothCons:-Main charging port is not USB (would prefer 2 USB)-Rear speaker placement blocks sound when laid flatThis is a budget tablet featuring Android 5.1.1. It's not meant to take on any flagship or even mid level tablets on the market. In it's budget category, it's an amazing tablet providing a large 10.1 inch multi touch point display. The resolution of 1024x600 is good for this class. It provides a great ratio for watching widescreen movies. It's powered by a Quad Core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU (4X1.3 GHZ) which is plenty fast for your  basic tablet use. Most apps don't utilize multiple cores, but the experience is good with this tablet. For all your standard media consumption apps, it handles them with ease. Gaming is another story and I wouldn't advise this to be use for any 3D intensive games. 16GB storage is fairly standard these days and is plenty for most. However, this tablet features a MicroSD card slot which allows you to expand the storage at your desire! Even better is the OTG MicroUSB port that allows you to connect a variety of devices to this tablet. The MicroUSB port can also charge the device, but it has a dedicated charging port which is good and bad. It's great because it frees up the MicroUSB port, but bad that it uses a proprietary cable to charge. I wish it came with two MicroUSB ports instead! I really like that all the controls are on one side of the tablet. I don't have to feel around the different edges to get to different controls. The cameras on this tablet are great just to have. They aren't going to be as good as what we have on our phones these days, but it works perfectly for skype and other purposes. The bluetooth works well and as expected. All devices pair quickly and easily. One annoyance was the speaker position being on the rear of the device. When you lay the tablet flat, sounds become muted. Make sure you prop this tablet up when listening to anything! I ran some benchmarks for those that are interested. Please see the pictures I provided.

"Very impressive headphones by Sentey. They come packaged in a sturdy zippered shell case that is soft on the inside. The headphones collapse to make them easier to travel with. The headphones are very high quality in finish and the sound quality (most important).Fit and FinishThese headphones really look and feel high quality. There are metal accents all around, but all integrated in such a way to provide great adjustability. You can adjust each side independently of the other and the adjustments are smooth yet stay in place. Each side of the headphones can be rotated for listening by placing the headphones up to your ear instead of wearing them (imagine what a DJ does sometimes). The foam on the headphones is super soft and comfortable. It's very thick and compresses easily. They are very comfortable for extended use and wear. There is also a thick piece of foam padding on top of the headphones for added comfort. The 3.5mm audio cable is a flat tangle free style that can be unplugged from the headphones.Sound QualityThe most important aspect when it comes to headphones. The Sentey headphones are simply great! If you haven't used full sized headphones lately you're in for a treat. Earbud style headphones simply don't compare to full sized headphones such as the Sentey. You hear things you didn't know existed if you were using earbuds. The Sentey headphones produce very even tones across the board while providing good bass without being over the top. It's the bass you want to hear, not the type you simply feel.

"I've been through plenty of Pocket Hose ULTRA Telebrands 50FT Expandable Garden Hose AMBER TIP's and they just don't last longer than a season. I'm fairly careful using them to. Out of 4, only one formed a leak in the hose itself. The other 3 I have became damaged at the hose connection ends because they are made of cheap plastic. I tried the Pocket Hose brand original, ultra model, and 2 similarly constructed hoses I picked up locally. DAOTS addresses the issue I experienced by using quality brass connectors at each end! The connectors are where the magic is. They won't warp through extended use or from heat and they also will take a beating compared to cheap plastic. This hose comes with a flow control connector that IS  made of plastic, but can be removed and used without. It also comes with a multifunction hose nozzle that works well, but I don't expect it to last as long as the hose itself because of it's plastic construction. You also get an extra o-ring in case you lose yours or it becomes brittle after a season. I will have to update this review after extended use. It's brand new now and has been working great for the past week! Please check out the close up pictures of the hose material and brass connectors!

"The title for this sunshade made me expect a larger shade than what arrived, but it is still the best one I've used yet. I can only guess that any larger and it might not work in other vehicles. I'm using this in a 2014 Honda Odyssey. I already have a ""jumbo"" sunshade made of similar material and design. However, my old one is a two piece design, while the X-Shade is one single piece. They both collapse in similar fashion, but the X-Shade is connected in between the collapsible discs. The X-shade is a better design in my opinion. It provides better coverage and easier placement. The material also appears to have a tighter weave to it, blocking out more light. Take a look at the pictures I took. My old 2 piece shade doesn't fit right in my Odyssey. If I place the old shades vertically, I have to cram it into the windshield area and it bulges leaving gaps. It also dug into the seal and pulled up some foam insulation at the bottom of the windshield one time. Since then, I installed my old shades horizontally and pulled down the sun visor to help keep it in place. Again, it wasn't an ideal fit as you can see in the picture. The X-shade is a much better fit for my vehicle. The extra flaps help block out more light too.

"Wow! Accessory overload for the GoPro! With a single purchase you can have almost every mount you will need or want to use with your GoPro. I love that a branded case is included in this package. You get a Vivitar zippered case that you can shove everything into or neatly organize. Your call, but it's a tough job since you get so many items! The case is a somewhat hard shell exterior  and opens up into a clam style case. Inside you'll find one elastic mesh side to store large items. The other side has a foam material with cutouts that you can replace with an item. The foam is somewhat cheaply made though and doesn't conform well to the case. It seems like it's almost something you throw away if it didn't have the cutouts. Still, its a great way to keep everything contained. You get your standard selfie stick to give you greater recording angles, headstrap, chest strap, wrist strap, floaters, and all the mounting accessories.

"How to make an outlet better? Replace it with a Topgreener USB charging outlet! This outlet receptacle is great. It is high quality and comes with all the important safety certifications so you don't have to worry about it since it's wired up 24/7. Installation is very simple and it even comes with 2 faceplates (one standard and one screwless that snaps on). There are two primary reasons to get this outlet receptacle, the child-safe tamper resistant outlets and the 2 high speed USB charging ports built in. If you don't want a clutter of power strips and chargers overtaking your home, simply replace an existing outlet with this outlet! You will still have access to two AC outlets, but you gain 2 high speed USB charging ports without having to sacrifice an outlet for a charger. The USB outlets were tested with a Portapow V2 usb charging meter and I verified they both charge my devices at the maximum rate allowed. The charging rate didn't fluctuate as I added additional devices to the other port or using the AC outlet. The child safety tamper resistant feature is nice as well.

"The Ipow car mount has all the right features in a compact design. It's attractive and doesn't require a lot of space for the suction or mount itself.Pros:+Compact design+Easy one-handed use+Strong 2 step suction+Adjustable (2 pivots)+AttractiveCons:-NoneThe suction is the newer design commonly found on all the great car mounts. It's a sticky gel material that conforms to textured and smooth surfaces. The stickiness alone can hold the mount in place when the car isn't moving. Press the mount down more and the sticky gel pad is suctioned in place. Next you flip the lever down to increase the suction strength to firmly mount it in place.

" 0:55 Mins This multi-angle stand is pretty handy. It's one of those items you probably won't have a burning need for, but when you use it, you come to love it. There's nothing more annoying to me than propping my phone or tablet up against an object only to have it fall flat on its back. This simple device solves that problem and goes further by offering two ideal viewing angles. You can place your device horizontally or vertically while maintaining its stability. I wish the rubber pads were a little more grippy, but they work well enough during my testing. The device slot is also created to securely hold your device so you can't really fit tablets with bulky cases in here.

I think the market has finally reached a point where we can get such a high performing wireless charger at such a low cost. This wireless charger works just as well as my other single coil wireless charging pads. It works effortlessly and even through my dual layer Spigen case on my S6! There is a small ring of rubber/silicone on top to help keep your device in place from light bumps. I can't test the charger using my USB charging meter, but just looking on my phone it immediately picks up the wireless charge and indicates the expected estimated time to fully charge.

"High quality Apple lightning cable that's MFI certified. I got the short 6 in version to help clean up my charging area. I have a number of devices I'll leave charging at the table using a USB charging hub. What I can't stand is the mess of cables required when charging multiple devices. With this 6 inch cord, I don't have to deal with the extra mess. This cable has a very specific use and I think it works perfectly for situations where you will just leave a device to charge. If you want to pick it up and use it while charging, get a longer cable. The Zerolemon lightning cable is well made and works great! It charges all my Apple devices as they should and is quite a bit beefier than the frail original Apple lightning cables that die all too often. I hope this one lasts a long time but I will update if I experience anything out of the ordinary.

"This surge protector is a powerful beast! I think this will become the standard for surge protectors in a few years. If it doesn't, it should be. It's just so useful in today's world where we have so many devices that charge via USB.Pros:+Surge protection+6 AC outlets+8!!!! USB ports (4 fast charging, 4 standard)+Long power cord+On/off switchCons:-Could make better use of space for optimal socket placementI wish the power cord was detachable, but that's a minor complaint. This is not a surge protector I bring around. It will stay in place charging a boatload of devices. I tested the high output USB ports using a Portapow V2 USB meter and confirmed it charged as it should. The 8 USB port model has some wasted space (observation from the exterior only). I wish there were more room between the AC outlets to accommodate power bricks. However, with 6 outlets and 8 dedicated USB ports, I'm more than happy with how many devices I can charge at once!

"When I this mud mask came in I thought I had dj vu. It has so many similarities to other highly rated dead sea mud masks on Amazon.

"Pros:+WIDE mirror, I can see my babies clearly+Clear (no distortion)+Stable+Wide range of adjustment (thanks to ball mount pivot)+Secure and easy to strap to any headrest+Easy to detach only mirrorCons:-NoneThis backseat baby mirror is the absolute best design out there! I recently got the exact same design from another company and I'm not entirely sure who came up with it first. In any case, they have a winner with this mirror! I have gone through MANY MANY backseat mirrors and they've all left me frustrated for one reason or another. This mirror just does what it's intended to do and it does that very well. It's highly adjustable, allowing you to clearly see your child in almost any configuration.  It's quick and easy to install and can be detached from the base if needed (I imagine if you're going on a long drive without your child and need rear visibility). Anyways, check out the pictures of my setup and the setup I replaced. I have a few different mirrors pictured to show how poorly they adjust.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JI924CNBIBYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YK46RCC#wasThisHelpful","R1JI924CNBIBYC","A3OK0F7FB6Z4B5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OK0F7FB6Z4B5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These travel bottles are quite easy to use and fill. They have little suction cupsd that allow you to have them in the hotel shower for easy and accessible access to your body wash, shampoo and conditioner just like you would have at home. This is very convenient when you have a long stay at a hotel.These bottles are TSA approved and I had no problem carrying them with me on my carryon while going through security. I love that these bottles come in a little bag allowing me to stay organized and i am able to add my toothbrush and toothepaste to the pouch without any issues. I did not have a simgle leak in the pouch or in my bag while using this set. They are quite durible and do not simply pop open unless you want it to.I love the cheerful colors and because the bottles are different colors it allows me to remember what is in what without having to pull out the permanent marker to write what is in each bottle which, my husband had to do with his travel bottles since all of his were white. He should have bought these ones like me.lolI would definitely recommend.

"This necklace,bracelet and earring set is beautiful. It has helped me turn a simple cardigan and tank top into a very classy outfit. It is colorful enough too match every outfit. Which is something that i love about this set. I like having my jewelry match and this set allowed me to not have to waste time trying to find the perfect matching piece to make the jewelry complete. I love everything that allows me to save time.What I love most about the necklace is that the chain actually hangs a little low and it doesnt look cheap. Often times a company makes a beautiful pendant but the chain looks like it would break if the wind blows too hard.lol. Thankfully, that is not the case with this necklace chain. It is quite beautiful and i have already received compliments about my necklace.The bracelet is equally gorgeous and has a clasp so that it doesnt pop off easily. Additionally, it was very well made and it has a nice sparkle when it catches the sunlight. I do wish that it was a tad bit bigger i have fat wrists and it is a little snug however, its not uncomfortable it just doesnt slide down my arm like some bracelets tend to do.These earrings are also very classy and beautiful. They are simple and understated. I love that they aren't dangling earrings and that they are simple and do not get caught up in my hair. The truly bring the whole outfit together.I would definitely recommend this jewelry set. It can dress up and outfit as well as bring and outfit together. The necklace makes a beautiful chest piece and my bracelet sweetens the deal for me since this comes with all the pieces you would need to accessorize your outfit.I purchased at a promotional price for the sole purpose of this unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21K4CX0TTR384/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTDXP2C#wasThisHelpful","R21K4CX0TTR384","A2ECS7CKQTW9RT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ECS7CKQTW9RT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That was definitely very thughtful of them. I have purchased other flameless candles in the pas and i had to purchase batteries for them before i was able to enjoy them. These came with the batteries already installed all we had to do was remove the plastic tab and flip the switch.Since our wedding we have enjoyed using these at parties at  the house and they are wonderful for christmas pinner.

"I love this ipad case. I have had it for 2 weeks now and I am quite happy with the way that it protects my ipad and makes it easy for me to enjoy a movie. I love the gold design and that the clasp is magnetic and I do not have to feel like i might harm my ipad by trying to fasten a clasp.In the 2 weeks i have had this case i have had nothing but compliments when using this case in public. The classy gold design seems to be an eye catcher and I have told several people that i got this case from amazon and they are all surprised.

"I'm probably a pretty good audience for this book: I'm a professional photographer, I live in New England and I love Vermont. but I'm also always looking for new places to shoot in Vermont. I'm also write the ""Traveling Photographer"" column for Popular Photography and so I'm always looking for interesting places to share with readers.While this book does provide some good ideas, it is somewhat lacking in its concept and execution. For one, it's a pretty thin book--it could easily be doubled, there are tons of places that I've been and shot that aren't mentioned.Also there are almost no useful maps--and non are really specific to the places. There are chapter-opening maps that are very general, but that's about it. In fact, I get the feeling that this text was written a long time ago and then just rebirthed. Any book like this today would have GPS coordinates listed so that people could find exact locations quickly and reliably (granted, not all of a rural state like Vermont is adequately mapped yet, most of it is). I did find some useful thoughts on places, to be sure, but there just aren't enough to justify the price.The photos in the book are adequate at best, but I won't blame that on the photographer. A lot of times a photographer's best work doesn't show up in a book for one reason or another--largely because editors are picking the photos, not the photographer. I am willing to accept that this photographer is better than the book shows. But there are not many photos in this book that would lure me to a place. Open a Sierra Club calendar sometime and you *need* to go to those places is you're a photographer, they are that enticing. The photos in this book just don't have that strength--and they should.The technical information at the front of the book seems a bit out of date to me. He talks about filters a lot, for one, and with everyone using some type of editing program these days, filters are mostly added after the fact. He does say one thing that I love reading and that is that every photo in the book was shot with a tripod--Bravo! The first thing I tell my students is that if you want to see a ten-fold increase in image quality immediately, get and use a good tripod--for ever single shot. I really love that he gives that advice. Digital is barely mentioned in the book (another reason that I suspect this is very old text).So, while the book has some basic places and ideas that are useful and the writing is very pleasant, I think the book could have gone into a lot more depth and covered places like the Northeast Kingdom more. If you're new to shooting in Vermont, buy the book, it's certainly helpful. But if you already know the place a bit, you won't get as much from it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T2RDBVYN5LQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0881505331#wasThisHelpful","R3T2RDBVYN5LQB","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an extremely well made and conveniently-designed case for smaller tablets and it's got me wishing that Verso made a case like this for laptops. Even though the description didn't mention it, I was kind of hoping it would be big enough to accommodate my Fire HDX 8.9 and it's just a tad too small. Oh, well. It does fit my BLU 8.0 tablet/phone perfectly and so that's what I'm using it for--and I'm glad that tablet finally has a safe home.That said, while it is a moderately well-padded case, unfortunately, I don't think that this case by itself offers real protection from breaking tablet glass. It is a nice soft and padded case, but there is no stiff liner in the outer sides that would protect the case against a heavy book in a backpack, for example. If the tablet is already in a protective case, then it would be just fine. My Fire HDX, for instance, is housed in a really rugged protective case and if that would have fit in this case, I'm sure the two would have offered complete protection. So, if you are buying this to shove in a kid's backpack (or perhaps your own suitcase), I would really think about first putting their tablet in a hardshell case--and then seeing if both will fit into this Verso carry case.As far as the construction of this goes, as a soft outer case it's near perfect. You just couldn't ask for a more thoughtfully-designed carry case. There is a small pocket inside (good for a cleaning cloth, perhaps) and a really nice outer pocket in which I have my BLU manual and an extra cleaning cloth. (I don't want to put the a/c charger in there because, again, I wouldn't want that pressing against a tablet. Yes, there is padding, but I'm not sure it would be a good idea to pack a hard charger in with the tablet.So, while I really like this case a great deal, I would not count on it to protect a tablet by itself, but it in conjunction with a hard-shell tablet case, if they both fit, perfect. The inside has a really nice soft-brushed lining that is both attractive and gentle. In most respects, so nicely made, hard not to give it five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21MBULJK5X6ME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010CC96MS#wasThisHelpful","R21MBULJK5X6ME","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's very hard not to like this laptop a great deal considering some of the features that it has and the (to me) astoundingly low price. Compared to a Chromebook, for example, you get a whole lot more computer for a modest jump in price (for the same screen size). The computer has a very solid and professional feel to me and I disagree with a few other reviews that say it has a cheaper feel--I don't find that to be true at all (and I own another ASUS, a K501LX 15.6 Inch, that originally retailed for around three times as much).Perhaps the most important thing for me in a laptop is that it has enough flexibility to integrate well with other toys--and this laptop has a lot of integration flexibility--more so than that K501LX, in fact). For one, it has three different USB ports (one of which I use almost 100% of the time for an Amazon Basics mouse--I am not a trackpad fan, particularly if I'm sitting at a table and have a good mouse surface) and it has HDMI. The HDMI port is an excellent addition because it enables me to plug the laptop into my Epson projector and give slide shows (I teach photography workshops) or even watch a movie--which I did first thing. It also has an SD slot, so you can download photos or sound files quickly.The screen, important to me because I view a lot of photographs (both online galleries of other photographers and my own images) is actually quite good--a much better graphics quality that I was expecting to be honest. Yes, the screen has its limitations, no question, this is not a high-end screen. The screen has a slight warmish cast (you can correct that with a calibrator, I assume) and it has a matte surface, so it doesn't have that great snap that a high-end glossy screen has and it is certainly no match for my Apple retina display (nor should it be at this price). Yes, there is a drop-off if you turn the screen a bit, but I tend to sit right in front of the computer, lol, so it's never an issue.The computer is surprisingly fast, but so far I'm using it mainly to surf and use built-in software features. It's *great* that it came preloaded with Windows 10, by the way. I've yet to install Office and that's got to happen soon so I can use Word (would be great if it shipped with Word, but that's asking a lot) but I don't think Word will run slowly. You can add one 8gig chip to bring it up to 12gigs total, which is probably a good idea if you are gaming. The very first thing I did with this computer was to watch a movie and again, if you were to compare it to a higher-end screen you'd see a difference, but otherwise it's very acceptable--your eyes do get used to whatever screen you're watching provided it's not totally inferior and this is far from that. The speakers are touted by ASUS as being great, but I'd rate them more as adequate and I ended up toying with a small blu tooth speaker (just to test the blu tooth range) and ended up listening to most of the film through that. But again, having blu tooth capability (and you can run a wireless printer, which is nice) is nice, too.The laptop has a solid and substantial feel. The keyboard is actually comfortable, but it's not backlit so you'll need a light in dim situations. But I will say the wrist area is super comfortable and the whole keyboard has a nice feel to it.Overall, I really just wanted this laptop to keep in the den so that I can surf or do some research while I'm watching the tube, or watch a film sitting on the back porch, but I was surprised that it's a more substantial machine than that. I think this would make an excellent laptop for a high school student or anyone that didn't want to invest big bucks into a higher end computer. Based on price, I can't see an obvious reason to give this less than five stars, but of course that must take the affordable nature into consideration. But on the other hand, I can hook this computer up to my Epson projector (or my Vizio TV, for that matter) and my other ASUS lacks HDMI port, so this one actually wins that battle.Hard to believe you can buy laptops today for this price--and just how light and nice this feels compared to laptops only a generation or two ago.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T5O1NOR6E10W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011KFQASE#wasThisHelpful","R2T5O1NOR6E10W","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think that Season 5 of Curb is where the show did two things: it hit its comedic stride and it started to fall apart. Larry David, king of the self-indulgent comics can be the funniest thing on wheels when he's at the top of his game, but he can also drag you down into a pit of inside jokes that are so inside only he understands them. Don't get me wrong, I love this show, I have watched every episode several times, but at times he gets so hung up on minor plot things (and blows them up into giant plot things without substance) that I find myself reaching for the fast-forward button. Too many hospital scenes, for one, and just a bit too much dark humor at times. Still a great series, David is a genius of the highest order and this series kind of lets you look inside his mind and life to a pretty intense degree. Some of it is the funniest stuff you'll ever see, some is not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX9YRWA4CCJ7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006GLMKA0#wasThisHelpful","RX9YRWA4CCJ7V","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally saw this movie in the theater when it first came out and I recall it as being more interesting than it was on my recent viewing. John Cusack is great, as usual, but the storyline is ploddingly slow at first and really never gets into high gear. I compare the grifting aspect to that shown in several David Mamet films (like the Spanish Prisoner, a brilliant movie) and it is just not as interesting or as insightful--Mamet takes you into the con and he lets you see how the cons unravel. Stephen Frears, the director of Grifters, does not; instead he tends to use the cons as a backdrop to a kind of weird mother/son drama. While I found the movie tolerable to watch a second time and Cusack is a joy to watch, I just didn't think the script held up. I'll watch it again though, primarily for some good acting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJ3ROBIPMNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094PNEWS#wasThisHelpful","R1YJ3ROBIPMNT","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried lots of other brands of duct tape and this is the best of them all. Last year I used a roll of this to staple through after I wrapped my screened porch in plastic (I just tacked the plastic in place first, then went over the stapling areas with the tape--worked beautifully. By stapling through the tape it's far less likely that the plastic will rip out in a storm--and I learned the hard way (going out in sub-freezing weather to redo the plastic before a blizzard). (Using 5/16"" T50 staples into pine wood strips, in case anyone is curious, lol.)I find a million uses for this tape and often buy bright colors to put on garden tools so I don't lose them in the grass. How nuts is it that most garden clippers have green or black handles? I also put bright pink tape on my eyeglass cases in case I put them down.

"I really like these towels a great deal and as expensive as they are, I seriously think I would choose them over paper towels in the future. I have always hated paper towels because I feel that we're all wasting trees just to wipe off countertops--and even the best brands just fall apart in a few minutes. Many paper towel brands are now using recycled materials, but we're still tossing out millions of paper towels a day. You start to cook a big meal and you can go through a dozen in no time. Cloth towels are nice, but they get filthy (and smelly) fast and it's just more laundry to do. It may seem like a minor issue to people that don't cook a lot, but I spend a lot of time in the kitchen.So, when these towels arrived, I took one out to test it and decided to see how long I could abuse it before it just fell apart. I first dampened it, wrung it out then wiped down the kitchen counters and it did a good job and not a sign of a tear. So I wiped down the stove (I'm not the neatest cook in the world either, lol), still fine. I then rinsed it quickly and walked around the house and wiped down my office tables, the tops of my computers, several hard drives, cleaned my office phone and then the keyboard. Still, no tears. So, for fun I yanked it hard (it was still pretty wet) expecting that I'd sacrificed it for sure. No tears, nothing. That one towel has been hanging around my home office ever since and it's still using it. Not sure how they'll work cleaning furniture with spray wax yet, but that's next.These towels are obviously designed for and marketed to the food-service industry but I think that Georgia-Pacific would have a lot of success marketing this for home use (particularly if they lower the price a bit or package smaller quantities for home use). You can use one paper towel all afternoon in a kitchen instead of going through half a roll of paper towels. Yes, expensive, no doubt, but there are 150 of these in a box. If you use one a day and toss it out (and you probably won't--I've hung them up to dry and they are fine on the second use) then one box will last you five months. Even if you use two, you're still going to go nearly three months before restocking (compare that to adding paper towels to your shopping list every week).  I'll gladly pay more if I can buy one box that will last me nearly half a year instead of buying those big clunky dozen-roll packages of paper towels that I can never find a place to store. I'm sold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QOMNRVTSSIQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZR9QKS#wasThisHelpful","R1QOMNRVTSSIQ2","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been a professional photographer for more than 40 years and B+W  filters are by far the best filters that I've ever used. I've used virtually every brand (Hoya, Tiffen, Nikon, etc.) and B+W tend to be superior in both optical clarity and in their construction. These filters are made in Germany from Schott glass and they are the only filters that I truly trust not to degrade lens sharpness or to introduce flare from internal reflections. And what is the point of spending premium dollars on a lens only to stick an inferior piece of glass in front of it? B+W filters are carefully coated on all sides (the filter actually consists of two pieces of glass in a rotating mount) and things like glare and off-color transmission are not a factor.If you're considering a polarizing filter you probably already know what they are used for: to reduce surface reflections in any non-metallic surface (they won't reduce reflections coming off most painted metals, like a car fender, etc.). They work beautifully at eliminating reflections from things like glass (so you can shoot a store window display from the outside, for example, which I do a lot when traveling), water (kind of cool to be able to photograph a trout in a stream or goldfish in a garden pond and remove the surface glare), wet autumn foliage, etc. The filters work best when you are at 90-degrees from the sun and not at all when the sun is behind your or directly in front of you and because they are in a circular mount you can adjust the intensity of the effect. The physics behind how they work is a bit intense but essentially they block certain superfluous rays of reflected light that desaturate colors (blue sky) and cause surface glare.One thing that is mentioned less is that polarizing filters are far superior to ""haze/UV"" filters when it comes to reducing atmospheric haze in landscape photos. It's kind of a miracle to stand there and turn the filter and watch haze simply vanish. They work particularly well at darkening blue skies in landscapes (though you have to be careful that you don't over-saturate them to the point of getting nearly black skies). Color saturation (fall foliage is a good example) can be super enhanced using a polarizing filter. Because you can increase saturation in editing so easily these days, there are fewer times when I'll use a polarizing filter for that, but they are still important for removing or controlling reflections. And you can use them to enhance saturation in the camera, particularly if you don't do your own printing or editing.The claim that B+W makes that these particular polarizing filters increase light transmission seems to me to be true, but it's a kind of tricky thing to quantify. Typically the light loss from a polarizing filter is about 1 2/3 stops and I think you are probably gaining that 2/3 stop (maximum) back. There's really no way to measure unless you're comparing two filters in the exact same situation at the same moment. The amount of light loss really doesn't matter in terms of exposure (particularly if you're using a tripod because you can just keep the same aperture and slow the shutter down, so you're not messing with depth of field changes), but it does help keep the viewfinder brighter which is nice. The coating on these filters appears also to be 100-percent neutral--I'm detecting no color shift whatsoever (and you do see a color cast with some filters, no question).I really think if you're going to keep a lens for a while (or have multiple lenses of the same diameter) and you need a polarizing filter, you're better off spending the extra money on B+W filter and taking good care of it. A filter will last forever if you take care of it, so it's worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R275ZM6W9PWVRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PH4V9CM#wasThisHelpful","R275ZM6W9PWVRQ","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this is one of the finest and most original motion pictures ever made.  The movie is based on (somewhat loosely) the book Shoeless Joe, though much of the movie's plot was created by Hollywood writers.I'm not sure why this movie touches me so deeply, but it does. While purely a fantasy, there are elements of reality that are beautifully portrayed: the father and son relationship, for one. Kevin Costner is fantastic, as is James Earl Jones. And Burt Lancaster--what can you say? Possibly the greatest actor that ever lived and his role in this, while short, is brilliant. Fabulous.Lots of special features on the blu ray, too, despite what I read in other reviews.

So far I love everything about this: it's very simple to set up, seems to be made relatively well and you can have it up, running and planted in 10 minutes or less. I think it was a great idea to make it so simple and while I'm still waiting for germination (I'll update in a few days, according to the set-up guide germination can happen in as fast as a few days for some plants). I'm going to keep a log next to the unit to track when the pods were started, when they germinated, room temps, etc.I'm a pretty active outdoor gardener, but one of the things I miss (I'm in Connecticut) is that when early October comes, most of my garden is past--the last tomatoes are on the vine, the cucumbers are done, all I have left are some squash and a few herbs. What I'm really looking forward to growing in this are the herbs that came with it. Nothing, but nothing, beats having fresh basil in your kitchen to cook with and up until now I've had to grow winter basil under a Rube Goldberg mess of lights and pots and trays. I really love this idea and if it works, I'll probably try a larger one.Here are some good points:* There is a light timer that keep the light on for 16 hours a day and it comes on at the same time every day (you can modify the start/stop time, but the duration is always 16 hours).* There is a water-fill line in the small tank so you know where/when to add water.* The liquid nutrients are poured in through a front well so it's convenient, even if there are plants growing..* There is a timer/light at the top that reminds you, every 14 days, to add nutrients.* It's very simple to assemble: basically you just insert the grow bulb into the housing, set the tray in place, add water, raise the light to the correct height for the plants you're growing and plant your pods. There are nutrient instructions in the kit.According to the very simple quick setup guide the unit should be placed away from additional light sources or areas of hot (coffee pot) or cold (drafty window) and the optimal temps are, like outdoor plants, dependent on the type of plant: lettuce, for example, likes cooler temps and peppers and tomatoes like warmer temps. I keep my house pretty cool in winter (not by choice, lol), so I will probably tend toward more cool-temp loving plants.Cons? I think the pods are pretty expensive and I hope they come down in price as more and more people do this. You can,apparently buy empty cones and sponges and start your own seeds, but I'm not sure yet how much they cost. I'm really hoping the bulb does not contain mercury (in case of breakage) but I have *not* seen it mentioned. I believe I read that the bulb lasts for six months, but I have not priced replacement bulbs yet. I'm doing this as much for the experience as the produce, however, so I will endure some of the costs and just consider them the cost of a new hobby.Overall, very satisfied and *very* psyched to be able to grow hydroponically in winter. I am a photographer and will document growth, etc. and post photos with updates.Update: Since my original review (five stars), I have decided to downgrade this by one star because it is *not* an LED light, it's a CFL and it is described as an LED. CFLs contain mercury and are potentially dangerous if broken. CFLs are also more costly to run 16 hours a day than LEDs, I think. Given a choice, I would always choose an LED option. I am still extremely happy with the product, the bulb is my only complaint. It's housed pretty safely, however, so probably not a danger, but just keep that in mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KLS3NL7RNEW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NBJMWW#wasThisHelpful","R3KLS3NL7RNEW0","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Buying batteries in bulk is the way to go. When you compare prices (even against other Duracell packs) of four or eight batteries against 24, these 24-packs (and larger) are a bargain. Also, if I go to the store, I always cheap out and just buy four or eight--and then regret that cheapness later. Since I started buying larger packs, I never seem to run out. These are packed as six four-packs of AA batteries.I am a photographer and go through a lot of AA batteries in accessory flash units (Nikon SB 900 currently) and while there is no question that Lithium batteries are longer lasting than these, they are also super expensive. I hate just tossing batteries away when they are used up, but that seems to be the current reality.In any even, I think these are very reliable batteries, affordable and while not the best batteries made, are very good and long lasting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EUO7SAV9JSVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009V2QX#wasThisHelpful","R3EUO7SAV9JSVP","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very soft and gentle blankets and, as far as I know, they are the first fabric made from bamboo that I have ever handled. They are so soft, in fact, that they feel as though they've already been washed and dried a few times, they have that sort of nice ""just out of the dryer"" feel. They are on the thin side, no question, but I think that babies are far better off (and more comfortable) in a blanket that maintains their own body heat, or even releases some heat, rather than heats them up to much, particularly when sleeping.The patterns are nice but very faint (and I'm not crazy about the gray stripes), also. I suspect the patterns will fade a bit more as they are washed repeatedly, but no matter, they look pretty.The one thing I'm a bit confused about (just in a curious sense) is the actual fabric content and why they are called ""muslin"" when in fact they are a blend of 70-percent  ""viscose bamboo"" and 30-percent ""cotton."" Muslin is traditionally a 100-percent cotton weave and cotton comes from cotton plants. To confuse matters more the Amazon description (not the box) says ""70-percent Rayon."" Rayon is actually a regenerated cellulose-source fabric, typically made from plant or wood fibers and is actually considered a partially-synthethic fabric (because it's manufactured, but it is still from natural materials)--in this case, bamboo. Plenty of room on the packaging, I'm surprised that since the fabric is so nice and cushy, they didn't describe its unique bamboo source more. (I've do photography for the textile industry which is the only reason I've read about this.) I think it might actually be an interesting selling point.At any rate, you won't be disappointed in the softness of these blankets, and they will feel very natural and very comfortable to your baby, I'm sure. Rayon weaves tend to last a very long time through many wash cycles also. And the size of the blankets (40 x 40-inches) is very generous.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z3T5RTGIH374/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100O6AZE#wasThisHelpful","R2Z3T5RTGIH374","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm genuinely impressed with two things about the HTST9: both the audio quality and the surprising ease of set up. When it arrived I stared at the box for two days fearful I was going to be involved in yet another complex set-up process but it wasn't. Basically all that you have to do is to connect the bar (via HDMI) to your TV and then reroute your other HDMI devices (in my case a Sony blu ray player and a cable box) to the bar and then plug in the power cords for the bar and the subwoofer and you're done with the wiring aspect. The rest is just the typical menu/language set up and getting to know the remote (more about the remote below).This is really my third generation of sound devices for TV/movies and it is clearly the hands-down winner.  My first system was a Panasonic surrounded-sound (seven speaker) system that is now pretty much antique but was surprisingly great in sound quality. The trouble was that it was a part of an integrated dvd player/system and the dvd player was horrible. But there is definitely an advantage (even over this great sound bar) to having speakers physically placed around the room--no question, that type of system rocks. My next system (and I use it in my bedroom and it's great) is a Bose Solo 15 Series II. For a small and pretty affordable ($429) and unobtrusive system, that Bose machine produces superb sound.This Sony sound bar, however, while it lacks that ""behind your head"" quality that a surround-sound system has, is still incredible--and I mean incredible. I have it in a 14x20' den and while it won't blow the roof off, it comes close. It's such a different experience to watch a blu ray disc on this that you feel like you've entered another era in sound quality. You simply can't imagine the difference from those cheesy (in my case Vizio--but the TV picture is great) built-in TV speakers. I'm of an age where I've been ""losing"" the dialogue on most TV shows and many movies for several years. This bar has restored a lot of sound I didn't even realize was there. (I noticed watching ""The Middle"" that I can actually hear Brick's whispers, lol). In fact, I'm glad I live in a house and not an apt or I have a feeling I'd be getting calls. There is nothing I love more than watching movies in the middle of the night on weekends and this sound system just rocks. It actually scared me a bit with the first movie I watched (""The Boat that Rocked,"" great film) because the music was so powerful. But the dialogue was clear, defined and Sony has done a great engineering job separating vocals, background sounds and music. That separation is something I think most people will notice immediately. On a normal TV those sounds are all bottle together and it's hideous to be watching a great quality image with horrid sound.I found a few things annoying--like having to have yet another remote sitting not the table in front of me (the remote doesn't control my Sony blu ray player, I was hoping it would). And I still have to play remote roulette when it comes to shutting everything down--otherwise you look up later and realize some of the gear is still turned on. Just annoying though, it has nothing to do with the quality of the bar.The set up, as I said, is fast. In fact, I was surprised at how short the quick set-up guide was but interestingly they do not repeat that set-up stuff in the full manual that is included--so save the quick set-up sheet if you think you'll need it (I'm sure it's on the Sony site).One thing that made me laugh about the remote is that there is a ""football"" button there for a special football broadcast mode that is supposed to provide a few levels of stadium sound. I haven't watched a game with it yet but this Sunday, it's coming, lol. Also, there is a USB  port at the end of the bar for listening to music (or watching photos, though I haven't yet tried) from a flash/thumb drive. I have not tried the bluetooth system yet and don't really plan to since I have another system for music.By the way, the bar's grille cover is not attached when it is shipped, so be careful in unpacking to handle the bar itself carefully. Also, the subwoofer is pretty heavy--have a place nearby to set it down and get a hand under it as soon as you can.Overall I would say this is a pretty expensive system and will probably come down a bit during the holidays. The set up is quick and painless. The sound is stellar and while it does lack the geographic spread that a surround-sound system offers, I can't say I miss it much. In fact, I've been thinking I might actually prefer this bar regardless but I don't have the other system any longer for comparison. The sound separation of the ST9 is pretty amazing. And I surely don't miss a couple hundred feet of wire going under every piece of furniture and up the walls.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EBJS4WJQT39E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U78GFWW#wasThisHelpful","R3EBJS4WJQT39E","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Epson VS340 XGA is a very bright and a very versatile projector for many different kinds of uses and I think is particularly well suited for sales meetings, classroom lectures and any type of small gathering where having a flexible a/v projector is important. Its not designed to be an entertainment projector (and its not marketed for that), but you can easily show virtually anything that you can load into your laptop (Youtube videos, slide shows, etc.) or save to a USB/flash drive type device. You can also connect a digital camera or camcorder directly.I teach photography to small adult groups and its really a very nice (and silent!) projector in that situation. Ive been using a much older and much less bright (and certainly less colorful) projector for a few years and this is a quantum leap forward in a lot of ways.  For one it remains cool and for another its almost silent.The set up of the projector (and I hate learning yet one more device, it seems I spend half my life doing that) is painless and fast. It comes with a printed quick set-up guide and the full manual is on an included cd. Even before you buy the unit though, you can find both the quick set-up guide and the manual as pdf (or HTML) files on the Epson site (just Google the model # and word manual and it will pop up) and I strongly suggest you read through them before you buy so that you can compare certain features (with other Epson models and with other brands). I really prefer reading the manual online like this because Im looking at it on a 30 monitor instead of a small paper page and you can always print out full pages of just the topics you need (I printed out several pages on Mac laptop vs. Windows configurations). The online manuals have live links (yay!) so you can jump from one page to another via their suggestions. And the pdf files print easily. The cool thing about having live links in the manual and having it as a pdf on your desktop is that if you have a question while youre setting up, you can just do a quick search and usually find the answer.Still, I wish it had come with a printed manual to read first just because I like reading manuals in front of the TV and dont want to print out 150+ page manual.Setting up the projector is really just a matter of attaching the power cord and then attaching the media (laptop, USB/flash drive, etc.) and then turning on the machine. The quick set-up guide is very simple, easy to follow and while you should read the manual, you dont have to read it for the initial tests. One other nice feature in the full guide is that there are size/distance configurations to tell you how far you have to be from a screen or wall to get a certain size of projected image AND for various aspect ratios (this might sound like Greek, but its very useful when you want to guesstimate how big a screen you need in a given size room). For example, to get a 50-inch diagonal projection (4:3 ratiopretty common for slides), you have to be 58-79-inches from the wall/screen. Not bad. That means you could watch a slideshow in your living room at 50 inches if youre only six feet from the wall. (Im going to try that soonwith a movie.) Theres a cover slide, too, so you can leave the image on and just close the lens. There are ratios for 16:9 too in case you want to watch a movie.The manual is extremely well written and illustrated and if you've ever hated an obtuse user manual, you'll be praising whoever wrote and designed the graphics for this one--particularly if you're reading it on a big screen or a laptop. I write a lot of tech stuff for a living and writing good clear instructions is a lot tougher than it looks.The projector is very bright and the color is nicely saturated. I tried it both with room lights on and in a darkened room. Obviously the dark room really pops better, but even with two lamps on 10 or so from the screen, it did well.The projector is extremely versatile when it comes to connections/configurations and you can use a laptop, a VGA video source, a camera, or something very simple like a USB/flash driveI used a thumb drive for my first tests. If you have the space to keep this set up, for instance, you can come home from a day of shooting photos with a digital camera or video camera and then just plug it into the projector to review your days take. Cool.There is software built into the projector so that if you have folders of images, for example, you can choose folders and sub-folders and then navigate to specific images and folders. Youre far better off if you create a slideshow in your computer, of course, and then just operate the show from your laptop or whatever. Interestingly, while there is no LAN capability built in, you can buy a LAN adapter for this so that you can operate from a wireless network. If I can afford the adapter, thats something I will absolutely do in the future (even if only to testbut I havent been able to find a price yet.) By the way, according to the manual there was supposed to be a VGA cable in the box, but I did not get one. Not sure why I need it yet, but I want it nonetheless, lol.Also, if you use several projectors and/or configurations, you can SAVE the configurations from the projector to a USB device or directly to a computer via cable (and presumably via the LAN once you set it up). If you run an a/v dept at a school, this is a life saver.One cool (bad pun) thing is that because of the LED lamps, you dont have to let the projector cool before you shut it off. I had it going for like 30 mins the first time and it was virtually cool. Compare that to fan-cool filament bulb projectors where you must leave the fan running until the bulb is cooled or you risk burning it out. (These bulbs are rated to live 10,000 hours, by the waywhich seems like infinity to me, but we'll see if they last that long, lol.)Finally, the projector has a zoom lens and it has is easy to control via a ring slider and also you can adjust for keystoning quite easily. Also, you can operate virtually all controls (even navigate images in a folder) using the remote. If you are a teacher or salesperson, the remote is great.Cons? I wish that it had a carry handle (like the old Kodak and Elmo projectors) built into the front to that it was easier to carry (its not heavy but who wants to drop it?) and I really wish it came with a carry case or had one as an accessory. Im going to have to buy a case and finding one that fits wont be that easy. And Id love a rechargeable version, but not sure thats even possible.Overall, I think this is a really good presentation projector. I wish I had the next brighter model to compare, but for what Im doing this is generations more sophisticated than my old hot bulb projector and a lot quieter and entirely cool. As a movie projector? I haven tried it yet, but will shortly and will update this then. Sorry for the long review, but if youre buying projector youre going to live with it a long time, you may as well know what youre buying. I have not used a lot of projectors (maybe five) but of those that I have used, this is the best so far. Can't wait to try one of those killer home entertainment models one day!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XOCXHEJOC849/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119FYOSI#wasThisHelpful","R2XOCXHEJOC849","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the most fun summer movies of all time. I'm rewatching it now for probably the 20th time and it just never gets old. Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray are so perfect together that it's a wonder that it's their only picture together (or at least I think it is). You know the plot: Bill Murray plays an out-of-control multi-phobic nutso that latches on to his new shrink: Dreyfus. What Dreyfuss' character doesn't realize (at first, though he soon discovers it) is that ""Bob"" is the patient from hell. Much of the movie was filmed at Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire and the setting is just spectacular.I find it hard to believe that there is anyone that hasn't yet seen this class comedy, but if you haven't, try it.

"Update 10/29/15: As we're heading into hard freezes here in New England, the grass is now very well established and I would say germination was overall very good--slightly better in the sunny areas, but not thin anywhere. I probably applied some of the seed a little more sparingly than I should have, but it will oversees in spring. Looks good. Here's the original review:I have to laugh at some of the reviews I read of this (and other) grass seeds because apparently a lot of people believe that if you just buy grass seed and toss it into your yard, you'll get a great lawn. But growing grass (like growing almost any plant) is a lot like painting: the better the preparation and attention to detail, the better your results will be. I have been using this Scotts mix with great results, though I have to admit, I've had good results with several brands of seeds. (Also ironically, I'm not a big lawn fan, but I live in a suburban neighborhood in Connecticut, so I'm stuck with having some lawn.)I have used this Scotts seed mix (a blend of three different types of grasses for both sun and shade: Abbey Kentucky Bluegrass, Divine Perennial Ryegrass, and Red Fescue) in both spring and now fall and it produces quite well. (I actually think fall is better if the temps are warm because the established root systems will begin to grow earlier in spring.) It does produce better in some areas than others, but how could this not be so if it's a mix of different seed varieties? The purpose of buying a mix is that very few yards have a uniform amount of sunlight (or identical soil type) from one end to the other. Most yards have trees, shrubs, houses, outbuildings, etc., that modify and vary the amount of light in different areas of the yard. By planting a mix, you can feel relatively assured that some of the seed will be ideal for at least one particular area. No, the sun-loving seed probably won't do well in deep shade, but that's exactly why there is a shade seed in the mix.Preparing the soil (even for over planting) is so important.  If the soil can't make contact with the soil, there is no way it can germinate to produce a good root system. Prepping is simple: just mow then rake the area you're going to over seed and then spread. With new areas (or recently reclaimed gardens, etc.), it's a good idea to loosen the soil but not too deeply. If you loosen the ground to too great a depth, much of the seed will fall below the depth at which it can germinate: all seeds need a mix of soil, sunlight and water to germinate. Roughing up the top inch is probably the best depth. I recently decided to eliminate several raised vegetable beds (I give up, farmer's markets are cheaper and easier) and so used some of this seed to replant lawn where the beds (they were 4x12' each) had been. I raked the soil (about 8"" higher than the lawn) out and feathered it into a spreading pattern and then stomped it down a bit, then raked it gently and seeded it with a hand spreader. I would say I got a very high germination rate--though it's September now, so we'll see how it handles the winter. Right now I am very pleased with the thickness of the growth.Also, water the seed immediately and then water it ever single day (unless it rains). Grass seed (even coated seeds like this) desperately need water. You can't skip a day and on hot days (particularly in six-hour+ sun areas, you have to water a few times a day. I just leave a sprinkler in one area, then turn it one a few times a day (on hot days). Often people will see grass sprouting and stop watering it and that causes a high percentage of seed to just dry off--particularly if the temps are in the high 70s or in the 80s for days at a time. If I see a thin patch after 10 days or so (the grass will probably start to germinate in 5-7 days), I'll talk around with a hand spreader and give a little more seed. But putting too much seed is not a good idea because grass will ""crowd out"" and die.Finally, if you need more topsoil, buy a few yards and just spread that over your existing lawn and then rake it in a bit. I did that last year with this seed and it worked superbly in an area that is in heavy shade and I couldn't get to grow for years.I honestly can't say if this Scotts seed works better than other brands because you only use one brand at a time and I've been using Scotts for about 10 years now. I over planted with this particular mix about 10 days ago and I would say I see a substantial amount of growth. And last spring's crop is holding on strong.Preparation and watering are everything.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33PZVWHO8KVM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8KLA38#wasThisHelpful","R33PZVWHO8KVM5","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say that I loved every word of this book and I can't wait to read it again. Yes, the first 100 pages or so (which is a lot, granted) are kind of slow slogging setting up the financing for their epic road trip, but as someone who always dreamed of creating such a wild project, I still found it fascinating. Most author would skip over this preemptory material and get right down to the trip, but then you'd be sitting there halfway though the book wondering, ""Where the heck did the guys get the money and the truck to make such a wild journey?""Once Cahill and his partner get underway, it's a riot to read just how unprepared (after a year or  more of preparing!) they were for some aspects of their trip. And when you read the *scary* accounts of crossing the Andes, all of your fantasies of ""Gee, I'd love to go on an adventure like this"" simply vanish--they vanish over a 7,000-foot cliff to certain death (in a snow storm).If you are a devoted nonfiction reader and you can muster the patience to read the backstory of how this trip came to pass, I think you'll really appreciate the time you invested and just how amazing the road trip really was (from Tierra del Fuego to Prudhoe Bay). I have to admit I was a bit disappointed that the end of the journey (the U.S. portion) seemed like it was rushed (in the writing) and I wish they had gone into more detail. But I gather that after a month of almost nonstop driving and very little food or sleep, they were both pretty much hallucinating.Anyway, I love adventure books.

"Oh, am I having fun with this, lol. The only real Mustang I've ever owned was a 1967 (with a 289, but not the High Performance version) yellow with a black vinyl top  'Stang that my poor father bought new as a fun car and had to surrender to me a few years later when I got my license. I guess he knew that was coming. So it's a lot of fun to revisit my Mustang days...I can almost smell the burgers and fries at the local drive in. Oh, and I got the colors I wanted: white with a blue racing stripe.This remote control car is substantially larger than I thought it would be (around a foot long and fairly wide--I guess the 1:14 ratio should have tipped me off) and it feels pretty substantial, too. I was so anxious to try it that I made a special trip to buy batteries (you'll need 4AA and 2AAA batteries), lol. I really thought the cats might like it zooming around the hardwood floors of the living room, but so far they have been sitting in the next room staring with mild interest and a bit of alarm.This thing really zooms along pretty quickly, but cornering a car this big takes some room--it does not turn on a dime as some of my little cars did when I was a kid. And the range is only about 60' (I haven't tested that yet), so on my street that's about one yard's width. That's not bad, but I have seen kids at a local park with cars that are responding at twice that distance. But for the price, I think this car does a very respectable job at responding to commands (via a trigger-type controller, not a joystick--and the trigger takes some getting used to) and, as I said, it's pretty zippy.I have no clue how long the batteries are going to last, but I suppose at my age (see the first paragraph for an estimate of that) I'm not going to be wearing them down or the neighbors will think I've lost it (or the kids down the street will beg me to let them borrow it). Also, the car rides pretty low and though the tires are pretty big, if you hit a stick or grass patch, you may have to do a quick rescue. I'll try it soon on rougher turf and see how it does. The body seems pretty solid, but I'm not a kid, so I'll probably treat it more gently--hard to tell what a 10 year old could do to it.Overall I think for the price this is a pretty neat car.

"I just reread Potshot for the third time and I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed this book. Spenser gets involved in cleaning out an Arizona town of evil doers and he enlists the help of some of his favorite gentlemen thugs: Chollo, Teddy Sapp, Hawk, etc. The story is typical Parker: half completely believable, half somewhat preposterous and that's just what I like.A lot of Parker's characters are somewhat cartoonish, but in this book I think Parker slowed down a bit and he really rose to the occasion. The storyline is more dense, covers a lot of geographic territory (Boston, Georgia, LA, Arizona) which is somewhat unusual for Spenser, and the characters are certainly more developed. And the investigation is more intense, a bit more real and certainly very exciting.I get the feeling that Parker enjoyed writing this book a lot and I really enjoyed reading it (three times!). Each time that I read a book I write down the start/finish date, and make lots of notes about the plot lines, settings, descriptions, etc. (hey, I'm a writer, what can I say) and this book is just filled with my notes--all of them positive. The ending is kind of fun, too.A lot of Spenser books move along through the sheer force of Parker's dialog (no one is better, no one) and his settings and plots are usually pretty bare bones. But this book is a bit different--it's much richer and that makes it a much more fun read. I actually tried to slow down reading this because I was enjoying it so much.A great book to read on a cold winter's night.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IV045FGDA4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425182886#wasThisHelpful","R2IV045FGDA4P","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm new to Lawrence Block, though I love first-person narratives in detective fiction. I'm a big fan of Robert B. Parker, but I was looking for something perhaps a bit more complex (great as Parker was, his plots tend to run a bit toward the cartoonish) and I got my money's worth with this book. He does change the perspective from first to third person (that took some creative courage, lol), but the book starts out giving you such a great firsthand look through the protagonist's eyes that you love the character immediately. Block is, to be sure, a much slower-paced read than someone like Parker, but the plots and characters are a lot more complex and soulful. I've seen other reviewers suggest that perhaps Block was writing at a lesser creative level in this book, but I have nothing to compare it to. I found this book to be very thought provoking and, again, very soulful. I live about an hour from Manhattan so much of the setting is ultra familiar to me. I loved the book. If you like Parker, I think you'd like Block.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14IUTFPGJPA8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060198311#wasThisHelpful","R14IUTFPGJPA8O","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Coleman propane lanterns since I was a teenager and I've loved every one and kept most of them for years and years. As much hassle as real mantels can be, they emit the most pure and brightest light I can imagine. I've bought and owned several battern-powere lantern, but none comes close to propane for sheer illumination. If you're camping alone in a relatively remote area, it's nice to put this lantern on a rock or tree stump and have good vision for quite a distance (easily 50' if you're burning on high power).As someone else mentioned I think there needs to be a better way to attach the base (though sometimes I just stick the propane tank in a pile of gravel or dirt and it's pretty steady) so that you can move the lantern quickly. I also miss the tie-on mantles (though it took me a long time to get good at tying them).I rarely use propane indoors, but with winter coming here to New England, I love having a super bright lantern like this to set out on the front step to make the neighborhood more cheery when the power goes away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QE4FJ08RGZ1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009PUQFU#wasThisHelpful","R2QE4FJ08RGZ1F","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this is an excellent and very useful book and I am, I gather, the ideal audience for it. This is, to be certain, a beginner's book. I've seen a few reviewers criticize it for being that--but how on Earth do you criticize something for being what it is meant to be: a starter's guide. I'm a Mac person (by nature and by experience) and I think that someone (even a very experienced Windows person) would still need a basics book to operate the Apple OS. You aren't born with this knowledge (unless you're under 20 years old, maybe, lol).I have just acquired my second Windows laptop and fortunately it came with a Windows 10 update (my other Windows laptop has 8.1 installed and I use it as little as possible). The 10 version, however, is much closer in style and ease-of-use to a Mac, so seems much more familiar to me. I'm learning to navigate it substantially faster than I learned on 8.0  and 8.1. And you have to admit, Windows laptops are a boatload cheaper than a Mac laptop.This book is perfect for a dinosaur like myself that needs to be walked through each aspect of the OS one task at a time. It begins with a good look at the basic interface, then moves into a chapter on customizing that interface for your own work. Most of the remaining chapters are very task-specific and deal with things like surfing the web (which may seem too basic for some reviewers, but if the editors were to have omitted this, they would complain that essential basics were left out), sending emails, downloading and viewing images and videos, editing documents, etc.My only real complaint about the book (and I have voiced this complaint about other books in and out of the series) is that a lot of the screen captures are just too small to read (if you're in your 20s, wait until you're in your 50s). Things get worse when the background color for the screen is black and the type is white. The answer is simple: either print a much larger book, the size of a big phone book, or add pages and make each important capture larger. I would imagine that owning an e-version of this book solves that because on my tablet or Kindle, I can probably increase the screens to full size. Duh, yes, you can just look at your computer, but you are not always sitting at your computer when you are reading. So not necessarily a deal-breaker issue, but in the publishing of days gone by, this would probably be a 500 page book (it's just over 300) with larger graphics. (Personally I think that if you buy a print version of any book that you get access to the e-version at a substantial discount.)I'm very satisfied with the book and I think the author took the right road by making this ultra-basic. I write how-to books for a living (and full confession, I have written books for Wiley in the past, but no longer work for them) and I firmly believe you should never presume the reader has any existing knowledge when it comes to a basics book. It's better to be too basic, or redundant to a certain degree, than to throw the reader under the bus just to appear to be very hip and knowledgeable. Going ultra-basic but still being comprehensive is a skill that it takes an entire career to master.If you're new to Windows (and particularly Windows 10), I really recommend this book very highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHV45VX2G915G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119057027#wasThisHelpful","RHV45VX2G915G","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very difficult movie for me to review for this simple reason: I think the script has a lot of holes in it, and yet I love the movie. This is the story of a man who has given up hope, and is dragged back to the world of hope and miracles (kicking and screaming) by a series of events all centered around a woman who thinks she sees the image of Christ on one of his exterior walls.Luke Wilson is the star of the movie and a large part of the reason that I like the movie so very much is that he's simply a perfect actor. Having to act within the limits of a script that, as I said, has some serious holes, he manages to pull this whole film together. He emotions, his body language, his facial expressions very powerful. I loved watching him act.I really can't detail the things I think are weak in the script without putting some spoilers in this review and I don't want to do that. It's just that a few things seem to happen with no explanation (and I'm not talking about the miracles that seem to occur pretty regularly in the film) and there is one somewhat crucial scene that is just kind of glossed over quickly.Anyway, I loved the movie. I'm holding back one star because of my personal issues with the script. There is a very fine documentary on the making of the film that was really entertaining and I think all film students should watch it. If you like quirky and offbeat films, and if you know of Luke Wilson and like him, you'll love this movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R208QPI66LAHAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FES0JI#wasThisHelpful","R208QPI66LAHAI","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book to help me to some travel research for a photo trip that I was planning. While that trip got postponed, I ended up spending a lot of time with this book just because I discovered so much that I didn't know about Wisconsin. This book is just packed with information and it's all delivered in an extremely interesting and readable way. In fact, I will go out on a limb and say it's one of the best-written travel guides that I've read in a very long time (and I'm a travel writer by profession).The author, Thomas Huhti, obviously knows and loves Wisconsin and I found myself reading about places I'd never heard of before. I don't know if the author had a staff helping him research the text, but he did a fantastic job of research and organization--and I'm not sure it's a job I'd ever welcome taking on. A *lot* of work went into this book. (And no, I don't know the author, lol.) I loved the small reference to the fur trade helping to build cities, and how fishing seems to be such a large part of the state's recreational history.My only disappointment in the book is that other than a small section up front, all of the photos are in black and white. I would love to see a lot more color photography. There are lots of small maps, too, and they are simple and easy to use--clear maps being a rarity in a lot of travel guides.If I was heading to Wisconsin (and I hope I am soon), I'd be thrilled to have this book along. By the way, I find it almost impossible to believe that the publisher has allowed this book to go out of print--perhaps they are planning an update.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S27XMGQT6EDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1598807455#wasThisHelpful","R3S27XMGQT6EDH","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a small antiques business on the side and these labels are perfect for tagging all sorts of items from lamps to furniture. With the smaller things (a vase, lamp, etc.) I can use the string to tie on the label. And with larger items like furniture, I can simply tape the string to the item. The nice thing about tags of this size is that I can put pricing information, as well as some identifying information. Also, everything in the antiques biz is about the ""story"" behind the item, so having room to jot down a quick history or provenance about a piece is great.The tags are very strong and they take Sharpie ink nicely. Even better, the Sharpie ink doesn't bleed through at all. Cheaper tags do bleed through which means you can only write legibly on one side. With these, I've been writing on both sides and unless you hold them up to a very bright light, you'd never know there was writing on the other side. I wouldn't mind if the string were a few inches longer, it would help get it around lamp bases and things, but it's workable.By the way, these are nice if you're selling books, too, because you can insert the price tag as a bookmark. The grommet is super strong, also. The price seems high at first, but when you consider you're getting 1,000 labels, let's face it, that's only four cents a tag (at $40, the box).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R1XJ24IHYZQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003H8WRC6#wasThisHelpful","R1R1XJ24IHYZQZ","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I have to say about this light (bear with me a minute, I just have to rant a bit)  is that whoever designed the retail packaging (not the shipping packaging, I mean the product packaging) was obviously a bored engineer. Everything these days is over packaged and I find it hugely annoying. I had to cut no less than five pieces of tape, untwine a wire tie and then cut some ribbon at the bottom whose purpose I have yet to figure out. I also found the battery installation to be annoying--you have to find a micro screwdriver and unscrew two screws--and then you have to deal with another ribbon. I gather that the battery compartment screws are there to prevent kids from pulling out the batteries, which is an excellent idea, but it's a bit time consuming.The light itself is fine, it's not terribly bright which I gather is a good thing since it's just a nightlight. You want to comfort kids, not keep them awake staring at the light, lol. One minor criticism is that the entire monkey face is not evenly lit. The mouth area is shadowed a bit by the inner workings of the lamp so it's darker than the rest of the face. I also don't particularly understand the use of black opaque eyes instead of white--which probably would have made the eyes light up a bit. But no big deal, this is a nightlight, not a glowing monkey portrait.The on/off switch is easy to use and big enough so any kid can find and operate it. The handle is nice and solid and molded into the lamp. It seems well built, solid, unlikely to break unless someone tried really hard. And the battery compartment while annoying (to me) is secure and that's the key thing.I would think that if I had had this in my room when I was really small I would have found it comforting and I do like the idea that it shuts itself off after 30 minutes. I think small kids would think this is a fun present.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DIV28SFFZFCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKKT0B2#wasThisHelpful","R2DIV28SFFZFCS","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another great film from John Waters (and from Johnny Depp). I love these early films of Baltimore that showcase early rock 'n roll and soul music--and dancing. Just a great, fun film with a silly but entertaining plot. Waters' great skill is capturing a moment in time and revealing it in all of its strange, funny, romantic and silly perfection (and imperfections). To be sure, Waters looks through rose-colored glasses, but he always errs on the side of humanity and humor and that is what makes him a genius.But someone tell me, what has happened to him?

"I live in New England just a few miles from the coast and only blocks from a river where Captain Kidd is said to have buried treasure (too bad he didn't say where), so reading about pirates has been a hobby since I was a kid. This book is a great account of the pirates of the New England coast, so it's perfectly aimed at me. The writings a tad stodgy at times but it's not a difficult or boring read by any means. In fact, every time I pick it up to read a few pages, I end up reading several times that. You will learn a great deal about the history of pirates, of New England and of sea commerce and there's lots and lots of adventure along the way.I think any New Englander will get a great kick of of this book and I have to say, for the price I paid used, it was a great find (and even new these Dover books are quite a bargain--and the quality of the printing is just fine).

"This is the one of two Sony Blu-Ray players that I own. The other is a 2013 model S5100 that, for some reason, now costs more than twice what I paid for it. This newer edition (2015) is a significantly better unit in some ways and costs half the price of the older version. Go figure. The good thing is that, as I played with this new model, I had a point of reference in the same brand and model line, which is rare but nice.First let me say that set up of this player is completely simple. All that you really have to do is plug in an HDMI cable and the power unit and you're done (at least with the hard connections). Funny, when I set up the older unit, more than a year ago, I was a bit afraid of connecting it up to my router. I guess I just didn't have much confidence such magic really worked. OK, a computer yes, but a Blu Ray player? I was wrong with that one as with this one, making the signature to my router was simple. Also now, as then, I used making my connection to Amazon (Prime Video) as my test case and aside from having to tap in a password, it's a breeze. In fact, for someone with as little confidence as he has in all things wireless, it was a piece of cake. I was watching an old episode of Cheers in minutes.Even though I have a comparison unit (they are in different room, naturally), I can't honestly say if the wifi is any faster and that is partly because this new S5500 unit is in my den, at the farthest point from my router. Any speed delays I'm seeing are probably entirely due to that. But in all fairness, they seem almost identical to me in speed. I'm planning to add a signal booster soon (recommendations welcome) and when I do, I'll probably have a better appraisal for a speed comparison.This unit has 300 streaming apps as compared to 100 with the older unit and you'll be old before you go through them all. Some apps really suck, but that's the fault of the provider of that app, not Sony. Youtube is painfully slow on both units and that's something I don't understand. When I get the signal booster I will try again and if this new unit is faster (significantly) I will update this review. Oh, how I'd like to watch more Van Morrison concerts on Youtube!OK, so that's wifi connection. As far as blu ray quality goes: superb. The first movie I watched on this was ""Get Low"" with Bill Murray and Robert Duval and I'm so happy that I own it on blu ray. But I also watched ""Something About Mary"" on dvd and yes, there is a marked quality improvement over watching it on a straight dvd player. No question, the dvd quality is enhanced.I have not tried a mirroring configuration yet, but I hope to do it soon. That's a little beyond my lame skill sets, but I'll try.Also, I am only listening now through the very moderate-quality speakers in my 42"" Vizio so I can't really comment on audio quality. But I'm going to add a speaker system or sound bar to this soon and I am hoping that the sound is good. I have a Create speaker system hooked up to the other TV and it's massively better than the built-in speakers (and for like $40).For under $100 I think this is a bargain and, honestly, I would spend too much time wondering. For that kind of money, this is a steal. I'll update this review in a few weeks when I've played with various features more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G29KWYMNFFU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYFCJOM#wasThisHelpful","R3G29KWYMNFFU8","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though my ""outdoor"" furniture is in a screened-in porch, it is still prone to getting rained on when there is significant wind. Up until now, an approaching storm meant that I had to push the furniture away from the screened perimeter of the porch and, in a really bad storm, bring the cushions into the house. The couch and chairs are weatherproof, but still no point in getting the cushions wet if I don't have to. Up until now I've been using cheap plastic painting tarps (1 mil) from the hardware store--they do the job, but they won't last long and they are none too pretty to look at.This Soto cover has really solved that problem in a big way because now, if a storm is approaching, I can just cover the couch and not worry about it. The cover is just barely big enough for my couch (it's a bit on the large side), but it does cover it. And while I don't really need them the tie-down straps are plenty long enough and if the furniture were out on the patio, would be great to use. The fabric, while thin enough to be lightweight (I can cover the couch by myself in just a few minutes) appears to be very strong and it has already been tested in a downpour on a windy day so I know it's rainproof. Getting the cover back in the case is one of those things I'm not particularly  patient with but it wasn't a problem, as you fold and push the air out, it collapses again nicely. Also, I can just slip the case and cover right under the couch, so I don't have to go hunting for it.I can't say if the vent holes do or don't allow rain in because again, the furniture is indoors, so partly protected already.I really think these Soto covers are a good solution and for the price, a bargain. I'm not sure how they would handle winter outdoors, but I really don't think they were designed for a New England winter. I'm planning on getting a pair of chair covers soon. I hope I don't have to use it, but the warranty seems good, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PKXPXK1ZLATZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRMBRJI#wasThisHelpful","R3PKXPXK1ZLATZ","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun toy and cats, all cats, love to chase stuff like this. Unfortunately, it is also extremely dangerous if you are not watching the cats every second.

A fun toy if you are supervising constantly, but otherwise, I don't trust it (or rather, the cats).","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NQZ5ZLW9YVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002DHV16#wasThisHelpful","R2NQZ5ZLW9YVC","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good basic case that does a good job of protecting the tablet. I have better cases for various tablets (a great OtterBox case for my iPad), but for a simple protective case at well under $10, this works fine. If you're really on the go a lot or have kids that tend to shove stuff in backpacks and then use the backpack for a pillow, you might want to look at a more rugged case, or if you want advanced features like magnets that sleep/wake your tablets. But again, for a good accessible cover at a ridiculously cheap price (especially with Prime shipping), a good deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R353FHU510O85N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S9J5MPC#wasThisHelpful","R353FHU510O85N","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am the right age that I grew up with the Andy Griffith show and after all these years, I still believe it was the finest television show ever produced. I've probably watched some of the episodes hundreds of times, easily, and they never get old.

"This toy really brings out the kid in me and if I had seen this when I was small, my parents would have been under merciless assault until they bought it for me. As it was, for every birthday they had to buy me a new Havahart trap so that I could catch and release animals, which I did almost every day in summer. I knew every opossum in the neighborhood on a first-name basis.I'm going to give this toy four stars because I think it's an incredibly clever idea and it does do everything it says it will--the vacuum works (though it's not very strong), the light lights up (it's greenish and kind of cool looking after dark) and it seems pretty well made. If the vacuum were stronger, I would absolutely give it 5+ stars. I first tested the gun with the little foam butterfly that comes with it and it picks that up just fine (you have to make sure the magnifying lens is turned sideways or it blocks the vacuum draw). Then I tested it on bits of cat fur (easy to hunt down in this house) it works pretty well with those. I tried to catch a housefly but he was a tad faster than me and every time I put the gun near him he demonstrated why compound eyes are such good protection--impossible to fool him.I can't wait to find an insect that is slow enough for me to suck up. I think the size of the bugs you can catch will be limited to about the size of a dime, otherwise they won't get past the magnifying lens (at least not willingly). But I think for small moths and perhaps fireflies, it might work just fine (of course, when I was a kid a mason jar worked just as well!).The gun is pretty nicely made, but let's face it, this is intended for kids and they can destroy anything. One thing that I like is that the batteries (4AA, kind of expensive to refill) are in a compartment in the handle that requires a screwdriver to open--which means the batteries won't be falling out in the backyard. That was a good design decision.Fun toy! I wish I had it when I was 8, I would have been up nights chasing bugs. I wish the vacuum was stronger but otherwise, a nice toy or gift. I'll have to get the bug cage next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W09ST9CHL0ZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJGU9GK#wasThisHelpful","R3W09ST9CHL0ZI","A1O97WKID9L3IA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O97WKID9L3IA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I choose the hot pink color and I absolutely love the color and the fit of this waist trainer. Its made really nice and strong and similar waist trainers cost a whole lot more than this one does. It takes a few minutes to take on and off with all the hook and eye clasps but once you get the hang of it, it goes pretty quick. I wear mine under my clothes like tops and dresses and it doesn't show and makes my clothes look and fit way better. It makes my bust look and feel larger and my waist look smaller and flat.

I was amazed by how comfortable this shaper is and the latex doesn't make me hot or feel uncomfortable. It does take a few minutes to take on and off but it is well worth it by how great it makes me look when its on. The clasps are like the hook and eyes on a bra and its adjustable so you can decide how tight you want to wear it. The leopard print is really pretty and I wear mine outside of my clothes. I wear a plain black tank top and the shaper over it and it looks great together. The shaper really gives me the flat stomach and hourglass shape that I love.

Its comfortable to wear for hours at a time and the red and black goes great with the rest of my costume. Not only does it make my waist look smaller but it also makes my bust look larger.

"This shaper is way nicer in person than in the photos. The floral design is really detailed and beautiful and has a satin like feel to it. The shaper has a lace up back so its quite forgiving if you're in between sizes like I am. There's also a modesty panel where the lace up part is so you don't show too much skin. The hook and eye closure in the front is also made strong and sturdy so it won't tear or rip when you are tightening it. The shaper is made really nice and has a beautiful design and I've priced similar shapers and they were 3 or 4 times more. This shaper is pretty comfortable to wear for hours at a time. I've worn other shapers and the boning would always dig into my skin and be uncomfortable but this shaper doesn't do that. It also does a great job of sucking in and hiding my stomach and giving me a nice flat stomach and hourglass figure.

"I ordered the black and red for my fiancee since these are his favorite colors and he loves these glasses. They are really lightweight and comfortable to wear all day long. The frames are really well made and when you open and close the glasses the arms aren't loose or wobble at all. The lens are dark and do a great job he says of blocking out the brightness of the sun in the afternoons on his way to work. I've tried them on too and they make everything look really clear and bright and make great driving glasses. These glasses come with a zippered hard case with clip so you can clip the case to a backpack, your belt loops, or anything else you choose. It also comes with a cloth bag to store the sunglasses in, a cleaning cloth, and a cord to wear the glasses around your neck if you like. The glasses are nice and lightweight and made really durable so if you drop them they won't crack or break the frames. The sunglasses have a nice sporty design too and fit my fiancee's face and look great on him. They stay put on his head too even when he's wearing them while riding his motorcycle.

"This is a tale about a young boy who isnt like the rest. He cant seem to find joy, emotional connection, or excitement in any of the pursuits that occupy his peers. That all changes once he attends his first funeral and finds an insatiable lust for the dead.This story isnt called The Loved Dead for nothing!I listened to this story as an audiobook production complete with spooky sound effects that added to the already creepy atmosphere. The narrator spoke in a sinister tone but at times got a little whispery and was sometimes drowned out by the sound effects. He also stumbled a little here and there over the words. I caught it which is rare but good because it means the story hooked me. Id advise listening to this version with headphones and not in your car.After some confusion about the co-authoring credits on the title, I did my usual 30 seconds of internet research and learned that this story was written by C.M. Eddy and revised by H.P. Lovecraft. It was written in 1919 and I imagine it was quite scandalous back then. But, now? Well I can only speak for myself, but I fear I am too jaded to get too bothered by the vaguely disturbing writings of a serial killing perv who enjoys purple prose. It had some creepy moments, to be sure, and I am certainly glad I am finished spending time in this guys head.If youre looking for something to get under your skin for 48 minutes this story might be meant for you.*I received a free copy of this audio from the publisher/author/narrator in exchange for an honest review and that's what you're getting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39VM2PJB7T2V4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QN6VZ8#wasThisHelpful","R39VM2PJB7T2V4","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am feeling so incredibly unmotivated and since there are already a zillion reviews of this book here, there and everywhere, I shall be brief. Is there really a need for a zillion plot synopsis-ez, anyway? My lazy side says no, no, theres definitely no need today.I didnt like the characters but I still liked the book. I dont know why. I just did. I didn't like it quite as much as Gone Girl but it still kept me hooked. Please dont ask me to explain. As I mentioned, Im too lazy for all that today.Libby, Ben, Melissa, Deandra, Runner and whoever else Ive already forgotten? Yeah, theyre all jerks in their own little ways and are mostly horribly unlikable people, with all sorts of human failings. Only mom was sympathetic. That poor woman had terrible taste in men and a bad luck cloud hanging over her head but she did as best as she could to provide for her kidlets.Libby is the main character and shes a depressed, selfish, miserable mess of a woman who cant seem to function in society if society is not paying her way. Ugh, spare me your boo-hoo-ery and get thee a job. I have no sympathy for this type of person but you dont care about that. Anyhow, this is the story of unlikable Libby. When Libby was seven, her mother and two sisters were murdered. And yes, that is horrible but shes now 31 and still trying to live off sympathy. Because Libby has run out of cash, she decides to accept an offer from a group of creepers called The Kill Club who live and breathe for secretive true crime conventions. They pay her to start digging into the events that destroyed her childhood. This finally gives her some oomph and she uncovers all kinds of ugly tidbits and secrets. Oops, I guess I cannot get through a review without rehashing some of the plot.It was this darkness simmering just under the surface that I loved so very much about the story. It kept me guessing and it kept me reading and I couldnt get enough of the deep, dark, awful secrets. Perhaps I am just as bad as those kill club freaks.The story jumps back and forth between the present day and the days leading up to the massacre and is written in such a way that it hooked me instead of frustrating me. I listened to this on audio which I highly recommend if audio is your thing. There were several narrators and they all did the writing justice, adding emotion and nuance to the written word.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V90YSOQBBN38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028TY1CO#wasThisHelpful","R3V90YSOQBBN38","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A picture is worth all the words, right? Ok, so here's what the medium top looks like on a 5'2, 115 lb person with a very small chest. It fits me snug but it's not scandalously snug, it's just about right for weekend wear. I normally wear a small in most brands so you might want to size up unless you like shirts that fit you like a second skin. As you can see in the closeup picture, the mesh is a wee bit see-through but it's mesh, mesh is see through! I simply wear a black bra, sports bra or bralette and it looks nice and respectable. The rest of it is not see through, at least in the black shade. The material is nice and stretchy and doesn't ride up and show your belly but if you have any lumps and bumps they will probably show. It does not fit loosely like the girl in promo pictures blouse (unless you're 95 lbs or so)! It looks nice with skinny jeans and could be dressed up with some heels and a cute skirt but I'm not that fancy. All in all a great shirt that I'll wear often.*I received this item from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review and that's what you're getting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZMUIFW9OZ0O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FUDZGM#wasThisHelpful","R1ZMUIFW9OZ0O7","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading a few reviews here, I was a little leery about this. I had fears of it bending and breaking and being a cheapo piece of junk. I've purchased many a clothing rack only to have them break under the weight of only a few skimpy dance outfits so honestly wasn't expecting too much. A BIG thank you goes to the reviewer who figured out how to put this together so it was more stable. I followed those instructions (both the screws facing forward) and have had absolutely no tippage. It was a smidge taller than I anticipated but that's my fault for not reading the specs, it was a breeze to put together, required no tools and works great for holding all of my wet laundry that can't go in the dryer, As long as you evenly balance out the weight on both sides, I don't see how you could tip it. My husband recently put a heavy winter coat on one side with nothing on the other and it didn't budge. I think it's a great buy for the money. I've been using it for several weeks and nothing has popped off or bent. If that changes in the future, I'll be sure to let you know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NSFJEZFEUSK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AX0QCS#wasThisHelpful","R3NSFJEZFEUSK2","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Percival Whyborne is a shy, socially awkward kind of guy, comfortable hiding away with moldy old tomes. The thought of taking a lunch outside his office and having to actually converse with someone is out of his comfort zone. He can speak 13 languages and can read even more but he doesnt think that any big thing.Hes sweet and modest and hiding himself from the world for more reasons than shyness.When Griffin Flaherty, a handsome PI walks into his life and ask Whyborne to decipher a mysterious journal his world is about to get a whole heck of a lot more exciting. As you may have guessed, this is no ordinary old book.Some very sinister things happen and Whyborne finds himself playing a huge role in all of it. Hes also forced to put some demons in his past to rest which resulted in some pretty great character building. Along the way, he and Griffin become friends and in between mystery solving and monster slaying theres plenty of time for innocent kisses and a whole lot more.Widdershins is a strange mix of monsters, mystery, and action along with a well-developed sweet and very sexy romance. I was worried it would fall down and fail me but somehow it all works. There is great care taken here to develop all aspects of the story. It has spooky atmosphere and lovable characters. There was only one point where I had my doubts, when Whyborne discovers something in Griffins room, but I got over it and cannot wait to read more.""This audiobook was provided by the author, narrator, or publisher at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review courtesy of AudiobookBlast.com.""I listen to a ton of audio and I am pretty picky about narration. This narrator did a decent job with Whyborne but unfortunately a not-so-great job with Griffins character. They have very different personalities but sound exactly alike which left me feeling a little confused here and there (though I admit that is not too difficult a feat). I wouldve liked more of a distinction between the two and would give the narration a 3 while the story gets a 4 1/2. Even with that said, I've just restarted the audio because I can't face deleting it without listening one more time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q49564VTTKG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D1YQ3TO#wasThisHelpful","R1Q49564VTTKG2","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know a secret. If you have too much stuff and its bugging you then get rid of it. All of it. Well, nearly all of it. Save a few things but only the things you absolutely love, the things that spark joy within your being (youll know it when you feel it, says the author) and dont bring more things into the house unless you love and/or need them. Dont think you can do that? Well, never mind then.This author wants you to be absolutely ruthless with your possessions and do it in one fell swoop. Dont dilly-dally and put certain unpleasant things off. Absolutely do not waste money buying storage solutions. Just get rid of your stuff and you wont have to store it or dust it or leave it there to feel bad for itself. Now, none of this is a bad thing (though the last might be a wee bit kooky) and honestly Im all for it. I had way too much crap lying about and it was driving me crazy. Broken crap, ugly crap, gifted crap, crap that had been there so long it was invisible to me. But this book has a problem and it is a BIG one that Im betting many of you here on this site may take issue with as well.Step #2, you see, is books. BOOKS! Step freaking two is BOOKS. As you can probably easily imagine, I am stuck here on step #2 because, well, its a call to action to rid myself of my precious books! Ive been collecting books since I was twelve years old. I have a lot of books but Im afraid I may love them all.#1 was clothes, shoes, accessories and that was a breeze. Who needs clothes taking up space that could hold a few books? This was easy, thought I. My closet was done in an hour or so. Everything culled, sorted and color coded and folded all nice and tidy-like. I could blow through this, thought I. A zen and clutter-free life was within my grasp. I had this. Then step #2 happened and I was instructed to rid myself of all of the books I have loved before (but may not love again) and all of the books I have not read yet. Uh oh. I was told to remove my TBR pile(s) from my life. Forever. And almost always. Shell allow you to re-buy digitally if you are pining away and dying of sadness for it. I was instructed to touch each one and see if it sparked that apparently not-so-elusive feeling of joy within me. Trouble is they all kind of did. I suppose I am broken. I tried folks, I truly did. I took pictures and even posted them online in an attempt to humiliate myself into following through. I even went so far as removing a gigantor bookshelf, stocked three piles deep, floor-to-ceiling, from my room as well as an armoire I no longer needed. I have to admit my room looks and feels calms and free and spacious. The bookshelf now neatly resides in my basement. I pulled off all of the books and starting sorting them but it made me incredibly sad to think about tossing them out of my house where they might potentially end up in a trash/recycle bin (according to the author everything has feelings so how could I allow this? Better they be a little lonesome on my shelf than DEAD, right?!). Instead of tossing them into bags, I started arranging them by color (which she wants you to do with clothes) and then I put all but a dozen or so back up on the shelves. They look happy and pretty and they brighten the back wall of the basement. I have decided that I am keeping them. They are my one and only vice and I work hard. They are not clutter.I think I shall pretend that step 2 was nothing but a fever dream.After I was revived with sniffing salts I got back to business. So next comes all of the other stuff which I can easily part ways with; the paper, the stuff no one ever eats, the gadgets (my days of bread baking are over), the broken things that weve been thinking well fix someday, the mementos, pictures and all the other useless crapola that has been residing in the basement since we moved in a million years ago. Ive removed countless bags of trash and several car loads of stuff and hauled them to Goodwill and I miss none of it. It is so much easier to clean my house now. I havent followed this plan as written, its difficult when you live with several other people, so we still have some bins and crud to get to but now I'm inspired to keep at it.This book will give you some unique tools and I do recommend it if you skip step two or perhaps save it for last, if youre anything like me. She has a nifty way of folding clothes that helped me fit everything into a few drawers and will keep me in check if I decide I need more yoga pants. You really do see just how much of each clothing category you own when you pile them all on the bed/floor and separate them into their own little categories. She doesnt declutter by room but by category. This stops you from getting stuck (on pictures or mementos which are left for the end) and forces you to deal with an entire category and actually finish the job so you never have to do it again. She also tells you to start with a clear vision of your end result. That bit of advice has helped me tremendously.The author clearly has an obsession with tidying. She does not deny this. Apparently, shes been this way since she was a wee, strange child and goes into great detail at the beginning of book about her childhood hobby of tidying. This makes the start a bit of a slog. I found some of her beliefs a little quirky and I will not be emptying my bag out each night so my stuff can breathe only to put everything back in come morning (what the?!) but if you can overlook some of the odd things she says, youll more than likely find something here to help you out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ0JH1QW6Q6HF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607747308#wasThisHelpful","RZ0JH1QW6Q6HF","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3 1/2 Stars  Beautiful Creatures is a young adult fantasy novel about a sweet boy named Ethan who wants nothing more than to graduate high school and leave his small town life far behind.But then a new girl named Lena moves to town and life gets much more interesting for Ethan.They are drawn together despite their differences. Lena lives with her uncle who is the creepiest man in town and she drives his hearse. She is an immediate outcast despite her beauty. Her family is full of secrets. Ethan loves to read but is also very much a jock and does what he must to fit in. He cannot resist Lena and she cannot resist him. They can read each others thoughts and soon they are in deeply in love and enmeshed in a battle to save Lena from turning dark on her 16th birthday.So theres the gist. Its not bad and its not horrible but it sure is far too long. At least 100 pages too long. I mostly enjoyed it but I have to admit that I absolutely did not find the psychic link between them romantic in any way. But Im not 16 either. Honestly, though, would you want a love interest in your head, privy to your every thought? What if he wears some doofy hat to school and you dont know how to tell him? Guess you just did! What if hes a bad kisser and you couldnt shield your thoughts in time? Maybe Im just an awful person but I think Id spend most of my day wanting a sink hole to swallow me.So, if you have many hours to spare while youre doing dishes, supposed to be working or stuck in the car and you want to read about a boy who may or may not be too good to be true (Ethan takes his three aging aunties to church EVERY Saturday - he is such a good boy) you may want to check this out in audio. The production, eerie music and the narration are fabulous, even if the story may not have been.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R378GD3779YTFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XWUPK8#wasThisHelpful","R378GD3779YTFE","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine this, if you will, you dont feel so hot and step into the rest room to take care of business. While you were away, the earth has been plagued by demonic hounds. You probably shouldn't have eaten so many hot wings but it looks like they may have saved your life this time around! So as these hounds are busy eating faces and humping legs (and other things) with their giant doggie parts, you are left stumbling about trying to figure out exactly what the hell happened. Fortunately you soon find a few other misfits and are off on a mission to find a statue and save the world!This book is most definitely bizarro. I usually have trouble finishing bizarro books because theyre too far out there for me but this one stayed grounded with some fun humor that kept me reading. It was bat s*** crazy, kind of gross in parts and a little too heavy on the non-stop action side for my personal taste. There are hounds from another dimension, warty dwarves, a monkey in a wedding dress, mer-people, a man-sized tribble costume and a whole lot more packed in here. Theres no way I can explain the plot and Im not even going to try. Ill just say that its a very bad idea to wear a tribble costume around a bunch of hung hounds and leave it at that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFDP7AULP22XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R20ARG8#wasThisHelpful","RFDP7AULP22XP","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I listened to this book as an unabridged audiobook read by Rosalyn Landor. She does a fine rather snooty job with the narration which fits the historical setting and a fabulous job with the heroine but when it comes time to do to the manly voices I cringed a little. I wouldve much rather had a male voicing the guy parts but they didnt ask me.Its been a bit since Ive read a historical romance and this one had a lovely leisurely setup that introduced the relationship between childhood friends Michael and Penelope by letters they wrote when they were children and via flashbacks to their friendship. It gave me high hopes for the relationship to come.As a young man, Michael lost everything in a moment of overeager stupidity and has spent the past decade working to reclaim what was once his. He disappeared from Penelopes life and hasnt been there when shes needed a friend. Because her daddy wants her married off, and soon, hes attached some very attractive land to Penelopes dowry. Land that once belonged to Michael, land Michael will do almost anything to get back . . .Can you see where this is going?So yeah, Michael suddenly re-enters her life and pretty much steamrolls over it to get what he wants. He doesnt seem anything like the Michael from the letters and that made me a little sad for Penelope who was so genuinely happy to see her old friend when they meet up again. But then he opens his mouth and ugly spew slips out and shes not so thrilled. Hes changed and hes a demanding ass who keeps secrets and strong-arms her into marrying him and then is all about The Revenge. He must get The Revenge! Even if it hurts those who love him.Ugh. Ugh. And ugh. I dont like this type of hero. Never will, Im sad to say. He does eventually realize the error of his ways but its all a little too little, a little too late. I am not a patient gal so I can only give this one a three. The writing was great; there was wit, sensuality and Penelope was not a push over and I will read this author in the future but I cant give this story any more than a 3 because of Michael. He is a jerk, he knows hes a jerk at least, but that does not change the fact that he behaves like a jerk for a majority of the story. His character flaw causes no end of conflict and though his fingers may have been magical, his nonsense had me wanting to strangle him a little.Im going to turn you from light to dark, from good to bad. Im going to ruin you. She didnt care. She was his. He owned her in this moment, with this touch. And do you know how it will feel? She sighed the word this time. Splendid.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23J027TG155IL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EJRXKK#wasThisHelpful","R23J027TG155IL","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hmmm, I don't know if I received a different curtain from all of these 5 star reviewers here but I am not happy at all with the one I received. I can't help but wonder if they had used it less than a week before writing their reviews? It is super thin, super flimsy, has a magnet on the two bottom corners but they do next to nothing and it flops all around when the shower is running. It is also NOT mildew free which is the main reason I purchased it. I have had this in the shower for only a few weeks and the bottom 2 inches look as if it's been sitting there for a decade and I clean my shower nearly every day.

"Hmmm, how to rate that this one? I'll start with a 3 and see what I end up with once I spew out my thoughts.Bare-Knuckle love is a little too weird to be believable. Jason is out of cash, unemployed and agrees to lose a bare-knuckle underground cage fight. During the fight he spots an old high school crush in the crowd and his pride forces him to throw common sense out the window and he wins the fight.This isnt the weird part.The weirdness begins when it disclosed that the crush is the leader of a big, bad motorcycle club. Hes straight (or pretends to be) but then forces Jason to get on his knees and do a very naughty thing because hes so damn mad that Jason didnt throw the fight. Jason does what hes commanded because Jason has no self-worth. Hyde has filmed the whole thing and uses it against Jason. This is sad and a little strange but Im easy and went with it.But then, oh but then . . . Hyde (good name for him, really, kudos to the author) decides to take Jason home and it is here that the WTFery begins. Hyde, you see, is married to a lesbian whose lover lives in the same house all cozy-like. Hyde and his wife have a little boy. Hyde is allowed to have lovers but not make sexy noise within hearing range of the boy. Hyde lives a very normal life at home that is almost sweet. Into this little bubble of non-reality he brings an illegal MMA fighter without a second thought?! What on earth?Sooooo, tell me if this scenario makes any kind of sense or if Im just having a really bad comprehension moment.Hyde is basically holding Jason prisoner to his sexual whim (though Jason doesnt seem to mind the sex part) and hes also forcing him to throw another fight because he has that humiliating little sex vid of him. Jason does whatever Hyde demands because hes terrified of the video getting out and because he has no self-confidence. His inner monologue sounds like a beaten and bullied teen and it made me so sad.Jason, however, knows that this big bad MC leader is keeping a secret life that would destroy his standing in the MC and would destroy his life if word got out.Hmmm, Id say Jason WINS this smack-down by a landslide. Sadly Jason is not bright enough to realize this. Or hes too blinded by the sex and cant think straight.Anyhow, this is the premise which, if you ask me, is all kinds of terrible. Still, I read it to the very end and have to admit that it was kind of sexy in a completely awful way.2 ? 3? Im still on the fence. The writing wasnt horrible and I'd read this author again because despite my dislike of most of the story, it managed to draw me in. I very much disliked Hyde and felt that the Jason was too weak a character. He needed a hug and a nice guy. Instead he got stuck with Hyde. Ah well. Insta-lust will do that to you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14H8F0X1RWNHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01018NMMI#wasThisHelpful","R14H8F0X1RWNHM","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first half or so of this book is heart-crushing. It may break your heart, even if you think you dont have one.Dan trains horses and he is one of the best. His life was bliss until a riding accident destroyed his world a year ago. Now his lover is in a coma and has been declared brain dead. Dan cant let go and wants to keep Justin around just to be near him. When he is forced to let Justin go (due to circumstances out of his control), he has to reluctantly rebuild his life. Oh my heart. This part is so painful.The rest of the novel is all about Dan attempting to start over with the horses he and Justin loved and forcing himself to slowly step into building new relationship.Its painful and its messy. Dont pick this book up thinking youre too hard-shelled to cry. You will. It may destroy you for a while. I had to take a few breaks from all of the sadness. But dont worry its not all grief and tears. Dan eventually begins to move on and meets a nice guy hes attracted to as well as a couple who are both attracted to him. Its a situation that Dan is certain he is not ready to enter but Evan and Jeff are gorgeous and Evan is very persistent. Jeff is older and he befriends and supports Dan as a friend when he needs it most.Im too old to think a broken heart is romantic. Awww, Jeff, he always knows just what to say.This book doesnt follow your typical m/m romance formula where two guys meet, fall in love/lust, have a few (usually silly) fights and live happily ever after. I never quite knew how things were going to end and if Dan would ever be able to open his heart to someone new. I liked the not knowing.The pace is rather leisurely and there is a lot of time spent on the day to day ins and outs of horse training. I loved all of it but you might not. It is character driven and I prefer those types of stories, when theyre written well, over an action driven plot/convoluted plot any day. The only action going on here is action of the sexy kind and it comes late into the book so hang in there if you think it wont ever happen.

"From the author who brought you Creamed by Cave Creatures (which I very much enjoyed).I don't know what this is but it certainly isn't erotica and it certainly is  not what I'd consider a five star read by any stretch of the imagination. There's stilted dialogue, stilted narration, beheading, town razing, more murder and rape. None of this is what I'd call erotic but, hey, whatever works for ya. Maybe it's just me. Terrible, ugly, non-erotic things occur and then it JUST ENDS! This isn't even a fully fleshed out short story. It's just a lead in to part 2. And from this snippet I want absolutely nothing to do with Part 2. Call me a wuss if you will. I can take it.I realize this was a freebie and who am I to complain, right? But my time is precious and worth something to me and reading an unfinished story makes me a little crazy. To top it off the rest of the story would cost me $$ for only 99 pages. I DON'T THINK SO.Serves me right. I'm sticking with monster erotica freebies from here on out. At least they have a reason for behaving like monsters!","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K1C81FN8NHUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WKUZHTW#wasThisHelpful","R2K1C81FN8NHUH","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book gets points for its descriptions of an icy cold hell but, most to my dismay because I was truly looking forward to it, it never moved above a 3 star read for me. Ill try to tell you why.As you can guess from the title, a blizzard strikes. But this is no run of the mill blizzard. This blizzard brings with it things that destroy families for years to come.Now this is where my problems begin and end. The setup was pretty great, I was getting into the story and enjoying getting to know the many characters who were introduced and poof!, just like that, the story flash forwards twelve years and I have to play to catch up to remember who lost who, who was involved with who, who was a bit of a jerk. And many of them have moved on, as you will, and have hooked up with others. You get the drift. It was bothersome for someone who has such a lousy memory but wait because it gets worse. The people who went missing or died begin to inhabit the bodies of living people and then my confusion is upped to a whole new level. Oh my poor tired brain.It may be my fault for listening to this as an audiobook. I dont know. People seem to love this book but for me I felt like I was playing a frustrating game of Who was that again? throughout most of the novel and I lost interest in the story and the characters as a result.In the end, it reminded me most of a middle of the road Dean Koontz novel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FTEQSIIERL8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480564907#wasThisHelpful","R1FTEQSIIERL8U","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the second Sky Stars and Moon fire pit I've purchased because it looks so beautiful at night. It does what it should, is easy to assemble and the first one lasted about 5  years before the legs completely corroded and broke off. I'm only giving it four stars because the black paint rusts very quickly. I've had it about a month, used it only 2x's and left it outside. It rained, as it does, and now 1/4 of it is covered in rust.

"Juliet and Colton were once madly in love but Colton ruined it all when he decided to diddle the dog sitter (better than the dog, I suppose!). Juliet is fuming mad and who can blame her? When the story begins this is all fresh and told from Juliets POV. Her emotions are red hot as they are driving together to drop her off at her mothers and you really get her. Her husband is a selfish dolt. Bad luck befalls them as their car is sideswiped and Juliet awakens dazed to find herself shackled to a post and things only get worse from there.  Damn, and I thought my luck was bad!The best thing about Juliet is that she is not a whiner. She acts.The narrator is pure perfection for this tale. She conveys Juliets emotions extremely well as they range from simmering rage to pain, fear and full out anger. Id recommend reading it this way, if youre a fan of audio.I was gifted a copy of this audio from the author with no expectation of a review but I review everything I read and, if you know me at all, you know this in no way changes my thoughts on the book. If it sucked, I would tell you.

"Im going to keep this short and as sweet as I can because everyone seems to adore this story and, sadly, I really didnt.  Before you beat me over the head with the fact that I am a moron who is too ignorant to follow a time-travel story, I have to say that I enjoyed both Stephen Kings 11/23/63 and The Time Travelers Wife so it wasnt the time-travel bits that put me off.  Those books worked for me because of the characters. Though this story has very strong characters and it was interesting to see how much Em changes as she matures, something about them just didnt grab me enough to become emotionally invested in their story.  Im sure its a case of its me, not you and Ill leave it at that.Were I you and considering this audio I would recommend opting for the paperback instead.  Something about the narrators tone, almost bordering on monotonous here and there, made it very difficult to get through and two of the characters, friends of Marinas whose names escape me, were cringe inducing. One sounded like an insipid moron and the other sounded like some snooty old socialite with some sort of strange accent and I believe she was only 16 or so. The rest of the voices were decent but those two? Those two were truly awful. It's a good thing they only played bit parts or this would've been a DNF because the voices bothered me so much.With that said, well, there's not much more to say. Everyone else loves it but I just thought it was okay.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14IJVKBGED4DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452668965#wasThisHelpful","R14IJVKBGED4DG","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Somehow I ended up with an abridged copy of this audiobook. I don't like abridged because I always feel like I'm missing something super important, usually characterization, but this abridgement wasnt too bad.This story is about a psycho attempting to create a family by abducting women through open houses.  It has tones of that horrible triple abduction story in Cleveland, where the monster kept three women imprisoned for his own selfish needs for over a decade. Truly a horrible, nightmarish true-crime. But this book was written years before Castro was exposed as a rapist and kidnapper which makes reading this all the more horrifying. This version doesnt linger too much on the damage inflicted on the victims and for that I am grateful. I had enough of that after watching Lifetimes Cleveland Abduction.  I cant speak for the unabridged version, however, so beware.When teen Lindsay is abducted, her mother Kara, distraught and heartbroken, takes action. When things go from bad to even worse for Kara she doesnt dissolve into a puddle of self-pity but keeps on keeping on with the search. As admirable as that is, it felt a little unbelievable and unnatural but Ill chalk it up to the four hours that were cut from this version and give it a pass. Kara quickly ends up joining forces with a man named Patrick, a widower and brother of a friend, and I found that bit rather strange and unnatural too considering the previous turn of events which I will not ruin.It should be noted that I figured out who the killer was pretty early on. It should also be noted that I am not at all good at these things. I can only assume that it was pretty darn obvious.The narration is done by Dick Hill and Susie Breck. I liked the fact that there were two narrators but Dick Hills voices werent very distinctive and his males all sounded like the same man, except for the killer. His killer voice was over the top, bordering on silly. Still, the story was definitely creepy and it was a page-turner so Ill give it a solid 3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TOTAZ6ERQJJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597377007#wasThisHelpful","R1TOTAZ6ERQJJH","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I started The Devils Detective I knew it might be a bit of a challenge. Its been described as bleak and has also been compared to Clive Barker and though Ive always adored Barkers work, Ive always had to give him my 100% attention because his stuff is rich with description and layer upon layer of dread.Im not going to lie. This book made me work. Its filled with a despair that I just cant put into words. The author painstakingly recreates Hell as a place youd never, ever want to visit but not because there is some evil entity setting your bottom on fire. No, in this version of Hell you dont even know why youre here so theres not even a sense of I was a monster. I deserve this. You arrive with no memory, are given a job and then youre not allowed to do it properly. Talk about an exercise in frustration! Your existence is one of despair, tedium and malaise. And thats all there is.The story follows an Information Man called Fool who is dispatched to investigate the dead bodies that turn up in Hell (it is Hell and overrun with demons, after all). Fool catalogues endless crimes and murders but no one follows up on any of it until one day he runs across a body whose soul appears to have been eaten. Deliciousness! But thats weird, even in Hell, so The Powers that Be get their ears all perked up and Fool is given a mission as well as a forbidden smidge of hope that maybe, perhaps this one case will be one hell actually get to solve.The best part about this book is the imagery. The characters, if Im being honest, are rather uninteresting. Theres a female or two and theyre pretty useless creatures, whining and wailing and lamenting and carrying on. Meh, go away. I have no patience for you. A livelier Fool wouldve made this one go down easier but hes too bland for my taste. The descriptions are 100% what kept me reading but at a bit of a snails pace. I never felt an undying urge to keep going to see if he solved the mystery but keep going I did. I dont regret it though because as I said the imagery and savagery is worth the time.He raised his head, feeling something that had to be blood roll down the side of his face. He lifted a hand to it, finding a short tear just below his hairline, another wound that would scar to a keloid ridge and add to the story of his time here, a story written across his skin in the language of Hell.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S7YX1PKGC7W5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539347#wasThisHelpful","R1S7YX1PKGC7W5","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 1/2 StarsI listened to this as an unabridged audiobook read by Flinty Williams who has the most lovely, lilting English accent. I read this cold and I think it best if you do so too so this is going to be super brief.It starts off a little weird and I like weird so I was hooked. It seems that children are being overseen by military men who keep them locked in cells, removing them only for their school lessons, but only after theyve been strapped into wheelchairs. Ummm, what the hey is going on here?Im not going to tell you. But when you figure it out its rather unsettling to say the least.The dulcet tones of Flinty Williams, along with the intriguing beginning, grabbed me but it was the humanization of the characters that kept me going even when some poo hits the fan and things started to get a little too bogged down in survival action for my personal liking.This was a fantastic story with a beginning I loved and adored though I do wish more time had been spent at the school and it has excellent characterization. Youll probably hate some of em though (but whats an adventure without a few baddies? BORING, thats what!).  From the beginning, you cant help but sympathize with Miss Justineau and Melanie and they are two characters who will linger with me for a while.Theres even some fun bits of sarcastic dialogue amidst all of the fear, anxiety and fighting for their lives. And who can't use a little sarcasm in their lives?I will leave you with my favorite line.Do I have to punch you in the head again?","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D8QBCFYJGY8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFEW60O#wasThisHelpful","R1D8QBCFYJGY8O","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love tea tree oil. It has natural disinfectant properties and I always add a few drops to my homemade bathroom cleaner. My teen daughter, who has very sensitive skin, swears by it to keep her skin clear. She uses a ""tea tree"" cleanser from Trader Joe's and dabs a bit of this (just a wee bit) on any blemish that crops up and finds it to be much less irritating than the benzoyl peroxide that I swear by. She also adds a bit to her shampoo bottle to improve scalp conditions. She used to suffer from dandruff when using chemical laden products but no longer! She makes a hair mask by mixing olive & tree tea oil and believes it makes her hair soft and less brittle. I have to believe this is true because she bleached part of her naturally black hair to blonde and I feared it'd break off or look as if she'd stuck her finger in an electrical socket but the blonde is still healthy and strong with no breakage even after she left the bleach on for nearly 90 minutes (ouch). She uses this combo at least once a week and leaves it on for an hour or so.This is a super versatile natural option and a little goes a long way so this bottle will last us a good while even though we use it often. Next up is dabbing it on the dog beds to improve the scent (not that my dogs smell or anything . . . !) and to deter fleas as someone here mentioned. I dislike putting flea repellent on their skin so I'll give this a go.

"This is a cute container that is perfectly sized for a homemade batch of ice cream made with my Cuisinart ice cream machine. It has a cute printed design on the front which is oddly left out of the description and the picture here. It took me aback when it arrived because I thought I was buying a plain white container but it doesn't bother me. I just wish I had known what it was exactly I was buying  beforehand. The cover, as others have said, does not provide an air tight closure. Fortunately, my kids usually eat it up before it gets freezer burned but not always.

"4 1/2 StarsSpun is a novella, 2 hrs 47 mins (or 140 pgs), and is a spin-off of a previous book called Spin. I havent read Spin yet (but plan to now) and had no problem following this story. I wish all attached stories could manage to do this.Amber is a former child star struggling to get her life together. She is the classic tale of child star turned wastrel. She fell in love with a bad boy, has been in and out of rehab for drug and alcohol addiction, has a strained relationship with her parents, ruined all but the lamest of career opportunities with her on-set bad behavior and instability and is now hounded by the paparazzi who want nothing more than to see her continued downfall.Amber has made a complete mess of her life and she knows it. She doesnt deny it, she doesnt get all poor me and she doesnt lay the blame on any one but herself. Shes trying to do whats right even though its probably the most difficult thing shes ever faced. This is why I liked Amber right away. She has managed to stay sober for two years and has avoided the former love of her life for over six months because he is her kryptonite. But then shes dealt a devastating blow to the heart, forced to face betrayal after betrayal and has a family who doesnt have any faith that she is actually sober. This story is about the roughest patch of Ambers young life.Amber is never unlikable, shes just a mess. At this point in her life, shes vulnerable and facing so many betrayals that you hope shes able to come out of it with her sobriety and her sanity intact. I really felt for her, even teared up once or twice, if you can believe that. Told from Ambers POV you see the entire devastating mess from Ambers POV and you really feel her pain. She even managed to maintain a self-deprecating sense of humor about herself and her life that always kept the book from being completely dreary as Amber struggles to deal with becoming a stable adult.I enjoyed this story and the breezy (but not immature) writing style. If youre into audiobooks and this sort of dramatic story, this is a great choice. The narrator drew me in and kept me. Her voice sounds world weary but still young enough and I never felt jolted or lost when other characters spoke.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12ACVHDH1C5RR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMD7A6C#wasThisHelpful","R12ACVHDH1C5RR","A3N6JG64P2G9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6JG64P2G9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Ravenna cover will fit a square fire pit smoothly.  Just make sure the measurements are okay.  It is a sold grey cover with  little band of lighter gray stitching.  It is made of a tough durable material, that is sturdy enough to withstand the elements.  There are plastic fasteners to fit around the bottom legs of the pit but what is best about the fit are the cords at the bottom which can be tightened. There are also side flaps that allow air flow to keep mildew from growing.  It is easy to take one and off.

"So often when protagonists dislike each other, it is unbelievable that they would ever fall in love.  I personally have never met anyone who se hatred toward someone turned into love.  Sophie Jordan makes the I-dont-like-you-but want-you trope work because she explains why the leads fell out of like with each other and then she shows the reader how they fell back into like and love.Lady Aurelia is daring, too daring for a proper miss (this is the one aspect of her personality that goes a little too far for the time period, her escapades.)  She has no suitors and at first seems to be content to live with her brother and his wife in London.  Her main release from doldrums is to draw caricatures of the ton and leave them in opportune places to be discovered.Her family does not know of her drawings but Max, Viscount Camden, her brothers best friend does. Max and Aurelia are oil and water, they bicker constantly.  Neither one can hold their tongue and they lash out at each other, vitriol masks their desire for each other.  Both feel justified for their feelings but they dont really have insight into the others feelings.  Max has been hurt terribly by the death of his parents and Aurelia feels misunderstood and her art is not appreciated.This couple is explosive in almost every way.  They fight with passion and they love with passion.  The tension between them is palpable and the reader knows that they are sticks of dynamite ready to explode.  Nothing is done halfway.  In spite of their outward rantings about each other, their inner musings are more thoughtful and considerate.  The ending is a bit rushed and I wish this couple had shared more about their pasts.  Overall though a very entertaining read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH3JYPZ2O3COO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OOZL4KW#wasThisHelpful","RH3JYPZ2O3COO","A3M3W5GV0HIQK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M3W5GV0HIQK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not usually a big fan of modern day romances.  They seem rushed (the couple is in an intimate relationship way too fast) and they lack the tension I usually find in historical novels.  The Hotter You Burn fortunately takes it time developing characters without losing the fine tension between the leads.  This is a wonderful story.Harlow was the mean girl in junior high and high school.  Hurt people hurt others and Harlow lived this out.  She has a reputation as a troublemaker, boyfriend stealer and all around bad girl.  She is older now in her mid twenties and wanting to make some changes in her life.  Some are forced upon her, like being evicted from her home in her small Oklahoma town.Residing in her home are three hunks who are as close as brothers.  The one she is most attracted to is Beck, a love-em-and-leave-em man.  Beck is as complex as Harlow, having grown up in the foster care system, he has some commitment issues.Beck is attracted to Harlow but she is elusive and he finds himself wanting to help her.  He actually develops feelings for her quickly and it shocks him.  He is protective and possessive but he hates change and he feels that Harlow will flip his world upside down.  He is right.I loved Harlow; she is a spunky woman trying to turn over a new leaf.  I found her admirable in so many ways.  She doesnt make excuses for past actions, just determined to become a better person through kind acts.  She wants a stable relationship, totally understandable in light of her unstable past.  She is insightful and understanding and so wants to establish real friendships.Beck is so torn, he vacillates between wanting Harlow for himself and trying to be nobly minded and let her find happily ever after with someone better.  Beck feels he is just too flawed but he doesnt see that Harlow accepts him because she is flawed too and together they can have a flawed messy loving forever.The dialogue in this novel is superb.  Showalter has a natural ear for writing funny little quips and deep feelings.  I adored the leads but not everyone else in this novel.  Jessie Kay the new friend was a bit too much, too opinionated, too just about everything.  I think she has her own novel coming up and I am not interested in her story.  There are other secondary characters who have a better personalities.  This tale is about Beck and Harlow a worthy couple who find love in spite of their wounded souls.  Together they create a loving cocoon that ultimately mends their broken hearts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16C436P5GG8N4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373779690#wasThisHelpful","R16C436P5GG8N4","A3M3W5GV0HIQK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M3W5GV0HIQK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this two months ago for my husband battling pityrosporum folliculitis caused after courses of prednisone and antibiotics. I researched and bought a lot of products at the time, but my husband didn't feel safe about using colloidal silver. Using oil of oregano and turmeric along with good diet helped to manage his condition and we didn't want to try too many products at once and not figure out which was effective. Husband's PF is not cured and occasionally still flare up but he is still reluctant even after I assured him he wouldn't turn blue (argyria) using the nano-sized silver particle solution.In the meantime, my dog recently developed ear yeast infection, and using Zymox ear cleanser didn't help alleviate the problem with her increasingly itchy and shaking head. While I was waiting for an order of Zymox OTIC for her to arrive (and ultimately vet visit), I thought why not try the unopened bottle of Sovereign Silver? The dog wouldn't care if her skin turned blue. After a quick research that this is safe, I put a dropper full into each of her ear, and massaged the base of the canals and then removed excess. She shook her head once immediately after, and that was it! I did that yesterday morning, and one application of the silver solution miraculously stopped all her symptoms of itching and shaking head. She slept soundly through last night and didn't wake us up as she did for few days. I wasn't entirely sure of the efficacy of colloidal silver, but this is remarkable and I'm sold at least on topical application. Once my husband has to stop his course of oil of oregano (hard on liver), he just may try the colloidal silver after seeing how effective it was on our dog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HKO59ZZE8C5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OA6Z6O#wasThisHelpful","R3HKO59ZZE8C5U","A3EWW9I3WUEQXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EWW9I3WUEQXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:03 MinsThis is one of the most life changing devices I've ever purchased, so I've decided to post a video review. Our high-strung stubborn Siamese mix cat Coco started doing misdeeds in the house after I attempted to toilet train him with CitiKitty toilet trainer. Initially the training went well, but once the toilet bowl hole got much larger, Coco decided he wasn't going to have any of it, possibly due to water splash sound. Even after I conceded and gave his litter box back, he decided that sinks, baths, and anywhere other than his litter box were better places to pee/defecate in. This was greatly disturbing and my husband and I've tried everything possible to deter him from urinating around the house, especially bathroom tubs & sinks.We were feeling pretty hopeless when my desperate research found the PetSafe cat barrier. I've actually once tried a dog shock collar (Innotek Contain & Train) on Coco when we were trying to prevent him from entering an unsafe loft area, but the dog collar didn't even make him flinch at the highest shock setting for an unknown reason. Our expectations were low, yet we still had to at least try something else. We've already tried ScatMats (own 3), motion detection sprays/alarms (we got sprayed more...), physical barriers, gazillion other litters and boxes, etc. so why not just one more?  Coco is a very intelligent, active, and predatory indoor cat, and although we love him dearly we just couldn't continue to deal with him urinating wherever he pleased and the problem was getting worse with him defecating in our kitchen and guest beds (when the guests would leave doors open). Either he was going to be locked up in confinement or else...The posted video was taken on 11/2014, and I wanted to wait before writing a review to see how the system performed in the long run. After the first shock on the video, Coco hid under a coffee table for 3 hours and then he didn't approach the kitchen area for weeks. The beeping sound was his devil and he scurried back the other way with just that one correction on the video. My husband and I were ecstatic and bought total of 3 PIRF-100 transmitters for our open concept home.  We noticed that he started testing his boundaries and knew exactly where he was allowed and not, and after 3 months he found himself in the kitchen yet again when the battery finally drained. Coco is no longer scared of the beeping sound as he has figured out that he only gets zapped when the beeping intervals get faster. It's important to make sure that a cat can't make a quick dash through a shallow signal range for a tempting reward on the other side. I saw him doing this once, and we adjusted the transmitter location to end the behavior.I love the RFA-188 battery and it lasts 3 months pretty much on the dot with Coco constantly testing his boundaries, and he is the most vigilant cat you can imagine. I've only seen him get shocked twice, so I don't know how long the battery would last on cats that don't make proper association and get shocked more often. Rechargeable batteries lose hold power and drain rather quickly (weeks at max), so I love not having to worry for months and I have the batteries automatically delivered through subscribe and save. The battery seems pricey for what it is, but I'd rather have a functional collar for many years than having to replace a degrading rechargeable collar in few short years (as with my dog collars). After 10 months of use, Coco has been a very well behaved loving cat after he got banned from kitchen, bathrooms, and guest bedrooms after we took away his options to make mistakes. Here are some observations and tips:* The transmitter signal works through walls. Proper placement is necessary to avoid undesired correction, but it can allow you to protect multiple rooms in range with just one transmitter.* I do wish the transmitter was smaller as I was surprised it was unexpectedly large at about 9 "" in diameter. However, I like the fact that you can adjust the signal range through the adjustment dial, and capable of larger perimeter than my other dog's smaller indoor barrier transmitter without adjustment option. The transmitter uses about 5 watts of power on full signal measured through an electricity usage monitor. It is definitely noticeable, as people always ask ""what's this?"" but you can opt to hide it in a cabinet, etc.* Precise delimiter with visual association aids in training - place the transmitter so that a cat can associate the visual boundary along with the beeping sound at least initially. You should test walking around with the collar in your hand so that it'll beep as soon as a cat enters a room, etc. Coco had no problem figuring out his precise boundaries without visual cues later on, but he is a very quick learner. You can use the flag training method described in the manual, or use chalk lines, ropes, door entries, etc. for appropriate training based on your cat's temperament.* Coco has a very high pain threshold. He has had two cancer surgeries (cured) since we've rescued him and having experienced stomatitis & Bartonella left him quite pain tolerant. He wrestles and tumbles around with dogs and takes dog bites, brush off, and asks for more action. After seeing Coco's response to the shock, I simply cannot imagine any cat that wouldn't respond as long as the static correction level is set properly and the prongs make proper contact with the skin. I did trim his fur near the prong contact, but tried that  once on the first day after only reading the ""Indoor Radio Fence"" manual (with dog pic on the front) that comes packed with the transmitter, which is obviously also used for dogs and failed to mention anything about adjusting collar correction level other than checking batteries. I later found the instruction for adjusting the static correction level in a separate manual that was hidden/sandwiched in the hard-to-open plastic clamshell cat collar packaging. PetSafe needs to do a better job at incorporating manuals rather than including inadequate generic instructions for separate system parts that can frustrate people. Upon discovering the instruction, I prematurely raised the correction to max level 5 (level 1-5) for ""High Energy"" cat only because I was just about to return the product in defeat, and assumed the max level would still be too weak for Coco. I was wrong...* I was initially concerned with the possibility of Pressure Necrosis on his neck with constant collar prong contact, but so far there had been no problem with him wearing it 24x7 for over 10 months. I still do examine him often to ensure safety, and learned that his favorite thing in the world now is when I scratch or brush under his collar. This activity actually ended up increasing our bond and he seeks contact more often and purrs louder than he ever did.* Amazon doesn't always have the best price, so be sure you google search for PIRF-300C for the lowest price. Got mine through RadioFence with coupon at significant discount.I wish I had this device a long time ago. Some people may feel that shock collars are cruel, but misbehaving defiant pets could easily face much worse fate when owners give up. I've had subservient cats that behave with simple verbal corrections, but Coco and most cats are definitely not one of the few. I am extremely grateful how effective this device had been and it practically changed our lives. Coco doesn't have to get locked up when guests visit, and we no longer worry about leaving doors open accidentally whether to keep rooms sanitary or to keep him and other animals safe. We knew there had to be answers to our prayers to keep our beloved pet around with as much freedom for as long as we could. I hope the device would work as successfully for other pet lovers dismayed in similar conundrum.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R373W0FNQFPNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0075RGCFI#wasThisHelpful","R373W0FNQFPNM","A3EWW9I3WUEQXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EWW9I3WUEQXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you own nonstick pans, you must absolutely get these.  I've been using ceramic nonstick pans for healthier cooking and it's been amazingly frustrating cleaning the stuck/burnt food off the white nonstick surface.  I've been using many other non scratching dish washing scrubbing sponges, and no matter how hard I scrubbed the burnt food mark remained on the pans. When I resorted to using Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, the burnt marks came off like magic, but so did the nonstick quality of the pans, ruining the pans.  I tried these after I replaced my ruined nonstick set, and OMG these are simply amazing!  The scourer doesn't scratch the surface, but the baked/burnt food came off without much effort! I couldn't believe what I was seeing so I tried with my old sponge on a burnt mart, and not much happened although I scrubbed as hard as I could. Tried the same mark with this cloth again, and the burnt mark came off without effort! This just blew my mind and I ended up immediately buying more and started gifting to family/friends. Just be aware that you'll probably receive products branded and packaged by different Korean companies, like my photo shows. I've been using a yellow one for about a month now and it's still going strong.

"This is by far the best cleanser you can buy at drug stores. I've been using CeraVe for many years and I've never stuck to a cleanser for as long in my many decades (eh-hem) of living. I used to buy expensive brand cleansers and still do experiment once in a while, but I always come back to CeraVe for my oily and now aging combo skin. This cleanser is much more costly at retail stores, so Amazon's is definitely the way to go especially if you purchase through subscribe&save as I do. My husband has normal skin in his 50s and he also enjoys using CeraVe. This cleanser is gentle but it also cleans thoroughly. Be gentle with your skin. The more you scrub and aggravate it with drying agents and peels, the more sebum it'll produce to balance it out. What you eat also matters greatly, and healthy diet definitely contributes to healthier skin. Do NOT believe the scientific studies that say otherwise - for many decades the studies insisted there was no relationship and only recently the status had changed to unclear and under debate. My skin was most troubled and oiliest when I was using ton of products that supposedly help. The worst breakout I experienced was when I was eating fries and cheese almost everyday for lunch, and all that problem went away when I started eating healthier with limited sugar, which improved liver functions and ultimately better immune response. Although there are other factors such as hormonal, and body chemistry differences, the least you can do is to be kind to your body for best chance of healing. Although most people assume I'm decades younger than my age, I wish I had started exercising and eating healthier even earlier.

"This is a good pair of multi-function scissors. I bought two sets of scissors by different brands at the same time, and initially hated the one made by More Cuisine since it arrived damaged and the scissors would not meet correctly for cutting. I contacted the seller G&G MKTG GR, and received a stellar service in receiving a replacement right away. Now the two brands perform (the other more well-known) exactly same and look almost identical except for the color. More Cuisine's is made with 100% pure silicone that's specified dishwasher-safe, while the other brand notes hand washing is recommended.  For some reason, the item didn't come with any instructions so here are the parts explanations. The scissors come apart for thorough cleaning when fully open near 90 degrees. I'm calling it part A for the scissor with the smaller hole, and B for the larger hole scissor side.1. Nut Cracker - between the handles2. Bottle opener - on top of A's handle3. Screw driver - on top of B's handle.  Useful for pry opening metal cans, lifting lids, etc.4. Bone cutter -  the blade indentation/notch on A's blade allows to cut small bones or wires without dulling blade5. Slicer -  A's blade. Not sharp enough for peeling apples or use as a paring knife, but ok for slicing lemons, open Amazon boxes, etc.6. Fish scaler - back of the blade on A. You probably won't use unless you buy whole fish.7. Peeler - the long hole on B blade. Useful for stripping herbs, such as cilantro, rosemary, etc. I found I can completely remove tendons off chicken breast tenders by pulling the tendon through the hole.8. Magnetic holder - this one is obvious. I have it attached to my magnetic dry erase board since it won't stick to brushed stainless refrige of mine. This is a nice bonus since it helps me to find the scissors...as long as I put it back.Kitchen shears are indispensable item in my kitchen. I use them to trim off chicken fats, tendons (especially those pesky ones on chicken breast tenders), cut open packages, and you simply can't have enough scissors around home, period. It's nice to have a pair that come with extra functions as bonus. You should be mindful handling these because one side will drop and possibly mar the floor if you only hold only one handle and allow them to open up - I know, because I've dropped it twice already...","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DATQWQ9Q09PB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V6H0Y34#wasThisHelpful","R1DATQWQ9Q09PB","A3EWW9I3WUEQXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EWW9I3WUEQXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been avoiding pre-diabetes for a long time and resorted to mostly avoiding carbs. However, I ended up looking very gaunt on my face due to my ketogenic diet and had to resort to adding some slow digesting carbs and beans. The steel cut oats are great for adding carbs to my diet since they have low glycemic index (42 versus 66 in instant oatmeals) to avoid blood sugar spikes. I love that they're much nuttier and chewier than instant oats, and they're very tasty with just adding cinnamon powders (reduces blood sugar) and fruits/berries along with a bit of coconut butter for healthy breakfast.

"This was my first grown hen feeder and I initially thought it functioned fine not knowing any better, but I quickly realized I needed a lid/cover to prevent water from wetting the feed through the top. Although the feeder was hung under a tarp on a run, windy rain often entered from sides of the run to spoil the feed. I then bought a larger Little Giant feeder (with my hand-made plastic bowl lid) and noticed it had curved-in lip on the base rim that noticeably reduced feed spillage in comparison to Harris Farms'.

"My HP Pavilion Slimiline s5280t PC was found dead one morning, and I was able to determine the problem was its toast power supply with burnt smell. Ordered this reasonably priced part and received the item quicker than anticipated - Kudos to the seller. Replacing the part was easy (I've never done this before and there were no instruction) as I've replaced cable connections one by one, and simply did not use extra cables/connections that came with the part that my original part didn't have. I felt proud when the computer turned on and I was able to resurrect the dead PC all by myself, but then noticed that the fan noise is a LOT louder than my original HP part. The part's fan runs as if the CPU is on 100% full usage while the PC is over 98 percent idle. I decided then it was time for me to do a thorough backup and look for a replacement PC for my 6 yr old PC.  The part allowed me to salvage my data, which I'm grateful for, but I can't have my office sounding like an IT server room indefinitely.

"This is the best shelf instant udon noodle soup I've tried. I've had similar tasting store-bought udon noodles in the past, but they were found in the refrigerator section of asian grocery stores. I received the order on May 30, 2015 and they're labeled good until 02/23/2016, so I assume these have about 1 year shelf life without requiring refrigeration. I've purchased 6 for $15.99 so the noodles were definitely worth the cost at 2.67 dollars each for satisfying my cravings for real restaurant udon noodles, or even better than some mediocre restaurant udons. The dried flakes were very mushy when I followed the printed instructions, so I'd recommend that you add the flakes after microwaving.Update 8/2015: I've tried Nong Shim's Fresh Udon Noodles today and it was nowhere near as good as JFC's.

"I've had the original Cling-A-Wing feeder for years and I enjoyed having it attract chickadees, golden finches, titmouse, and even occasional cardinals while deterring sparrows and other larger birds from emptying the seeds. Over the years, the clear plastic turned color to yellowish cast, and it unfortunately fell off the two story window to its demise. I've always felt the refill was tough because of its small opening, but decided to order another set. When I received the set of 3 feeders, I was surprised to see the new design with a frosted plastic cap on refill opening rather than the rotating clear plastic layer, and the refill opening still remained too small. Typical funnels won't help as the seed mass gets blocked easily and you'll need to find one large enough to match the diameter of the opening, or end up using a home-made paper funnel as I did. However, I began to hate it after a few refills, after the plastic cap weathered lightly on a east-facing window and got almost impossible to take off. I'm pretty fit and strong but I have to struggle to pull on at least 3 corners to to take off the unattractive cap to refill the seeds. Because of the difficulty, I now rarely refill the feeder and have 2 additional spares that I no longer use. Duncraft messed up on the newer design and I hope they go back to older design or at least make it easier to refill in the future.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P0TF435SK7L3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2FM0S2#wasThisHelpful","R1P0TF435SK7L3","A3EWW9I3WUEQXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EWW9I3WUEQXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a very low expectation for this order, but I needed a crate that I could transport easier than my large metal crate. I remained ambivalent even after receiving the product thinking that if my dog really wanted to, she'd rip through the cloth cage in seconds. I have been crate/potty training my recently rescued adult dog that I've known for about a month. After assembling the soft crate, I put a few treats inside and had her go in to get the treats. I closed the front mesh door zipper after a few times of treating/praising, and I gently corrected her when I saw the 50 lbs dog trying to push through the mesh with her snout. When she quit, I opened the zipper and praised her, and repeated this a few times. The order was received just a day before our planned trip, so I didn't have much time to reinforce her to get used to the new crate. I highly recommend that you measure the inside dimension of your car to make sure that you can fit the crate in it before ordering. Most large soft crates sold were too tall to fit in my SUV's cargo area, so I chose this product at 25"" height although my dog's sitting posture height is at 30"" to the top of the head, 24"" to the withers and 35"" long to her hip. She is still able to enter, turnaround, and lounge easily. I did not trust the crate for 4 hours long road trip so I had the dog buckled in next to me for the drive while my husband drove, but the real test came during the overnight stay at my husband's parents' house. I used the crate just as the metal crate back at home for her to sleep in at night, but she had to stay in a separate room (due to a family member's allergy) away from where we slept. To my surprise, she stayed in the crate without any incident and properly went to potty outside as soon as she was released in the morning. I was so proud of her for accepting the routine, fell in love with the crate then, and I was very happy that I took the chance at the low priced lightweight crate. I believe it is important that your dog is somewhat crate trained before attempting a soft crate, and I wouldn't yet trust the crate for daytime confinement when she's excited. I still use the larger metal crate in our bedroom but left this soft crate out in another room where I tend to stay, and she prefers to her nap in it as seen on the photo. I use a lightly padded fleece mat I previously found at Walmart for less than twenty dollars that happened to fit well, which adds to comfort and cleanup. I will have no concern the next time we travel or stay over at a hotel/friend's place, since she has accepted the crate as her den and part of her daily routine. At only fifty dollars, this was such a bargain!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJN3DNHCW91T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018MM8RC#wasThisHelpful","R3BJN3DNHCW91T","A3EWW9I3WUEQXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EWW9I3WUEQXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It worked beautifully through a long trip, and I was able to to readily adjust the length of the tether whether I wanted to allow for sitting, standing, or keep my 50 lbs dog in down position.

"This is no doubt a very beautiful hummingbird feeder and I love that it has a classic antique look. I have over 2 dozen hummingbird feeders and this is the most beautiful of them all, but it is also the least used. I now occasionally use it for decorative purpose on my front porch, but the feeder is not the easiest to fill nor clean. The bottle mouth is too small for reliable filling without a funnel, and the extreme curvature inside the bottle makes it difficult to clean well with my brush tool. In addition, I've gotten a deep cut on my index finger from cleaning the underside of the metal base that has the feeding ports. There's razor sharp metal ridge where the bottle mouth meets the base, so please be careful while cleaning or you'll end up with a painful cut on your finger tip that tends to heal very slow. If not for the ease of maintenance, I would've given this feeder as presents for many of my friends and relatives. Hummers are drawn to the bottle, and they often perch on the edge of the metal base rim although the feeder lacks visible perch.

"Just bought this today at a local grocery stores on sale for $6.99 for 10 oz and my two dogs absolutely love it!Individual treat pieces are about 3 inches long and they're soft enough for me to easily break them up into smaller pieces.My dogs are finicky and they turn up their noses on many training treats and hard to get them motivated, so I'm going to get more of these while on sale and cut them into 1/4 pieces to use them as training treats. The treats smell amazing like smoked/grilled teriyaki steaks, and made my mouth water.

"This is a seriously overpriced item. I bought this to install it on a larger french mistress box, but the product really should cost no more than 5-8 bucks for what it is. You will need to drill about a 1/2"" hole on your box to properly install the plate so that the tripod mount side is completely flush with the tripod plate for stability. For my mistress box with a thick panel (Richeson), I ended up drilling halfway and then carefully carved out a hole just enough to bury the center head screw, and used 4 wood screws to secure the plate instead of using the supplied bolts and nuts meant to be installed through the bottom panel. If my box panel were thinner, I would've been in trouble since the bolts and nuts would've protruded into the base glass palette area. For most smaller pochade boxes with thinner boards, you can use some cheap 1/4-20 x 1/4"" tee nuts you can buy on Amazon (or hardware stores) along with a wood panel piece to screw on to the box.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NHCFEQYULN5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049V1EQK#wasThisHelpful","R2NHCFEQYULN5X","A3EWW9I3WUEQXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EWW9I3WUEQXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was hoping that CJ's review on 2012 would be outdated by now but it's not. It's 3 years later, but somehow the same inconsistency persists. The sketch box package photo shows the Amazon's ad pic with 1 covered brush compartment, but the contained sketch box has 5 compartments without a brush compartment cover. The wooden box was dented and scratched up a bit although its packaging box was pristine. The box's actual dimension is 12.75"" x 9.75"" (not 9.5""), the internal dimension is 9 x 12 (1/16"" short on both), and the lid doesn't open fully and stays up at about 97 degrees supported by the rear hinges. I bought some 1/4-20 x 1/4"" tee nuts to mount this box onto a tripod to make it into a plein air pochade box, but the top and the bottom panels are no thicker than 1/8"" thin boards so I had to get creative by adding a wood panel piece to install/attach the tee nut to the very thin board. The box is inexpensive enough but I would've liked the ad photo box instead.

"Well, I just HAD to try this after seeing many Youtube videos (buldak bokkeum myun or fire noodle callenge) of people trying this ramen. I can take spice pretty well, but even then I was a bit scared to try this assuming it's probably a sadistically hot inedible product aspiring fame through people's agony. With the cooked ramyun bowl in front of me, I breathed in deep, meditated a little, and then took the first bite. I must say I was both disappointed and relieved at the same time. It was not nearly as spicy as I had expected, and it was quite tasty! The sauce flavor is akin to the popular Korean dish Ddukbokki, except it's a little more savory (chicken?) and spicier. The sweetness tapers down the level of spice, and I finished the bowl without flinching although my nose pooled sweat long afterwards. As for a relevant gauge, if you enjoy and can eat Buffalo Wild's ""hot"" wings, then you won't have trouble finishing this. I also noticed that many people prep this noodle incorrectly and comment that it lacks flavor. The noodles won't lack flavor if you don't dilute it down by cooking it like other common ramen noodles. I noticed there's no English instruction on the received product anywhere, so I decided to post the translated cooking instruction:1. Boil 3 cups (or more) of water, and then cook the noodles for 5 minutes.2. Drain water (leave about 8 spoons worth), add the packaged liquid hot sauce, and then return to stove to stir the noodles at low heat for about 30 seconds.3. Turn off the stove, then mix in the dry sesame/seaweed package with the noodles.On step 1, I've boiled for 4.5 minutes instead for firmer noodles.Step 2 is important - you should pretty much drain off most of the water you see using your fork/chopsticks as strainer as you pour off excess water off your cooking pot, and you should have just enough water hidden in noodles for a saucy consistency, not liquidy. Stirring on heat with the hot paste incorporates the flavor and thickens the sauce. If you end up with too much juice, raise the heat a bit and evaporate off the water until the sauce thickens.When properly prepared, the sauce should be thick enough to coat the noodles and allow the sesame seeds to stick to the lifted noodles.I noticed that my received product's expiration date was less than 6 months away (8/30/2015). I will have no trouble finishing the noodles before the expiration, but it can be off-putting to buy any almost expired product. I'm not sure what the usual expiration is for the ramyun given the inclusion of the liquid paste, but the noodles didn't smell stale nor rancid as I could usually tell from almost stale ramyun noodles.All in all, this was very worth a try to resolve my curiosity after laughing so much at Youtube people's reactions, and I feel superior and stronger!oh~~ my stomach is starting to burn...Update: Curiosity got me to try the more convenient cup ramyun version of this (my packs were gone too soon!), and I prefer these cooking packets hands down. The cup noodles are much thinner and less chewy, and you don't get as savory deeper taste attained by cooking the liquid paste with noodles. The cup version's instruction tells you to drain off all water before adding the flavor packets, so you're definitely supposed to consume these with practically no liquid. The thicker noodles in the cooking packs need help to infuse the flavor in the step #2 above (the reason to leave some water to cook off), and you get 140g instead of 70g (small cup) or 105g (big cup) instant versions.

"I decided to try this bird house after sadly returning another window bird house made of green recycled plastic. The other bird house would not stay up on window and kept dropping by itself with just its own weight, and I almost gave up on trying another window house. This made out of cedar is lighter and much better made, and it also has 3 good quality suction cups, as to 2 on the other. It is so much more stable and has not moved since I've placed it on a window. I've stained/sealed it in redwood tone to improve longevity outdoor, and also put clear tapes over the side top half-moon holes; I'm pretty sure these are there to improve light (for viewing) than for ventilation, and I didn't want rain to enter through the side holes. I've learned that mirror viewing films tend to scare nesting birds away, so I've taped a piece of black roofing felt on the inside of the window to simply flip up for viewing later. It was practically impossible to view my chickadee nest in a birdhouse the past season, so I can't wait to get a better view with this product.

"I was hoping this product would be at least as delicious and fragrant as some of the common vending machine coffees I've tasted in Korea. The most fragrant coffee I've tried was actually at a small cafe in Korea, so I had to try this based on the reviews here. Although individual packaging is convenient, the coffee flavor is nothing extraordinary and falls flat compared to my expectation. You can prepare a similar tasting coffee with Coffee Mate + sugar combined with one of the more popular instant coffees in the US,  If you're looking for convenient sweetened premixed individual packaging at about .22 cents a pack (to mix in with 1/2 cup hot water), then this might be worth a try.

"I've been using human tartar scraper that you often see in dentist's office to clean my dog and cats' teeth for years since they were puppy/kittens. It's significantly tougher to clean more defiant cats' teeth but it helps to use a large towel to wrap the cats in a burrito fashion and strap the cat burrito with an adjustable belt (OK PETA, I don't need a call). If you're squeamish or lack the dexterity to do this, you'll need to spend hundreds a year to keep your pets healthy through regular vet visits, and be under the expense and mercy of anesthesia's side effects. I've just tried this new tartar scraper that doesn't look like a captain's hook, and I noticed that it allows for a safer scraping angle and it's much easier to use than a hook shaped scraper with a pointy end. Healthy gums won't bleed as much and the pets won't flinch dangerously if the gums are not painfully inflamed from accumulated tartar, so I end up semi-torturing my beloved pets pretty often with the towel burritos for their sake.

"My eyes were suddenly crusty with yellow discharge when I woke up in the mornings and I noticed slimy clear substance that I could pull out in long strings out my eyes. I thought perhaps I may have contracted a minor infection and decided to try this product while waiting to see my opthamologist on a delayed appointment. The eye drops did sting a bit but they were tolerable. The day after the initial drops, I noticed significantly increased yellow discharge. After few more days of use, the yellow discharge and mucus inclusions completely went away and I was waking up with clear eyes again. Whatever the ailment was, the eye drops took care of it by the time I saw my Opthamologist. When I asked about the symptoms after my healthy eye exam, he said it could've been anything such as allergy or seasonal irritation. I showed him the Eyebright drops bottle for his opinion, and he said the ingredients are safe to use as he saw nothing harmful. I asked about the msm (sulfur) that some of the reviewers complain about, and he said the ingredient is perfectly safe for most people who are not allergic to sulfur (cabbabe, broccoli, cauliflower, etc). As for the eye floaters that some reviewers report of clearing, I already knew the answer but the Dr. confirmed that there's no supplement that will make eye floaters go away; However, the larger floater segments can break to smaller pieces and become less noticeable in time. For those buying this to clear floaters - please don't waste your money. I've done my research on this since I had floaters since I was a child. Eyebright herb, which I've also tried ingesting, may improve eye health and possibly prevent worsening of floaters, but the only procedure to clear existing floaters is an operation called Vitrectomy (strain out eye fluid with surgical needles) for bad enough cases only. For those with eye irritations, this product may be worth a try. I found out MSM actually provides many eye benefits that you can easily google to research, as do other included ingredients Grapefruit Seed Extract and Apple Cider Vinegar (probably what causes the stings). I can't call this product soothing, but it helps with eye strains and irritations and my eyes do feel more refreshed after the initial stings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20QQ604KN14RV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004THC2SS#wasThisHelpful","R20QQ604KN14RV","A3EWW9I3WUEQXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EWW9I3WUEQXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use this directly on a Lowe's 2 gallon bucket along with chicken nipple waterer (threaded style oasis poultry water nipples) to function as an automatic waterer. It works perfectly to stop any water overflow and I like the adjustable arm to modify the water level as needed. My initial shipped valve was missing the compression nut ferrule to allow for 1/4 tubing to stay on water-tight, so you may want to check for any missing part as soon as you get the valve. I control the water refill time at the spigot with a digital water timer (Orbit 91213), so I can't attest to how the product would fare in the long-run under constant water pressure, and this will probably be dependent upon your incoming water pressure. Our water main (location where water enters house) psi is set at 75 (was initially at 50 psi), and the float valve works just fine to stop any water overflow whenever I've tested. I avoid having water hose left under pressure since I've lost a few of our garden hoses that way (especially after we increased to 75 psi to improve shower) along with costly water waste. I would personally not risk such failure especially for indoors, so check your psi and use a timer if possible or at very least use a pressure regulator and/or partially open your spigot valve to lower water pressure. I use all three measures - pressure regulator, timer, and float value. It's better to be safe than sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M0B8G16OUQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077RAX4W#wasThisHelpful","R2M0B8G16OUQ5","A3EWW9I3WUEQXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EWW9I3WUEQXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I could do so with these gloves, but it was uncomfortable after 10 or 15 seconds. Given I couldn't do it at all without these gloves, I can affirm they provide some protection. But I think it is more for non-submersed cases where the little nubs keep the heat away from most of the glove.The gloves are identical left/right.

"These headphones sound good, are comfortable, and affordable.I use these when working around the house (doing dishes, cleaning up) and find the Bluetooth feature wonderful. The sound is decent with enough bass for music to sound good. They aren't ""wonderful"", but are very good and I have no complaints about the sound. I'm moving about so concentrating on hearing a finger slide on a guitar string isn't what these are for.They stay in my ears just fine although I don't know what the loop is for. It seems a but useless. I tuck in under the fold in my ear but honestly can't tell you it makes them any more secure. They fit fine and don't fall out.They seem to work for at least three hours or so and take a few hours to recharge.

"I received these as a review sample free of charge in exchange for an honest review.I tried them for a week or so and don't use them. While the sound is fine, I found them inconvenient to use and they felt ""unfinished"" from a design perspective.The good:- The sound was fine. Nothing wonderful, but good enough for listening while moving around.- The earbuds were comfortable.- The charge lasts several hours.The not so good:- The wires are a bit short. If I move around actively, the part on my shoulders rotates enough to pull on the earbuds even when they are pulled out their maximum amount.- The controls are not intuitive. Volume up/down and next/prior track are easy to confuse. I can't quickly find on/off without looking. The controls are somewhat symmetric, so buttons on the left mimic those on the right and you have to remember which is where.- The voices change. Some of the prompts (headphones on, ready to pair, etc.) are in ""unaccented"" English, others are strongly accented. Still understandable and fine, but it would give a better use experience if it was all in one voice.- The writing molded into the headphones (e.g. on/off, +/-) isn't crisp. Legible, but not a sign of quality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCBV50BJMEB1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KD6WIG#wasThisHelpful","RCBV50BJMEB1E","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very good replacement bulbs for some track lighting I have in the kitchen. However we are not using them, so I can't give them a great endorsement.1) The bulbs were much bluer than we anticipated. Others talks about the color being off and that may very well be the case. Perhaps if I had gotten the 2700K bulbs it would have been better.2) Our track lighting fixtures have a glass back that gives a warm glow from some light leakage from the traditional bulbs. These LED bulbs have no such leakage (perhaps good in many cases) so they appear dull from the back. There are two pictures included with this review. In the first the fixture (in the foreground) is shown from the back and is on even though it looks off. The second picture is at a very short exposure so the room looks dark but this is done so that lights are not over-exposed. The light on the left is the traditional bulb; that on the right the LED bulb. Note how the traditional bulb is all aglow. This looks nicer overall and provides some light on the ceiling around the fixture (the third picture has a slightly longer exposure; note the light on the ceiling). The LED bulb is just the disk and the contrast between the disk and the darkness behind it makes it a bit glaring.3) These bulbs are a little bit longer than the bulbs they replaced, perhaps 2 or 3 mm. Ours have a screw-on ring and you might be able to see in the first picture that it doesn't quite go on all the way.I may try the 2700K bulb, but am reluctant because, even though the color might be right, the fixture might not look as warm and attractive.I received two bulbs in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35V914ODSLASH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZG144XM#wasThisHelpful","R35V914ODSLASH","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great model for a child or Star Wars enthusiast. This is easy enough to put together (15 to 30 minutes) and is solid enough to withstand being played with. It is prepainted so no disappointment from smeared paint or foggy windshields. My nine year old was able to put it together easily and it is a great size to play with and pretend it is flying about.The only thing I can add to the other reviews is that my son was initially disappointed that it wasn't a Lego kit. The box graphic is similar in style to Lego (although clearly it isn't) and his initial impression was it was Lego caused some disappointment. Once he figured out what it was, that he could put it together, and that it had sounds and actually was a bit more realistic without all the bumpy Lego artifacts, he was quite happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QZTVQ8GJ0YIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125KV5T2#wasThisHelpful","R1QZTVQ8GJ0YIJ","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dot is cute and for a robot that doesnt move, shes got quite the personality. (To me, the voice and name sound feminine, but technically Dot is ungendered.) The software and hardware are generally well done, however there are some sticking points that make it less than ideal.If you have the money, go for Dash over Dot. I think Dash can do everything Dot can do  and also move. But Dot is surprisingly fun on her own.The good:1) Dot looks kind of cool with the lights in the eye and ears.2) The software clearly has a lot of thought put into it. It is graphically great for kids to look at.3) There are many options for sounds, lights, and links. Robot will respond to sound, voice, tilting, and button presses. Random elements are also included. You can even record your own sounds and use that.4) There is a great deal of thought going into the training exercises. I think there are still some bugs/improvements to be made, but it is generally good.5) My daughter found it to be cute and engaging.The bad:1) No volume control. Just one loud volume. Forget about a kid playing when the other is trying to sleep or you are trying to drive. It would be nice if both sound and light intensity were adjustable.2) The training exercises are a bit rushed.a. Almost immediately after completing a training program you get You finished this step! Ready for the next one? (You can only select a check mark which takes you to the next.) What if I want to run that step again to see what happened? This is especially frustrating with the tilting exercises. You tilt Dot to make something happen and on to the next step. You cant tilt again to repeat, which you naturally want to do to verify something is working or to see how much you have to tilt for Dot to register it.b. When you complete a step you dont get a chance to practice it for the reason above. My son wanted to change the Disco Ball light order in an intermediate step but couldnt. This was an opportunity for him to reinforce what he just learned rather than just mimicking the prompt, and it isnt allowed. You can do so when the whole exercise is completed. If you do, youll end up at the front panel and find your place again.3) The language in some places can be a bit obtuse. When you link behaviors together, theyre called states. And the cool pictures we make with states and links are called state machines. Do we really need to know this? Does this help my 9 year old in any way? It is never mentioned again.4) The software really only works if you have one child playing with it (or if you have three devices with the software). I have three who might use it, but only one iPad. After the first child went through the learning exercises, the lessons were marked as completed. Subsequent kids didnt get the same training. They could go back manually, but that wasnt the same. Similarly all the tracking of projects and unlocking of new levels is done for everyone if one kid does it. I cant even find a way to reset things except for deleting and installing the software.5) Dot can be a bit sassy. There are some expressions kids cling on to and parents hate hearing. Dot does some of those. For example Im gonna go with, no6) Abilities are locked down until you achieve something through Scroll Quest. The advanced learner cant just unlock everything and go for it. One child went through it. I reinstalled so the other child could go through it, but they didnt finish, so they first had to go through everything again just so he could access the options at the level he was originally at.Also:1) Im not sure who Eli is (Dots name or someone else) but s/he shows up in the text of the software from time to time. It would be nice to be able to name my Dot.2) To be clear, although it is round, Dot does not move.3) My son was not as impressed as my daughter. He likes things that move (cars/tanks) so the voice and lights didnt do much for him. He was done with it pretty soon. Hed likely like Dash.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZJCM1PMLRP8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XDT7JO#wasThisHelpful","R1ZJCM1PMLRP8Q","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The box says ""The Right Quality and Size for Business"" and this is geared towards a small business.I can't help but compare this Georgia-Pacific product to what we've been using at home for a long time now:Scott Extra Soft Double Roll Tissue, 9 Count (Pack of 4). The price fluctuates, but what we use now soft and strong enough and typically very affordable. The Georgia-Pacific product is meant for businesses which have somewhat different requirements, but is great for home use too.The Georgia Pacific is full height roll, being a full 4.5 inches wide (more than a  inch wider than the Scott). It looks good on the dispenser (Scott looks skimpy) and provides better hand coverage. The cardboard core seems a bit stronger as well which might make a difference in a dispenser where they are stacked horizontally. Although it is 2-ply, it doesn't feel softer or stronger than the 1-ply Scott.Individual rolls are wrapped in tissue paper and attractive enough to leave an extra roll or two in a bathroom. Both claim to be a double roll but the Georgia-Pacific is 400 sheets per roll vs 264, so the Georgia-Pacific will last 50% longer per roll (assuming everyone uses the same number of sheets. Both have sheets that are 4 inches long), so fewer roll changes.Overall the Georgia Pacific seems well made and a solid choice and may have some advantages that make the slightly higher price worthwhile, especially for small businesses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PLZOMK6Q17LA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00706WGFY#wasThisHelpful","R3PLZOMK6Q17LA","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fairly large air purifier unit rated for a room that is around 200 square feet. If the room were square, that would be a room 14 to 15 feet on each side. So a decent sized room but not a very large one. I never believed the smaller units did much so I'm a bit gratified that their room size to purifier filter/flow ratio is more reasonable. My son, who suffers from allergies (we have cats and dogs) often has trouble sleeping which wakes him up early. He seems to be sleeping longer with this unit on, so we are hopeful.This comes with the allergy filter, which includes a dust filter, HEPA, and activated charcoal filter. It is thick and feels solid and takes up much of the area of the device, so that is what determined the size. The unit is large but not overwhelming and it is good looking so we are fine with it in his bedroom. It would look just fine in a living area as well. Setting it up was easy.It is also very quiet. There are five fan speeds and one can hear level levels 2 and above, but only 4 and 5 might be distracting in a quiet room. It is white noise, though, so typically not a big deal. On automatic the unit typically stays on level 1 and I have to make sure it is working by feeling the flow coming out of the back.My main concerns are:1. It reads the air quality but it shows the highest rating. Once it showed one red segment, but that was only briefly. I'd be more confident if it showed some more obvious improvement. I have no reason to believe the air in my home is particularly good, although we do use expensive air filters on our forced air system.2. It runs on the lowest fan speed or is off when in auto mode. I suppose because it senses the air is good, but I'd like to see it working more. It makes sense to not be on if the air is good, but then what's it doing?3. They don't tell you how to use it. I know how it works (sleep, auto, timer, etc.) but why not just leave it in auto mode all the time? I understand sleep makes it quiet, but is it different than having it on at the lowest fan setting? And why would I want it on a timer so it comes on before I get home from work? Or why have it shut off after a given number of hours? Is there some reason I don't want it running all the time? I understand the filter likely wears out with run time, but if it's cleaned the air too early, it shouldn't wear the filter much. I put it in Auto and am just leaving it on unless I can figure out otherwise.4. The filters are expensive, but at $100 aren't that unreasonable. Given we pay $5 for a Miele vacuum bag and $10 for a filter for our air system, it isn't outrageous if only changed once a season. I have no indication on how long it will last, but it would be reasonable if it lasted three or four months.5. (small issue). I wish there was a pocket or place for the remote on the device. It's not like you change it often, like you do a TV. Can't they have a pocket on the back? Or even some place on front that it would slide in and act like a control panel. It's just sitting on top, looking funny on an otherwise attractive unit. Like the too many remotes in our lives (we even have one for the lights in our pumpkins!), it is hard to find a place we'll remember it isn't used often and where the kids will put them back or leave them alone.Aside from the ""how to operate"" quirks, this is a well designed units that, at least initially, seems effective. I am an engineer and it seems to me that they've made all the right design choices. If any air filter is going to work, this one should.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIYJZNMGKJC9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010WVVZK0#wasThisHelpful","RIYJZNMGKJC9D","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This has worked very well for my family. Even with a power strip it was difficult to fit in all the micro USB and Lightning connectors to charge our devices (tablets, phones, Bluetooth headphones, fitness devices). The size of the AC adapters are such that you'd block more than one power socket with a single charger.This lets you plug in one thing and get 5 USB outputs. In one I put a cable for charging my iPad, in two others I put in micro USB chargers for my headphones and phone. That leaves a few for the kids to use when needed.Using the old adaptor I was using, if I was viewing a movie on my iPad and the battery would run low, plugging in to the standard adapter would slow down the discharge but wouldn't stop it if I continued to watch the movie. I'd have to stop watching and put the iPad to sleep to get it to charge. With this unit my iPad actually charges a little (very little!) but allows me to watch the rest of the movie at least without worrying about it eventually shutting down.Phones and other things are such low power that I don't notice any difference in power.This works great and is convenient. The only thing I recommend is to get some short cables to reduce the rat's nest of cables coming out. You don't need a 3'/6' cable. Get some 4 inch or 6 inch cables to make it a little neater. I wish they gave us a few cables instead of the USB light, but the light is kind of nice.I received this unit at no cost in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R166R41A92BUXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0148DKSDS#wasThisHelpful","R166R41A92BUXL","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are fans of Annie's mac and cheese products. When shopping at a conventional store, my 9 yo wouldn't let me buy what he called the ""cheap stuff"". I asked what he wanted and it was Annie's that he pulled off the shelf. We had tried Kraft out of nostalgia and he was having no more of that.Annie's typically has a better flavor and this is no different. I can't say I noticed the ""butter"", but it is in the ingredients. Whey is still very near the top, so it is still the dominant flavor.Shapes such as these can be harder to cook as they remain hard at the intersection. I typically take them out early. These suffer less from that because of the generally open profile of the shape. The kids like the shape, but no big deal.It is a 6 ounce box, which is typical for Annie's organic versions but less than the store brands.Many prepare this differently than stated on the directions. My take:While the pasta is boiling, I heat the milk and butter in a small sauce pan. I'll mix in the cheese mixture and make a smooth mixture, sometimes a little on the runny side. I take the pasta off when it is still firm, drain completely, and then add the cheese sauce. In a few minutes (burner off) the pasta will absorb some of the cheese sauce water, making it thick and finishing the cooking of the pasta. This avoids the clumpiness of mixing the cheese right in and also allows me to add other things as the mood hits me. It does have more clean up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R346BR4RJQZTVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IXRD84#wasThisHelpful","R346BR4RJQZTVE","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have some Calphalon pots and pans that are a decade or so old, stainless steel inside and out. Over the years they accumulated a brown varnish from cooking oil spills/splatters and dark black spots from who knows what. This pad did a great job of removing the varnish inside and out and, with some elbow grease, also removed the thicker black spots. It took some effort to remove the blackened bits, but they came off in the end. The pots look very good, with no scratches. These are cladded on the bottom with aluminum and the bottom (which touches the burner) has blackened over the years. These pads can remove some of that but it seemed like it would take a long time and wear out the pad to remove it all. I'm happy with the upper portion looking great and the very bottom having the blackened surface. I imagine if I wanted to get rid of the black on the bottom, I'd have to use something more abrasive; these pads won't do that.After two pots (a medium sized saucepan and a 12"" fry pan) the pad looks to be in great shape and should be ready to go for several more, which I plan to do as we use them.The pad has a very slim plastic coating on one side. One reviewer said it has tiny diamonds embedded in it, which I believe could be the case. It is a very fine scrubbing action and you feel resistance, but not scratching. It is best done wet and with some soap (as per the directions.)The direction also indicate that this isn't for food residue and such. Cleaning a greasy pot will clog the pad, so do that with something else. Then use this pad for one final pass to remove any varnish or burned-on material.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AOGZMZ9UH0QX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100DOSMW#wasThisHelpful","R1AOGZMZ9UH0QX","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As others have posted, this is two dice and five cards to add complexity/randomness to Fluxx.I would recommend this to folks who are:- Experienced players looking to breath life into a game they may be becoming less keen on- Folks who are ""expert"" players and understand the rules comfortably- Want less strategy and more randomnessI would not recommend these for:- New players- Games with people of mixed experience- People who wish to keep some strategy in the game.In my opinion, strategy is already a small part of Fluxx. You can choose your keepers and change the goal accordingly, but the randomness of the rules changing will often make strategy not pay off. Throw in the dice and it becomes even more unlikely your strategy will pay off. So why play at all if it is just random? Some of us like random (e.g. solitaire is mostly over when the cards are initially dealt) and just want a way to interact and relax. These dice don't seem to work for strategy fans.Newer/younger players are already confused by the rules changing and the game dynamics (rules apply instantaneously...!) and adding this element just makes it seem even more chaotic.It's nice to have, a bit pricy for what it is, but not for everyone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RWX1BKAHOIGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NL056O#wasThisHelpful","R2RWX1BKAHOIGM","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are the logistical issues of getting the in the right orientation in the printer and then folding on the laminate cover. Also (and this may sound petty) you have to do 10 at once. So you can't just go from bin to bin as you would with a label maker; you have to have 10 set to go. And if you make a mistake, you can't just redo one. But they look great and work very well.The good:- Excellent looking results- Printing labels allows variety of text, images, etc.- Appear durableThe not so good:- Expensive, about 40 cents a label- You have to do 10 labels at once (5 sheets of 10 labels).

Perhaps with a bit more time and patience we can get the plane to fly. The air car and other items work better.This kit has thin square wooden sticks, plastic connectors, and specialized parts that are assembled into a variety of propeller driven racers.

There are four mode buttons, but really only two modes. Both Flash and Strobe go from one color to the next abruptly. One setting is just slightly faster than the other. Both Fade and Smooth transition smoothly from one color to the next, just at slightly different speeds.If you turn the bulb on and off with the wall/lamp switch, it comes on in strobe mode, which is frustrating. I wish it remembered its last mode so I wouldn't have to look for the remote. I suppose they want you to leave the wall/lamp switch ON and just use the remote for on/off, which is what we are doing. But sometimes we forget.The metal around the bulb is a little sharp. No cuts yet but it feels like it could cut if grabbed strongly. It isn't great for a table lamp.The light is primarily directed upward but it works OK with a shade to diffuse it more broadly.It is a fun and inexpensive party light.Disclosure: A free sample was provide in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZZI2PYVDDUVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HW49P4#wasThisHelpful","R2ZZI2PYVDDUVP","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent water bottle for those of us who appreciate glass containers (no BPA, no scratches/bacteria growth, etc.) Of course the lid is plastic, so there is still a bit of plastic to deal with. The bottom and sides are also plastic barriers for protecting the bottle but they do not come in contact with the bottle contents.It doesn't leak and the lid is heal securely in place.Why is it four stars?:There is a gap between the plastic outside barrier and the glass bottle inside, so it hold less than other bottles of its size. Just under two cups by our measure. This gap is to protect the glass, but it feels bigger than needed and maybe could be smaller if the plastic was a little thicker.It is a bit hard to clean. You can put it in the dishwasher but you have to take it apart. They recommend removing the silicon seals, which isn't trivial. They are in recesses of the plastic, so you need to pry them out and I worry about cutting them. One seal is near the top between the bottle and the outer shell and is a bit hard to take off too. Once you have it apart, the lid, bottom, outer shell, and glass can go in the dishwasher (we used the top rack). The glass is thin so doesn't fill well in our rack. We have to support it with plastic cups and containers or else it falls over. As a result we just rinse it out by hand every day and dishwash just once in a while. I don't know if that defeats the purpose of having glass in the first place.A minor issue is that cap has a little slide to lock the cap closed and it isn't clear what position it should be in to unlock it. The lid is a bit stiff so you aren't sure. If you look closely there is a lock and an unlocked lock on the switch. If you see the locked lock, it means it is unlocked (so slide it over the locked lock to lock it) and visa versa.Disclosure: I received this as a free sample in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5WI3MX2RJMW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDTM1J2#wasThisHelpful","R5WI3MX2RJMW3","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are the headphones I wear all the time now for listening to podcasts, movies, and music while doing chores. These aren't great for serious music listening, but their benefits far outweigh any downsides.The good:- They sound very good. Not audiophile quality, but good mid-tones and voice. Not particularly strong in bass or vivid treble.- Works very well with my Windows Phone and my iPad. The volume controls, next/previous tract, and pause work great. Holding the Vtin button in for a longer time activates Cortana and/or Siri so I can issue voice commands. Incoming texts are read to me via Cortana and calls are received and managed as expected.- Paired quickly and easily.- Last a long time, at least four hours. I've yet to run them down.- I'm not sure if these have active noise canceling, but these are very good at excluding outside noise. When chopping wood they serve as very good ear protection.- They fit snuggly in my ears and won't come out when the ear hooks are put in properly.The bad:- These can hurt when not adjusted properly. The ear hooks have to be in a very specific orientation for me to not hurt. It took a while to find the right spot. I put the ear hooks in the right place and held them tightly while I rotated the headphone so it slipped relative to the earhooks until it was in the correct place.- I am using the smallest ear hook even though I am an average sized man. I am OK with them but I think a small-eared person might have a hard time making these fit well. I did use them without the ear hooks and they still work well, just not as snug.- The cord is a bit stiff and if you tap it or rub it, some of that noise goes into the headphones.- The USB jack cover is a bit hard to get off.Just FYI:- The volume up/down buttons are also used for prior/next track. This takes some getting used to as you have to hold the button down and wait for a short silence before letting go. You get used to it, but might still change the volume accidently.- The Vtin button serves pentuple duty: headphones on, headphones off, start/stop, pairing, and instigating Cortana/Siri.+ Pairing is only occasional, but if you start from off and hold the button down (it will say power on, but keep holding)  it will pair. You can't just hold it down when they are on, you have to start with it off.+ To turn on, let go when it says power on.+ To turn off, hold it down for a long time until it says off.+ To start Cortana/Siri, you hold it down while on but let go before it goes off. How long is that? Until you hear the beep. Let go right away or you'll turn them off.+ Start/stop is a quick press.These headphones were provided to me for free in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQMFG01K5M38V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111J096I#wasThisHelpful","RQMFG01K5M38V","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used these for a few weeks now and find them to be very good strainers. They've been through the dishwasher several times but no rust yet (although dishwashers are a bad idea since strainers tend to catch food going through it, so only as a last resort.) So a very good deal.I almost picked 4 stars because they aren't luxurious. The handles are open on the bottom (a slot running along the middle, saving material and allowing the plastic to cool appropriately during manufacturing I presume), so not the most ""comfortable"", but they aren't uncomfortable. Just an indication they aren't top of the line.

"Works like a charm!I had two WD 1TB black drives lying around and this was a good deal. The WD drives were on the compatibility list so I bought the unit and set it up. Within an hour it was up and running on my network without problems. I am just using it for NAS so no cloud or stuff, although the DLNA seems to just work. I copied our pictures and movies to the appropriate shares and they are indexed and available via any DLNA device (such as a TV or a phone with the right app.)It wasn't terribly clear which software to download and how to run it. The program is a tiny shell that hooks into a browser-based control system. I just open the app, click on the settings, sign in with my admin password and do everything via the web interface. I don't really see much value to the program itself.If you know a bit about computers and shares, you'll manage just fine. If this is alien to you, it might take some time. It was easy but not plug-and-play or leading you by the hand.I set up a share for a family member and gave them their own read/write password. Set up file history on their windows 8.1 PC to point to that share (using the share id/password which is different than their logon) and its been working great. Every time I've check they've been fully backed up.I am a big windows fan but find it frustrating when dealing with network drives when they ask for credentials. They assume you are on a domain with the name of you pc (you'll see that near the bottom of the sign-in box.) Instead of signing in with username and password (which is interpreted as thisPC/username and password) you have to type //IX2-2/username and password (or maybe one slash at the beginning?) so it know to verify it on the NAS and not your PC.I intend to by a UPS for it so that it will spin down gracefully in the event of a power failure. I am using it in a mirrored RAID configuration but no files exist only on the NAS.

"I had these refrigerated for flavor (they don't have to be) but smoothies are typically cold in my house. Twist the top off and there is a small (3/8""?) hole through which you enjoy the smoothie. It turns out well to suck and squeeze the container and you get almost all of the smoothie out easily with no mess or fuss.This is strawberry-banana, which is a common flavor for our household (we have kids). But it tasted a bit too ""enhanced"", perhaps from the added sugar and whey protein isolate.  Also there was a texture to it that was unexpected; I am thinking that is from the added soluble fiber.Overall I thought these were fine but not something I look forward to having.

"These were very good. I liked them because of their crunchy peanut butter flavor. It reminded me of peanut butter cereal (Captain Crunch or Bumpers), although a bit more oily. It was the oily coating that felt a bit odd, a little like the white coating on some inexpensive white coated pretzels. Regardless of how healthy they actually are, the oily texture and sweet taste made me feel there were likely more healthy alternative. I enjoy them but perhaps once in a while.

"Four stars because ""I like it"". The pasta was very good tasting and had a good texture. Close enough to regular Barilla that it's not worth trying to discern a difference.I followed the directions (3/4 cup water in saucepan for 10 minutes) and the pasta was done in about 8 minutes when there was still water left. So I drained it in a colander as I do with regular pasta an it was fine. This obviated any advantage this provides as far as cleanup. It also made me think the second step of cooking it with added sauce would have made it too soft. You add salt while cooking but they give no idea how much. I add salt to water boiled for pasta, but since most is drained away, I can just guess the amount. For this it all stays with the pasta so you have to get it right. So you'll have to make this a few times to learn the amount of water, the time, and the amount of salt that works best. It was a bit faster to cook (still about 10 minutes, but you don't have to wait for a larger pot of water to boil first.)This was fine and perhaps a good plus for those in a hurry and trying to make one-pan meals (mine was chicken and Tuscan spices with olive oil). However boiling regular pasta may be cheaper (I'm not taking into account to cost of boiling six or eight cups of water instead of 3) and feels less finicky. This 12 oz box isn't enough for my family of 4 and 2 boxes would be too much.Very good pasta and likely worth getting to learn to make if time and convenience is your priority.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17S1IEMJJR39Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7NA4XU#wasThisHelpful","R17S1IEMJJR39Z","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We normally use Finish Powerball Tabs Dishwasher Detergent Tablets and decided to try these to see if they were worth the extra money. We didn't notice any obvious difference in our plates and glass during normal use. Maybe there was some slight improvement upon closer inspection, but nothing that we'd pay extra for.Over the Powerball Tabs we use, these Quantum Max Powerballs claim they prevent redeposits, protect glass, and increase shine/sparkle. We use ceramic plates, clear glasses (but not wine glasses), and stainless tableware and we didn't notice a difference. Perhaps if we had wine glasses it would be more important. We are a bit wary about how they increase sparkle and shine; are they leaving something on our glasses/plates?We did appreciate that this is packaged very compactly, saving space under the sink. Also the tabs are completely dissolvable. The Powerball Tabs we normally use are wrapped in mylar we have to tear open. The tablets inside feel a bit drying on the hand so they aren't pleasant to handle.

"I was given this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review. There was no payment or expectation that the review would have a certain rating.My car only has Bluetooth for the phone, which uses the car's directory system and such, which is inferior to using my phone directly. Additionally my car didn't support audio, which prevented me from listening podcasts from the phone. I purchased a  Kinivo BTC450 Bluetooth Hands-Free Car Kit for Cars with Aux Input Jack (3.5 mm). It worked great that I was going to order another for my wife's car, but lucked into this review model. It works just as well, with small differences here and there.I plugged the USB adapter into my power port (aka cigarette lighter outlet), the headphone-type plug into my Radio's Aux jack, and turned on the radio to Aux. Pressing an holding the button initiated the pairing which went very well. After that my phone pairs automatically when I turn on the car. A press of the button/knob starts my podcasts where I left off. Turn the knob clockwise and it advanced by 30 seconds, counter clockwise and it goes back 10 seconds. Press the button to pause, press again to resume. Press and hold to engage Cortana via voice, which allows me to make phone calls, start music, send texts, and do other things hands free. When I receive a call I press the big button to answer and again to hang up. It is very simple and effective and just simply works. With music turning the knob goes to the next song or to the beginning of the current one or back one song.This works virtually identically to the Kinivo with the following features I noticed:Compared to the Kinivo:- power is through a USB plug, so any USB adapter will work. You could even use this in your home office by plugging it into a USB adaptor and the audio through some computer speakers. The Kinivo is terminated with a car power plug, so it is car only.Rotating the knob back and forth is easy and intuitive. The Kinivo has small buttons which are a little hard to press (but fine, so not really an issue.)The Parateck audio jack comes straight out, like a headphone jack. If your Aux jack is on your radio face, the cable will stick out a about an inch. The Kinivo is right-angled, so it keeps it neater when plugging directly into the radio, sticking out only a quarter inch or so.The USB adapter is separate on the Parateck and one is provided, but it is long and sticks out the port by about an inch. Then the USB plug sticks out a little in addition to this. This may or may not be an issue depending on your port location. The Parateck takes one of the two ports, leaving one free for phone charging. The Kinivo power plug is more compact and, with no USB to plug in, is overall much less prominent. It has a free USB port as well. You could always use your own USB adaptor.The Parateck is black, slightly smaller in diameter, but somewhat thicker so it is easier to grip. It has a little chrome accent so is a bit more visible than the matt gray Kinivo. The Kinivo is almost invisible on my gray dash (which I like.)My wife says my voice sounds slightly more tinny when using the Parateck.To mount the parateck you mount a small plate to your dash with double-sided tape. The Parateck then attaches to that magnetically. This makes it easily removable. The Kinivo mounts directly with double sided tape which meant I had to rip it off when I used it in my rental car, then clean up the tape residue, and reinstall when I got home. If you are going to move the device around, the Parateck might be a better deal. I don't know if they sell extra plates; that would be a nice plus.They both work great so your choice may be a matter of what feature set works for you. The Parateck is likely more friendly for those of us with ""fat fingers"" and don't have an issue with the aux and power jacks sticking out (perhaps it in the glove box or on the console.) The Kinivo is lower profile for the device, jack, and power, so nicer if you want it to disappear more (you still have the wires.) Having a slightly better microphone is a plus too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHG8F8FVSL1RT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7HG39O#wasThisHelpful","RHG8F8FVSL1RT","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used to use witch hazel from the discount drug store all the time for a refreshing feel and astringency. When I was offered this I thought it might be nice to see what a top-notch version felt like. It does feel very good but I can't say that it is so much better than the other, less expensive, brands that it is worth the extra price. The rose water is fairly strong too, for good or for bad; you'll be smelling roses for a while after you put it on.This is a fairly expensive bottle for a fairly high price. That means you dab it on with a cotton swab. Part of what was refreshing about the conventional brands is that they are inexpensive enough to use liberally and even it use it on legs/backs/arms without worrying cost.I like it (definition of 4 stars) but I don't love it because I have to be careful with the amount I use and because I smell roses too long after application.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WDBHSUNBA5U5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB85VV2#wasThisHelpful","R2WDBHSUNBA5U5","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this thick book (277 pages) you'll find hundreds of times when you are struck by Truth.  I didn't find it a book intended to be read quickly - there isn't a plot you want to get to the end of - but I did underline several passages on nearly every page that are worthy of deeper pondering.  This is a book meant to be studied and reflected upon.  I am not from a military lifestyle but I found the wisdom in these pages universal.  Greitens is well-educated in the great philosophers and writers of long ago and he pulls from their eternal wisdom in his advice for cultivating resilience.The only possible negative is that the writing is disjointed.  As this is a collection of letters the author wrote to a friend in need, subjects jump around and get repeated.  In truth I think this preserves the rawness of the writing and so I prefer it this way.  Each paragraph or two can be read separately and used as a subject to think about during the course of the day.I strongly recommend this book to everyone who is interested in examining their life to make it richer and more meaningful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22QD39HSK3OYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054432398X#wasThisHelpful","R22QD39HSK3OYP","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

All is well as you see in the last drawing that the cousin is  building a 'New World house' next to William's.Side images in pen and ink show sweet images of William's two children as they are exploring their new environment.My sons are 9yo and while this book is probably written for children younger, it still has value for them as we discussed the changes William made  to his house and why.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PPK7AMSO3CJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761316744#wasThisHelpful","R1PPK7AMSO3CJ6","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The beauty of this book is in its woodblock illustrations, which are represented as carvings done by the boy whose journal we are reading in the text.  The story follows a year or so in the life of an indentured servant (based on a real child named Christopher Sears) whose ship was originally headed to Jamestown but was wrecked and the passengers were taken to Plimouth instead where they had to earn their keep.  When a year has passed and a ship is available to take the Sparrowhawk's passengers to Jamestown, Christopher wants to remain in Plimouth.  The question is, will he be allowed?  I read it in two evenings as a bedtime story to my 9yo sons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H8V34T6PO316/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0064407195#wasThisHelpful","R3H8V34T6PO316","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 8- and 9-year old sons and I really enjoyed this biography of William Bradford.  I highly recommend it.  There are 14 chapters and we read two to three each night at bedtime.  This book tells of William's tumultuous childhood, the struggles he went through to get an education and to go to the church of his choice, and his meeting and connection to the Brewsters which ultimately lead him to America.  The last three chapters explain the trials to get to Holland, travel on the Mayflower and ends around the time of the 'first Thanksgiving'. Though I read the book aloud to my sons, I would say the book is simple enough for a 3rd grader to read to himself.  William suffered many losses in his life but the hardship seemed to strengthened William's character made him the great, compassionate leader he became.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J02QIV9YNP6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007E6NTQ#wasThisHelpful","R2J02QIV9YNP6L","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I installed this on my Nissan Leaf and installation was as easy as with any wiper; just slide it on the ""U"" at the end of the wiper arm until it clicks. It hugs the windshield well and does a nice clean wipe of the wet windshield, as would be expected for new blades, and they seem to behave well at my commuting speeds (about 45-65 MPH.)The look very much like the same design as those that came with my Leaf in that they have a segmented backbone design. The cheaper blades come without a cover and you can see the metal and wire bits pretty clearly. The segmented blade design on those does a decent job of spreading the pressure out evenly on the wiper blade so it is in better contact with the window. I believe the cover on the ""better"" blades provide aerodynamic stability at speed and keeps out leaves, ice, and other debris. The covered blades I've used in the past (Michelin, I believe) had a one-piece backbone that provided the springiness and protection. Sometimes these could be too stiff, meaning that on a relatively flat portion of the windshield there would be more pressure on the ends than in the middle and you could get streaking in the middle of the blade.These blades are a combination of both. The backbone does not provide very much springiness to the wiper. That is done with the softer metal inside. The outer part is in four pieces that are hinged together but without and springiness. So it works well on the windshield while also offering the aerodynamics and protection.I've only had these on for a short time but my expectation on blades is that they last about a year (I replace them prior to my annual inspection and am disappointed if I have to replace sooner). If these perform any differently I will update this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TI4GV7ID2IZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWNZ53A#wasThisHelpful","R2TI4GV7ID2IZL","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got this product simply for enjoyment; no one in the family has medical issues we were intending to address.  Imagine my surprise when I found that it truly seemed to help my plantar fasciitis.  I had recently been told the pain I was having in my foot following a two-hour jump at a trampoline house with my children was plantar fasciitis and was trying to remedy it with stretches, rolling and an insert for my shoes.  It was slowly improving but still bothered me.  Amazingly I have had almost no pain in my foot following my first 30 minute session with this machine.  Maybe it was coincidence but I'm crediting this machine!The level goes from 0 to 99.  Using the remote you increase one level at a time.  I don't feel anything until I set it to ~15.  From there to ~level 30 it feels tickly, sort of 'pins and needles' or like something is crawling on your foot.  Not sensations many folks try to recreate.  After level 30 you get the full muscle contraction coordination I think the machine is intended for.  The session has a varying schedule in which each minute has a different rhythm and intensity.  I like the change in sensations this creates.  I have had 30 minute sessions using level 44.  At this level it feels very different, though for me it is still pleasant.  The muscle contraction causes my big toe or foot to move uncontrollably (my toe raises and my foot points) during the higher intensity parts of the session and that feels really interesting.For this review I have just tried increasing the level to 60 and that's an entirely different experience - probably what I'm supposed to be doing all along, actually.  The machine definitely controls my muscles at this point and I wonder if my calves will feel sore or anything tomorrow.  It is not painful in the least right now; quite the contrary, it feels so interesting!  I think I'm going to do level 60 session from now on!I have not used the pads for other parts of my body nor have I used the 'Step' part of the machine (in fact I can't figure out what it is for or why someone would choose to do it).Two things I really don't like: the beep that accompanies each level increase with the remote and the fact that there isn't a pause button for when I get interrupted during a session.  It isn't hard to start over but I do have to listen to that annoying beep for each level I pass to start over.(And just as a side note, I sometimes do it wearing socks and it feels the same as barefoot.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MZ7HHMPUZTZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2X4BQW#wasThisHelpful","R3MZ7HHMPUZTZW","ALRCAGJOJ9583","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRCAGJOJ9583?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are jeans.  They are a nice dark black so you can wear them in professional situations, I wore them with a polo and they looked good.  However, they don't replace a pair of black slacks for more formal business attire.  They are clearly jeans even if they are nice jeans.The fabric is a mostly polyester blend with some cotton.  It looks like normal denim but has a lot more stretch.  I wore these straight from work to rock climbing without changing.  I have done a ton of walking in a short time and think they are more comfortable for walking than typical jeans.  They don't have a gusseted crotch but are a bit thinner than normal cotton denim and have a lot more stretch, so you can totally move around however you need, they won't restrict you.The fit is slim fit.  They aren't skinny jeans, but they aren't loose either.  If you have thick legs you will likely find these too tight.  For me they were a perfect fit, they didn't have a lot of loose material but weren't clinging to me either.  They fit and size about like a Levi 514 if you have tried those jeans.As with most black keep in mind these will show dust (though they dusted off with a hand better than normal denim jeans) and you will get hot in the sun as they soak up those rays.Overall, I'm really happy with these, they have earned a spot in my closet and in my life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RT8GDTXNNAVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYN5J2U#wasThisHelpful","R1RT8GDTXNNAVE","A2RLLC0EGSXPPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RLLC0EGSXPPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a lot of water filters out there, this one is best for an extended base camp or a large group backpacking.  The two things that set it apart from other water filters are it's lifetime of 18,000 liters and that it filters out viruses without the use of chemicals.  Filtering out viruses is probably not needed for backcountry wilderness purposes, but is a really good idea if your water is coming from somewhere in or downstream of populated areas.It is a little big for most backpacking trips where the extended life and virus filtering aren't needed.  For that use case consider the Platypus or MSR (same filter), Katadyn, or the Sawyer.  All of those are smaller/lighter and also use a hollow filber filter but don't filter out viruses.

"The screen is the same size and resolution and ratio as the iPad Mini 3.  It looks as good.  The thickness is the same.  Both the ipad mini 3 and the Asus ZenPad S come with similar configurations of ram and storage.  The intel proccessor in the Asus is quite fast, and the ipad isn't a slouch itself.  On specs alone it is a virtual tie.The choice between them will come down to price, service, and preference.  The Asus ZenPad S is cheaper, so that's a clear win.  Apple service is hard to beat.  iOS vs Android will be debated forever, personally I prefer Android but if you prefer iOS the iPad comes with that.Overall I'd take this Asus ZenPad S over the iPad mini 3.

"When a leading consumer magazine (you know the one) did a sunscreen test all of their recommended sunscreens contained all 5 of the active ingredients Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, Octocrylene, and Oxybenzone and no other active ingredients.  Unfortunately they didn't test any stick sunscreens, but guess what the active ingredients list looks like for this stick:Avobenzone (3%), Homosalate (15%), Octisalate (5%), Octocrylene (10%), and Oxybenzone (3%)Based on that ingredient list in those concentrations there is an almost certain chance that this sunscreen would test well.  I also know that living in the hot sweaty south the stick style sunscreens tend to apply easier and in my experience last longer.If you are looking for a spray sunscreen that you don't have to rub in that also has these active ingredients, in fact it has the same proportions as this stick other than it also has more Oxybenzone, look at the Marathon Mist SPF50 6oz  I tend to use that spray for full body coverage and apply a stick to my face.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AA642SL7OYHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPBL1LM#wasThisHelpful","R1AA642SL7OYHI","A2RLLC0EGSXPPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RLLC0EGSXPPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the 3 port hub with gigabit ethernet (HT-UE01).  I bought it so I'd have a wired ethernet option for my Macbook.  The Macbook didn't recognize the ethernet port out of the box, but after installing the drivers from the HooToo website the ethernet works very well.  For me the 3 port USB hub is just a throw in bonus.  As such the hub seems to work out of the box as well as any USB hub, namely most devices work fine and a few devices just really like to be plugged in directly and not go through a hub.Inside the Ethernet is driven by an ASIX AX88179 chip.  The manufacturer of that chip seems to have good driver support for Mac, Linux, and Windows.  You can see the same ethernet chip in the newer rounded Anker USB 3.0 to RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, but that model is more expensive than this one and doesn't include a 3 port hub.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SCGXK90SKGUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CKIFPQY#wasThisHelpful","R3SCGXK90SKGUK","A2RLLC0EGSXPPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RLLC0EGSXPPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Cree-XML is a bright and efficient LED.  The T-6 was a high binning version of that.  Now the XML-2 is out and about 20% brighter, but the original is still pretty sweet.  Putting it in a waterproof focusing flashlight and including a 26650 battery and charger make this a real value.  I like the flashlight a lot.  Compact, bright, focusing, etc.The focusing mechanism works very well once you zoom out just a bit.  All the way zoomed in it actually projects an image of the LED.  Just slightly wider it makes a nice square spot and as you go out the wider flood becomes more round.  The light is very even through 95% of the range.The 26650 works great and will give long lifetime.  The plastic sleeve allows you to use it with the narrower 186650 batteries if you already have some.  The included 3 AAA holder works, but is slightly narrower so it doesn't fit snugly, the flashlight is also slightly less bright with the AAA batteries and will last a lot less time.  Still, having the AAA as an option is good when traveling.It would be nice if the flashlight had a lower low setting for things like reading a book at night in a tent.  But overall it's hard to complain about a flashlight being too bright.I was provided this flashlight in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R352IM2MCMCXAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z8X3BL4#wasThisHelpful","R352IM2MCMCXAW","A2RLLC0EGSXPPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RLLC0EGSXPPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A leading Consumer Magazine (you know the one) rated the Anco31 as their third best wiper blade and rated it a best buy.  The Valeo 600 came in first and Rain-X Latitude came in second, but both are much more expensive.The Bosch SteelTech seem to do a good job wiping away water.  In my informal testing out of the box the performance of the Bosch SteelTech is comparable in rain vs the Anco 31.  This makes them a good buy.  However, at the time of this writing the Anco are cheaper on Amazon.  Also, the leading consumer magazine does more exhaustive testing than I do and they haven't tested the Bosch SteelTech yet, meanwhile the Anco 31 are a proven product.In summary buy these if you want, they are fine, but buying the Anco 31 is the smarter move as they are cheaper and well tested.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M69HZCESZBNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJK9O3C#wasThisHelpful","R2M69HZCESZBNX","A2RLLC0EGSXPPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RLLC0EGSXPPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was pleased with this product overall.  It is a good waterproof bluetooth speaker.Pros:* Waterproof* Nice controls* Decent sound* Pairs well* Charges with standard micro-usb plug* Kickstand is handyCons:* At maximum volume there is noticeable distortion.  Turning the volume down a notch or two produces clear sound.* The volume is adequate. At this price and size it's hard to complain about the volume, it's fine for the shower or a smaller room, but if you had a larger pool, a party full of people, or a lot of background music it might not be loud enough.* The bass is adequate.  At this price and size it is really hard to complain, but if you need a lot of punchy bass something this size really just doesn't give that thump","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R291LPSZG68DJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOVP614#wasThisHelpful","R291LPSZG68DJK","A2RLLC0EGSXPPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RLLC0EGSXPPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The best source of protein you can choose, as far as having a good balance of all the essential amino acids and lack of toxins is going to be lean meat or seafood.  Chicken Breast, Sirloin Steak, Sockeye Salmon.  Those are examples of real food you should consider eating before relying on protein powder.  That said, smoothies can be quick and convenient and often a good way to get your fruit and vegetable intake.  When you make smoothie it is often nice for it to have a source of protein and protein powder fits that bill very nicely.Whey protein isolate is the best protein powder you can choose.  Heres why:Whey protein isolate vs concentrate.  Concentrate is cheaper.  Isolate removes the milk fats and carbohydrates and leave almost pure protein.  It is important to remove the fats not because all fats are bad for you, but because some types of fats probably are bad for you.  Milk fat contains approximately 65% saturated, 30% monounsaturated, and 5% polyunsaturated fatty acids.  Those 65% saturated fats are the ones most scientists believe are unhealthy.  Also the carbohydrates in milk include lactose, which a very large number of people have trouble digesting.  Because whey protein isolate doesnt have the saturated fats and lactose of whey protein concentrate most scientists consider it to be healthier for you.Soy protein isolate is another alternative.  Soy is considered a complete protein in that it contains all the essential amino acids.  The main downside to Soy protein isolate is that it has a concentration of Saponins of 10.6 g/kg.  The full health effects of Saponins are still being studied, but several peer reviewed articles have shown Saponins to increase intestinal permeability also known as leaky gut. Leaky gut can cause low levels of inflammation throughout the body and other short term and long term negative health effects.In summary, Whey Protein Isolate isnt quite as good as eating foods naturally high in protein, but it can make a healthy smoothie even healthier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22LXK237DSORX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OWAB4#wasThisHelpful","R22LXK237DSORX","A2RLLC0EGSXPPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RLLC0EGSXPPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like the heart shape and the crystals. The black crystals seem a bit more grey then black, but the understated nature of not having color is nice sometimes.  All around it is nice enough. I used it as a stocking stuffer and it was very good for that.  I think it would also be a nice impulse gift for a daughter.  I sometimes like to use gifts like this to be a physical reminder of a pleasant time, say giving it to your daughter on the way to a concert you are taking her to.However, be aware that like most jewelry at this price it is small. 18"" is shorter than most men like me realize, it doesn't hang down very far. The chain is thin and the piece itself is relatively insignificant in size. If you are planning to buy it for your girlfriend as a gift for an occasion like Valentines day, a birthday, or Christmas you may come up short of the desired effect and have to open your wallet a little wider.  However, if you are just buying it as a surprise no occasion gift it will probably go over better than flowers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32SXS0HWLIYLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCAU7T8#wasThisHelpful","R32SXS0HWLIYLK","A2RLLC0EGSXPPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RLLC0EGSXPPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fast charging.  I hooked this up to the USB power meter and it put out 0.867A and 0.977A in each of the two ports charging a 1A device.  That's really impressive and is faster than almost any wall charger I've tested.  I also like the grippy rubbery case and the almost universal blue leds to indicate battery charge.So, why not 5 stars?  First, the packaging says ""Pre Charged & Ready To Go"" which just isn't true.  My unit came almost completely discharged (single blue dot on the battery indicator) and needed to be charged for quite awhile before it was used.  Second, the flashlight while really just a throw in isn't very bright.  But mostly at the time of this review you can buy similar quality and capacity chargers for a lot less money.  I think this is a fine unit that will serve you well, but so are some others that you can pick up a lot cheaper.In the interest of full disclosure I received this unit in exchange for a fair review.

"I recently read Alice Hoffman's book of the same name which I thoroughly enjoyed and gave a 5 star rating to. Honestly, when I read the book I was not even aware that a television mini- series had been made of the book so I was eager to see how well the show followed the book. I had been ignorant about the story of Masada and have been inspired to read some non-fiction now.I have to say that I was surprised at some of the changes they made in the show ...some of them did make sense. I was pleased at how the series provided me some visuals of what the area may have looked like....the dust (which I feel may be quite accurate), and ditto to the water cisterns and the clothing.

"First off I should mention that:1: I purchased this solely for use as a seam gauge- not for the foot that comes with it.2: I purchased it in ""used-good condition"".I have recently returned to apparel sewing after sewing only quilts for many, many years. I did not need this to mark a quarter inch seam since my foot does a perfect job of that and I am skilled at eyeballing a quarter inch. I am not as good at knowing 1/2"" and 5/8"" seams though and I wanted to use this marker for that purpose. I did not want to use a magnetic marker since I fear even a bit of an issue with my beloved computerized Janome machine. I also wanted/needed a marker that is movable.The marker arrived in original packaging..but showed use on the ""renewable"" and ""moveable"" sticky backs. The material used to attach this  seam gauge to your machine bed is not like double stick tape - it is more like the rubbery thick tape that can be used to hang posters on walls without damage....you may know the blue tacky stuff I mean (called Elmer's Poster Tack) . I just ran hot water over the residue that was stuck to the tape and it adhered just fine to the base of my Janome machine and to my clear acrylic desk top. No problems with this....though I wish that there was a better solution.The seam measure itself is between 1/8"" and 1/4"" thick... Thinner over areas where the tacky stuff is and thicker over the non tape areas. In that regard it does provide a solid, stable surface to run material against. The material that the gauge is made from is not flexible- it's just plastic ...maybe a little more soft than regular plastic though...which is actually a decent attribute. It does have a bendable forward edge that can go along the front side of your machine if it is not set in a cabinet or flat surface. I just used mine flat and it looks just fine- perfect, straight line.I could have used a stack of post it notes I suppose but this looked like a better alternative and in fact, after trying so many different ""measure gadgets"", I think that this may be the best current alternative available.If I had a seam gauge wish list it would include a strip of about 1/8"" thickness that was long enough to go the length of the  machine and part of my table (or as long as I wanted it to be), it would be flexible enough to feel nice and still do the job and it would be eminently, easily,  'reposition-able'. Until I find a better ""mousetrap"" this will suit well enough. I do wish that it was available without the foot though...that will go unused and un-needed. I think that is a bit expensive for what it is...but buying used here on Amazon made the cost just a bit more palatable.It's the best thing that I have tried and it will be a help, but it could be much better IMHO.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GB0DZAOZZQ95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOTBNYA#wasThisHelpful","R3GB0DZAOZZQ95","A2JNO9OR8FGNR4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNO9OR8FGNR4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I begin I mess to confess that I was offered this sketchbook at a reduced price for my review.It is hackneyed phrase that ""this is my honest review"" but since I am an inveterate 'journaler' and art dabbler I do think that my review is based on many years of ""paper experience"".  I am fond of using Stillman and Birn sketchbooks, and Quo Vadis, Rhoda and Moleskein journals, but I  am always on the lookout for good quality sketchbooks and journals since Imuse a lot of them!  My primary concerns when using a sketchbook or journal is how much ""bleed-through"" I experience when using inks and mediums. The beautiful, creamy colored 60# paper in this Leda Sketchbook has a very smooth, superior, texture. It's a perfect surface for writing on as well for just about any sort of pen, pencil, ink or light color wash you may want to use on it's pages. I tried using a wash of watercolor and had excellent results. Fountain pen ink has very minimal bleed through as do Sharpies and gel ink pens. My Sharpie Pens (fine tip) showed NO bleed through at all!The attached images show the journal, it's nice gray page marker and sturdy elastic strap. I am particularly fond of the cover material used on this sketchbook...it has a wonderful, almost slightly rubberized, texture that ensure a good hold. The book itself opens flatly for ease-of-use. The pages DO NOT have the slightly wavy appearance that my camera seems to have captured...the color is perfect, the pages very smooth but a slight bit of tooth to ensure excellent acceptance of  your chosen media. The surface provides a pleasurable experience to work on. I would not suggest this sketchbook for heavy wet mediums or textured substrates , but for pens, pencils, inks, light washes and most anything else it is a great choice at a good price point too. It works well for my one and ink practice calligraphy.For me, this is a 'local' company too and since I like to patronize ""in-state"" suppliers if I can this is an extra good thing for me personally. The contacts that I had with the company were all very quick and very cordial- so I think that their customer service must be superior.So there you have it....my sincere remarks about an excellent choice in sketchbooks!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LF65IPS86ESC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YVS969S#wasThisHelpful","R1LF65IPS86ESC","A2JNO9OR8FGNR4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNO9OR8FGNR4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to admit to being quite ignorant of India's history, and I chose this book from our library without high expectations, although I have enjoyed other books by Michelle Moran in the past. I think that this is one of her best works yet! The story of of the protagonist, Sita Bhopal (one of the rani's extremely skilled female guards), and the Rani is riveting. Unexpectedly, I was hooked from the first page of the Prologue. The plot moves along very well throughout the book and the characters are beautifully defined.A side benefit was learning a bit about the history of this Indian State and the English takeover. I learned about Hindu gods and goddesses as well which was very enjoyable. As always, after I finish a great historical novel I always read more of the facts, and I found that this book adheres well to established history. Now I would like to read more about India and it's history and religion...something that had previously not been high on my personal ""to do"" list. Yep!

"i have had a couple of back surgeries, and when I over do something- especially outdoor chores, I feel it a lot. Today I tried these in place of an adhesive, menthol derivative patch that I had been using. They do produce a pleasant warm effect, of a quality about like the lower settings on a heating pad. I am not fond of the papery band which is used to wrap and attach these patches. It is bothering my skin a bit - then again I have quite sensitive skin so most people may not mind this feature as much as I do. I also found that the slight tension on my back from the more adhesive kind of menthol pad felt good just by holding the skin in a bit for some reason. I think that these are quite pricey too unless purchased in bulk. If I feel badly enough to need these I would prefer my chair and heating pad, but, if you are not able to sit like that and you hurt, and you have to keep going, then these are probably a good alternative to not accomplishing anthing!","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRWAIB64CY6ME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G7QUXW#wasThisHelpful","RRWAIB64CY6ME","A2JNO9OR8FGNR4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNO9OR8FGNR4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of my favorite of all of Kaffe Fassett's books. I fell in love with the quilt on the cover and just had to make it, although I did use some other colors for a bit brighter effect.The quilts in this book are a bit more subtle than the usual super vibrant colors in most of the quilts in Kaffe Fassett books. As the title indicates, Kaffee Fassett's line of shot cottons and stripes are the primary 'ingredients' in these quilts. Many of the patterns are based on ""old time"" classics that are ""re-invented"" by using more modern color choices. I find that I need to starch the KF line of shot cottons since they are fairly lightweight and I have also become very fond of Pepper Cory's new line of shot cottons from Studio-E because they have a bit more heft.This book is a keeper for me and, judging from the number of friends who have purchased it after looking through my copy, it holds a wide appeal for both ""Kaffe-a-holics"" and ""regular"" quilters alike!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2343ZHBRZMH5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617690163#wasThisHelpful","R2343ZHBRZMH5O","A2JNO9OR8FGNR4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNO9OR8FGNR4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just cannot decide between 3 and four stars! It should rate 5 stars from me, and I have struggled with what to say about this book.The book covers one of my favorite periods of history and recounts the amazing life of Margaret Beaufort, her loves, marriages and the fall of the house of Lancaster. As far as I can tell from studying the facts, this book was spot on historically.  Henry VI is portrayed much as I imagine he might have been - as is the redoubtable Duke of York and Warwick, the Kingmaker. This should have been one of my favorite reads, but it just missed the mark a bit.The author includes many quotes from historical archives and contemporaneous 15th century journals that are generally, but not always, placed at either the beginning or end of a chapter. Oddly enough, this is the part that I am not sure that I liked. I found that reading the quotes (which you certainly want to do) through off my 'timing' and my feel for the novel.  Although the relevancy of the quotes was excellent I almost wish that all of the ""footnotes to history"" were included in some other way - though exactly how it might have been better presented I have not been able to decide.This book will delight those of us who thrive on British history and it will also be most enjoyable for those who just love a good novel. I am certainly glad that I read it, but I came away from it feeling somehow less than satisfied. Is it worth the read? Resoundingly ""yes!"". Will it be one of you favorites?

"A friend gave me one of these pins to try and then I was unable to locate them because we did not know who made them. I was so happy to finally find them. I like the longer length and slimness of the pin, plus who can resist a button shaped pinhead?! They work very well, comparable to another, more expensive brand.

"I actually bought these to use for my olive oil that I keep in a wine bottle. I currently have an oil spout in the bottle (like the Stainless Steel Classic Bottle Pourers with Tapered Spout), but the way my kitchen is designed, I keep the oil in a place that constantly gets knocked over and I'm always afraid the oil is going to spill out.

"Due to the layout of our rental house, we can't get any cross ventilation so even when it's nice out, it's hard to get the cool air in. We didn't want the hassle or expense of an actual screen door (even the cheapest wooden ones are $50, plus all the necessary accessories like springs and whatnot) so I found this solution instead. And it seemed perfect! We could keep the garage door open which would give us a direct line of ventilation to the back door.Except.We didn't clearly think it through that we'd obviously have to leave our big garage door open as well--which would be fine except for two things:1) Our neighborhood is a bit Stepford in that garage doors are always closed--if a door is open, it's because someone is physically pulling a car in or out, someone is walking through the garage, or someone is working in the yard. Otherwise, they're closed. (We've lived here almost a year now, and I can count on one hand the number of times I've seen garage doors just...open.)2) So, even if we wanted to leave it open, we have A LOT of stuff in our garage that is kinda messy and cluttered. And we probably don't need to worry about theft or anything, but do we want to take that chance? Of course we'd only leave it open if we were home...and there's only a few months a year when we'd want cross ventilation anyway (spring and fall, otherwise it's just too hot or too cold)...but it's still something to think about.Additionally:- We discovered that our cats have no problem exiting through the screen...which is a problem, unfortunately, as they are inside-only cats. So when we do leave the door open, we have to keep a strict eye on them which is annoying. My husband has already had to chase one back in the house after we left it open while he was mowing the lawn.- If you install these near a metal door (like the door to a garage), the flaps are constantly sticking to the door. It's fine if you're just going in and out of the house and closing the door behind you...but when you go in and our and want to leave it open, you have to stop and make sure the flap closes behind you.- While I like the ease of simply installing with velcro and sticky tape...it's a major PITA to remove if you decide you don't want to use it. I'd like to see a version that comes with, maybe, metal tack strips that you just screw in.+ I do like that in the off season, we can just remove the whole thing and store it until we need it again.So it may sound like I don't recommend this item...but I do...if you have the right conditions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GBW8APVI3S5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZNOHTW#wasThisHelpful","R1GBW8APVI3S5R","A14DNCG5WHM86Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DNCG5WHM86Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this as a gift but I had actually gotten a similar versions of this game for a niece (Educational Insights Raccoon Rumpus Game). I have to say I'm glad I waited, as this game is for a bit older set and is a bit more complicated than the racoon version. I am also a fan of another Educational Insights game--The Sneaky, Snacky Squirrel Game.You get 4 Koala cards with 3D koala faces, 20 outfit cards, and 2 jumbo dice (one to pick the outfit piece and one to pick the pattern). I like that the instructions are printed ON the inside lid of the box top. (There's an insert with directions in other languages, but I threw that away.)I really like the small form factor of the box--5.5"" x 8"" x 2.25""--because it's easy to throw in a bag and doesn't take up a lot of shelf space. That said, it could still be smaller yet as there are two big 1.5"" empty cardboard-filled sections that could be eliminated (but would then leave less space for instructions and product design).Outfit die: shirt, shirt, pants, pants, shirt and pants, and underwearPattern die: flowers, stripes, checkered, zig zag, polka dots, and a starThe object of the game is to be the first person to collect five outfits. You lay out all the outfit cards, roll the dice, and the combination you roll tells you what kind of outfit you need to find. You might get a checkered shirt or flowered pants. If you roll the shirt/pants combo, you get to select two outfits instead of one. Rolling a star means you get to pick whatever pattern you want. However, if you roll the underwear, you lose ALL of your outfits. A game can be finished fairly quickly--I think we played three games in about 20 minutes.I was worried that there might not be a big enough selection of cards, whereby maybe you'd roll a polka dot shirt and there wouldn't be any left (due to other previous selections) but we never had that happen in any of our first five games. Yes, it's completely random so it COULD happen, but I was happy that it didn't seem to happen with any frequency (or, in our case, at all).The recommended ages for this game are 3+. I wasn't sure how well my almost-3yo would do, but she actually understood it pretty well and was able to pick out the matching outfits. Her biggest problem is that the dice are really big so she has to roll each one separately! It's bordering on being too young for my 6yo, but he enjoyed playing it just the same (as did I).The ""bonus memory game"" included is just separate instructions for another game to play with the same cards: place all cards face down in a memory-style format then use the pattern die to determine what outfit you need to find. If you flip an outfit card and it matches, you get the card. If not, the next person rolls a new pattern and picks a new piece. So, memory, but with the twist of needing to remember separate patterns of shirts and pants and matching them to currently rolled die.So, how can I give the game a five-star rating when all the sub-categories are four stars? Well, for the price and small form factor, it gets bumped up! I'd definitely recommend this game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTWCGQ1UVGM2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SLWJCHG#wasThisHelpful","RTWCGQ1UVGM2E","A14DNCG5WHM86Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DNCG5WHM86Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HAIR BACKGROUNDI have very thick wavy hair to the middle of my back. I typically only wash my hair once a week (maybe twice in the summer if I've really been sweating) and usually just rinse it thoroughly. I fully blow-dry and straighten it maybe once or twice a month. It hasn't been cut in in over a year (I don't get it cut very often anyway, plus we've moved and I hate finding a new stylist) so the ends are in pretty sad shape. If I don't put product in my hair, it tends to get quite flyaway as it dries.THOUGHTS ON PRODUCT- The directions are only printed on the outside packaging--AND in very small print. I read them, thought I'd remember them because they were pretty easy, but a week later I couldn't remember and had already recycled it. So I had to search them out. Annoyingly, the actual product website doesn't list them at all--WTF?--and the best place for instructions are the Amazon product reviews. So it would be helpful to have the instructions on the bottle.- Speaking of the bottle, I hate the small tubes. Especially since everyone is going to need a different amount, why not just put it in one big bottle? Less waste for sure and more likely a bigger pump which would make it easier. It was a huge PITA to spritz that little bottle and there was always some left that couldn't be pumped out. I had planned on using the entire vile per day (since I have lots of hair) but I got tired about 3/4 of the way through. A bigger bottle would also be more convenient to store (tubes don't stand up and they obviously roll, so they need to be thrown in a drawer).+ The smell is quite pleasant and does not last long. I could only smell it as I was spritzing it. My 6yo son even recognized it as vanilla.+ I was impressed by the quality of the shower (""activating"") cap. I have a large head plus a lot of hair and, honestly, most shower caps don't fit or the elastic isn't strong enough to keep my hair contained without also being in a pony tail or clip of some sort. But this one was large enough and had strong enough elastic that I wasn't worried about failure at all. I will definitely keep this to use post-treatment. It has actually saved me the $5 of buying the shower cap I usually use (Betty Dain Stylish Design Mold Resistant Shower Cap). All that said, I don't see the point of the cap at all. You're out of the shower and using it on towel-dried hair--what good does putting it in a cap do? Maybe keep it damper longer?RESULTSI saw and felt zero improvement the first day. The second day I noticed that my hair felt a little better, but it didn't really help with the flyaways I normally experience. Day three was the best overall, with the ends feeling not nearly as dry and damaged as they usually do. But, this leads me to believe there's a cumulative effect, and as expensive as it is, there's no way I'm using this on my hair every day or even every other day.So overall I give it two stars. It did give some results, but not nearly what I'd hope for at that price and not something I can fiscally continue on a regular basis. Add the bad packaging decisions to that and I just can't recommend this product.** Edited 5/10/15 to add a picture of the instructions. I dug through my recycling to find it!","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R153PW3HIOR4FR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYZY5XU#wasThisHelpful","R153PW3HIOR4FR","A14DNCG5WHM86Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DNCG5WHM86Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always have a box of disposable gloves in my kitchen for messy tasks like working with raw bacon and raw chicken or cleaning the sink with bleach. For the food issues, I will stick with regular gloves (I've used other varieties of Venom gloves). But for the chemicals that might splash? I'd definitely use these.My husband said they are a godsend when staining wood. I've seen regular disposable gloves actually disintegrate after a bit of use, but these stayed intact throughout the whole project!I have seen others mention that these gloves can be reused. I agree they COULD be, but take that with a grain of salt. If you are THAT type of person, these may be just the ticket. But honestly, for me, I don't want to take the time to wash/rinse them, peel them off (or pull them off then turn them right side out), dry them, etc. I typically just want to pull off the gloves (grab the glove at the wrist and pull them off over the messy part of the glove) and toss them. So for me, at 40c a piece, these are a definitely gloves to keep for more specialized usage.But I'm definitely glad we now have these in our arsenal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C5PNURUCCEKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VEEKVQ4#wasThisHelpful","R1C5PNURUCCEKP","A14DNCG5WHM86Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DNCG5WHM86Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First things first, I love the way they fit in my ears. Once they're in your ear canal, you just lock them in and they are NOT coming out, even if you drop your phone or mp3 player. That alone is almost worth the price.They sound really good playing everything I threw at it (classical, jazz, top 40, bass, spoken word, etc.) but I am NOT a big audiophile. I had no issues with muddled sounds.I don't have an Android so I couldn't test how they worked with the controls, but I used it for a few phone calls and it worked perfectly.I like the flat cable. It has a movable locking clip that secures the cord to your clothes.Overall, the quality is very solid and I'd say they are definitely worth the $70 price tag.

"To be honest, I didn't pay close attention when requesting this book--I mistook the Grade Level 4-7 as the age level. (I have a 6yo and wanted this for him as his first chapter book or as something we could read together). Unfortunately, it was a bit too old for him. Since it was above his reading level (no fault of the book--only my lack of attention), I tried reading it to him, but it was just outside his comprehension level and his mind wandered after just a few paragraphs. (I don't mind explaining what things are or defining words for him, but there was SO much of it I had to explain that it was hard to read.)That said, the first chapter sucked me in. We learn Genuine's back story and that she's a wish-fetcher and the chapter ends with her and her Grandma thinking how fetching others' wishes can eventually help them. Of course I had to read the whole thing myself to see what happened!Overall it was a pretty quick and enjoyable read. You could almost hear young Genuine in your head and the dialogue and turns-of-phrase put you right in the small town south.

"** ITEM RECEIVED FREE FOR REVIEW **I recently purchased another great item from this Made in the USA company (NeverCurl - Stops Rug Corner Curling) and they offered this item to me for free if I would review it.I am always on the lookout for cool cell phone accessories, so accepting this item was a no-brainer for me. We tested it out in DC-suburbia driving conditions on a Mazda CX-9 with an iPhone 5S and iPhone 6+. Both obviously fit when placed flat and both actually fit in the angled grooves as well (we both have thinnish cases) without any trimming necessary.Honestly, at first we weren't thrilled with it, because the 6+ tended to be a bit top-heavy and it came flying out of the holder after a gas-fueled start from a red light (hubby apparently thinks he's a race car driver). But, to be fair, we realized that the holder had been sitting (or perched, possibly precariously) on the curved portion of our dashboard. Once we put the holder on a flatter section of dashboard, it held much more firmly. It held up very nicely for all of the driving we did after that. However, that said, I'm not ready to give up my Mountek nGroove Snap 2 Magnetic Car Mount for this holder, but I do like it more for just tossing a phone or sunglasses on the dash so they don't fly around.For the price, I'd say this is a definite winner. I would do 4.5 stars if I could, but am rounding up to 5 because it fits a variety of phones, can be trimmed to fit around cases, is easy to move between cars, is inexpensive, and is Made in the USA.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BEIZD24RPNI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOZY4PA#wasThisHelpful","R3BEIZD24RPNI2","A14DNCG5WHM86Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DNCG5WHM86Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, I paid about $15 for this at a warehouse club. And honestly, at that price I think it was overpriced. I can see this in a $5 clearance bin and that would be worth it.At first glance, I thought the plastic display bin was for the mixing of the paint so all the paints would stay together. It says that's what it's for, but you need to mix each paint in its own bucket (you need to empty the powder in THEN fill water to the line on the bucket). I guess you could put the paint in there after it's mixed, but there are cutouts for the brush and paint bucket (see photo) so it didn't seem like dumping the paint in there would be a great idea. But, keeping the paint in individual buckets was neat, too.I also first thought I'd be able to mix small portions of the paint for more than one day of use, but unless you want to play around with how much water to add to how much powder, you need to make the whole batch at once. I ended up having the kids choose four colors for one day and saving four colors for another day.The powder does not mix in well. I happened to do the white first and it looked nice and smooth (although VERY thin) but the colors were horrible. They were bubbly and foamy and never got smooth (I even got out a mini whisk). I had expected more of an actual paint consistency--but it almost looked like watercolor water with barely any viscosity to it. And if it sat for more than a minute or two, you had to stir it up again.The brown was also like that. Orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple were clumpy foamy messes. Red was the strangest of the bunch and that was like clumpy wet paste.As you were painting it didn't seem like any kind of paint at all--it was super thin with more viscous clumps now and again. And the cheap brushes (see next item) didn't hold much paint so it took forever to actually paint anything. You also had to keep stirring otherwise it would all clump up at the bottom.The included foam brushes were super cheap--much worse than dollar store foam brushes. They barely lasted through the 30 minutes of painting and my kids are gentle. I think you were supposed to mix the paint with them as well but that didn't seem like a good idea.It does look cool as it dries, though (it just looks like regular chalk)--and the kids liked that.So overall, my kids (6 and 3) had a great time and it got us all out of the house for a brief stint one afternoon during spring break (and we still have another session to go to use the last four colors). I'm glad we did it, but I wouldn't buy this again (I actually briefly thought about returning it) and I certainly wouldn't pay as much as I did. I think next time I will google a recipe and make it myself.***EDITED 4/2/15 TO ADD: Looking at the drawings the next day, they are much brighter and thicker than you'd get with normal chalk...which I'm guessing means they will last longer, too.

"I bought this hoping our family would like it enough to make the switch--or at least substitute it off and on because I'm trying to be a good mom and get more whole grains in our meals. Unfortunately, this just didn't taste that great.I made it with butter and Parmesan like I normally do and to my more refined (comparing to my 6yo!) palate there is no way this would ever pass for normal pasta. Maybe if it got buried under my super delicious thick spaghetti sauce it would be more passable...Was it awful? No.Was I clamoring for seconds? No.Did my picky 6yo eat it? Yes - and I was gobsmacked.Did my noodle-loving 3yo eat it? No, because it wasn't the right color.I haven't tried any other whole grain pastas, but if this stuff is any indication...I won't be rushing to try any in the future. We don't eat that much pasta anyway, so it's not a big deal (to me) to eat the stuff that we really like.So three stars for passable, but not terribly enjoyable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11GMJ7L5A2XZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBK9XL8#wasThisHelpful","R11GMJ7L5A2XZZ","A14DNCG5WHM86Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DNCG5WHM86Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have just-past-shoulder-length wavy hair that gets frizzy upon drying. I have a cupboard full of products that try to combat this, and most are okay. I would say this one is slightly above average in that when my hair actually does dry, it doesn't look frizzy at all.

"I chose this book because it fits our family--my husband likes to build things, we have a son, AND we have a Boston Terrier (though her name is Maggie, not Gus!)...and this is definitely a project that could happen in our lives.It's a cute story of a father and son building a wood fort in the backyard, starting with drawing the plans then going to the hardware store, starting the build, stopping for lunch, painting, and then enjoying the end results together.I will say that I am fond of kids books that rhyme, so right off the bat I liked this book. That said, sometimes the rhythm of the rhyme is off by a word here or there which drives me nuts...but this book doesn't succumb to that issue. YAY!The drawings are bright and colorful. Both my 5yo and 2yo like the story and ask for it often.The only proofreading/editorial issue I have is that the plans show a 15x18x12 ""fort""--much larger than any normal kid fort would be AND much larger than the actual fort ends up being. Does it matter in any sense? No. But I'm an editor and it jumped out at me because I'm trained to look at things like that. :)All that said, overall I give it four stars because I think the age range is a bit off.

"I was very interested in trying this model Vitamix as I currently own an older model (the 5000) and have been drooling over the newer features. No, there was nothing at all wrong with my 5000 and it still worked perfectly but I really liked the newer container with the better handle grip...and the grass is always greener, right?The short version?If you have an older model that still works, there really is no need to spend the money to upgrade. There are slight differences between the two, but each gives you the same results. If you've never had a Vitamix and are tempted, you would not go wrong with this model.THE MINOR DIFFERENCES:5000: Nothing happens when you plug it in.6300: When you plug it in, a blue light comes on (see photos).5000: The lid is a bit hard to get on.6300: The lid style changed and it's much easier to get on/off.5000: The container has a simple plastic handle.6300: The container style has changed and it has a more molded hand grip (see photos) which makes it easier to handle.5000: There are two toggle switches--one to switch from variable to high speed and one to turn the machine on/off.6300: There are two toggle switches--one for pulse and one to start/stop the machine (the machine is ON when you plug it in).5000: When making a smoothie (juice, yogurt, protein powder, frozen whole strawberries), I just use high speed and it works fine.6300: When making a smoothie, there's a smoothie setting. It wasn't as powerful as the high speed setting on the 5000 but it did get it mixed it just took a bit longer.Overall, it's a great machine. That said, I personally don't see the need for the specific settings (smoothie, frozen desserts, soup) but they don't hurt anything. I've also never had a need for the pulse setting, but now that I have it, I will try it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UHO7A05H9G2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K8NKYSC#wasThisHelpful","R3UHO7A05H9G2","A14DNCG5WHM86Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DNCG5WHM86Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*NOTE* This review will be updated once we do a complete install--we were going to install it in our current home but then found out we were moving so didn't want to go through the full installation just to have to remove it in two months. So we only briefly set up one camera. That said, our new house will be a MUCH better fit for the system as we have no view at all of the driveway/front of house and our office will be downstairs so we can always have the monitors on.So, a few quick notes on what we've experienced so far:Everything seems sturdy and well-built. I would have thought the included cables would be white, not black, as most soffits are on the white spectrum and a black cable seems to stick out a bit (but this isn't a deal breaker). Hubby said the setup was easy with the QR codes. He did notice that the connectors that go into DVR box are a little loose so we kept losing the signal. We set up one camera in a second story window pointing at our driveway and were able to detect movement (and were also able to see the red light from the driveway when it was dark out).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZZ58OHKFSC0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2N6O20#wasThisHelpful","R2ZZ58OHKFSC0B","A14DNCG5WHM86Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14DNCG5WHM86Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hopes Peak Academy is where Super High School Level geniuses attend, but they hold a lottery every year to invite a normal student to attend.Makoto Naegi is a completely normal kid with super high school luck, as he has won the Hopes Peak Lottery. Sadly, it turns out to have been super BAD luck, since upon arriving to the school, he blacks out, waking to find he is trapped in the school with his new classmates and a maniacal living teddy bear named Monokuma who informs them the only way to leave is to kill someone. Let the games begin!I had lots of fun with this series. It is a pretty unbelievable premise, but I trusted the show to give some sort of explanation by the end and my trust was not betrayed. The characters dont get a whole lot of development, since this is very much a plot driven show. The murder mysteries and the mystery of the school were lots of fun and the story flowed along fairly well. Monokuma was hands down my favorite character.I have never played or heard of the game that this was based before watching the show. I had read somewhat mixed reviews about it, one from someone who had played the game stating that it was confusing and left lots of stuff out.The only thing that confused me was the ending, which after some lengthly wiki reading, turns out to have been very close to the game. Actually, it seems to me that the show followed the game very closely. The game is called DanganRonpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (dangan' means bullet and ronpa' means refutation in Japanese). The game is the first in a series and it seems that other games flesh out the original story quite bit. I hope another one of the games get adapted :)One thing I thought was kind of fun about this show is that it is really, really, really obvious that it is based on a visual novel. It does things like introduce each character with their own character sheet, frequently give you data in a game like format (like the way you find clues), and for the trials Naegi gets Truth Bullets and you can totally tell he is the player character. I liked how the show embraced its roots, but it might bug other people.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UX3R8ZPQ32MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146628T4#wasThisHelpful","R2UX3R8ZPQ32MW","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Akihito Kanbara is a second year high school student, a member of the literature club, and an immortal half yomu. The last one is good, because when he meets first year Mirai Kuriyama, she shoves a sword made from her blood through his chest. Mirai is from a long line of yomu hunters and her clan has long been shunned due to their strange blood manipulation abilities. For some reason, she seems it have it out for Akihito and keeps trying to kill him while he tries to befriend her.Talk about a rough introduction. Despite not being able to die, Akihito still feels pain. And because he is indestructible, he doesnt seem to have bothered to learn any sort of basic defense, while Mirai is a trained warrior. So he gets stabbed a lot. Eventually they call a ceasefire (she agrees to stop stabbing him), which was a relief. It was kind of hard to accept his interest in her when she kept making him bleed.I kind of expected to hate Mirai, since she is the sort of character that normally annoyed me, but I actually liked her. Unlike so many cutesy characters, she actually seemed cute. She also turns out not to be as dumb and annoying as you might assume from her initial treatment of the main character.Both Akihito and Mirai had rough pasts. Through their friendship they start to heal and move forward. Then the ending comes and shatters everything. Surprising information is revealed and something equaling surprising occurs. There is a little bit of weirdness in the last episode, but overall the ending actually made me like the series more (good endings really make a difference).Beyond the Boundary is an entertaining show. At only 12 episodes, it is the perfect length to tell the story it starts out to tell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YNV99P0EQ2QE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010CVUXY4#wasThisHelpful","R2YNV99P0EQ2QE","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my third puzzle feeder. My first one was a Catit Design Senses Treat Maze and the second was one of those little treat balls. I really liked those two, but the ball was kind of messy and I have 4 cats, so one food bowl seemed cruel. So I decided to try this one out.Ever since I was introduced to puzzle feeders I have loved the idea. Not only does it slow down my cats eating (so less throw up!), it makes them think, keeping both them and me entertained. It is lots of fun to watch them figure out a new bowl :) This was wasn't too difficult for them, within 10 minutes of sniffing and poking at it, the smartest cat of the bunch had it figured out. Her less intelligent followers were at least intelligent enough to copy her and within 15 minutes they had all snagged some food.My biggest complaint is that this bowl tends to make great journeys across my kitchen floor. I fill it up in the morning on one end and by evening it is on the other side of the room. I have half hearty attempted to solve the problem with little success. I will note though that there is a ceramic version of this bowl available which might not have this problem. Keep that in mind when purchasing.If your cat is new to puzzle feeders, I would recommend starting them off with one of the ball styles. If they can't handle that, don't torture them with this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ABSAGITH997Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VH1EZA#wasThisHelpful","R1ABSAGITH997Z","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This warmer is just as pretty as the pictures suggest. I looked at a dozen different warmers before settling on this one and overall I am quite pleased. I got it specifically to heat wax tarts, though it can be used for aromatic oils as well (though this specific color only has 'wax' in the title, other colors include wax, so it is intended for both).I used some wax tarts I picked up from Walmart. Initially it took about 45 minutes to heat the cube enough to melt it and produce scent. Even if you've never heated wax before, you can probably tell that is way too long. Fortunately, on the subsequent uses it worked much faster. The problem is that the plate is a little too far from the bulb, so it doesn't get very hot. Once the wax has melted and the surface area has increased, then it doesn't need as much heat to remelt it. I have heard that you are supposed to replace the wax after every use, but I find that extremely wasteful, since the wax I use has lasted up to 20 hours worth of burning (I don't leave my warmer on all the time).Since I need maximum heat to use this warmer with wax, I don't really use the dimming function, but I think it would be really useful with oils.In summery, I love the way this warmer looks and if you reuse wax than its functionality is acceptable as well. I am excited to try it with oil, but have a  lot of wax that needs to be used up first!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NXV6823894XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XGD0YU#wasThisHelpful","R3NXV6823894XO","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Make sure you order this product based on the US size!! It is clearly marked when you chose the size, so it shouldn't be hard to pick the right one. I am a US medium (8-10) so I ordered the XL and it fit great. It is a bit of a wiggle to get into, but once on it is comfortable and very cute.You can't tell from the pictures at all, but the suit part under the dress is light colored (white I think) on the torso and black for the bottom, which is actually in a swim short style instead of regular bikini style bottoms.

I have been looking for a swim dress suit like this for ages, but found that they are not really that popular a style in stores here. Most of the swim dresses on Amazon seem to come from China.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21E9AZW4PFMBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V0MODOQ#wasThisHelpful","R21E9AZW4PFMBL","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hibito is living his dream on the moon and loving every minute. Except the minutes he is about to encounter after a soon-to-occur disaster.Hibito's moon arc is my favorite story in the series. The exciting stuff all takes place in this set, but the repercussions continue on until the end of the series. Hibito finally gets some attention and growth as a character.Mutta also gets some excitement in this set as he starts his astronaut training! (Finally!) Perhaps to honor by Hibitos moon excitement, Muttas first training is a survival training, involving a long trek through the desert.

"This organizer arrives assembled, all you just have to put the drawers on the rack. It doesn't seem very big, but it holds quite a lot. The drawers slide in and out smoothly, and the design prevents you from pulling the drawers out vertically. There is a decent amount of space between the two drawers for taller things. I use it as a craft supply organizer, but it would probably work great for beauty produces or small kitchen things, like spices or measuring cups.The biggest problem I had with this drawer set, is that it's too long to fit in most places I tried to stick it. The width is good, but I wish it had been made wider and shorter. For now it is stowed on the floor, which is not very convenient.Still, this is a great little set. It's light, but seems solidly constructed, smooth drawer action, space between drawers, and it looks nice too. With only the complaint of it being too long, I am overall very happy with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQG68EVUWIH8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWSVFMO#wasThisHelpful","RQG68EVUWIH8U","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yato is a very minor god without so much as a single shrine to his name. This is a fact he intends to change, one 5 yen coin at a time. After saving a girl named Hiyori from a traffic accident, she tracks him down and befriends him. Then they are joined by Yukine, who has the ability to transform into a sacred treasure, a weapon that can be used by a god. Together the three of them battle beings called you and slowly learn about Yatos past.I quite enjoyed this series and Yato as a character really grew on me. His past isnt particularly detailed, but it does a good job of illustrating how and why he ended up as he did. Most of the story is him developing relationships with Hiyori and Yukine, something that develops into a particularly great scene.The ending wraps up the show nicely, but the manga is still running and a second season was announced 3/31/15. There is also an OVA, but it is not available domestically. I believe it is just a side story though, so not essential to the main storyline.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5275YU1W6FAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WF9LL7A#wasThisHelpful","R5275YU1W6FAN","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yuuki Hase notices that his classmate Kaori Kujomiya always seems to be alone, so he decides to try and befriend her. She rebuffs his overtures at first, but soon reveals that it isnt that she is unfriendly, she just suffers a condition that causes her memory to be reset every week. Its hard to make friends when you cant remember them, but Yuuki is determined to make it happen.This was a cute show. At some points Yuukis obsession with Kaori becomes annoying/worrisome, but overall they have a good relationship. It was actually kind of funny how long it took Yuuki to realize he actually had a crush on Kaori (the only person denser than him is Kaori).My favorite part of the series was actually the subplot that involved to secondary characters (Kiryuu and Saki). It was cute and they are my two favorite characters :)The premise is an interesting idea and the show does a fairly good job of tackling the issue in a believable way. I think the biggest weaknesses were that it goes kind of slowly at times and in the end I couldnt really buy into the reason for Kaoris memory impairment. But for the most part it is a sweet little story of romance and friendship.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q2EVNAR3RKH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7ORN8K#wasThisHelpful","R1Q2EVNAR3RKH3","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set first focuses on Hibito and the launch (though from Muttas perspective, not Hibito's), then finishes up with the end of the astronaut exam and the results.Trivia: When Hibito makes it to the moon, he is dubbed the Moon Rabbit (or something like that) by the Japanese media. This is because the Japanese, instead of seeing the Man in the Moon, see a rabbit pounding mochi (rice cake).Hibitos screen time is steady growing, which I enjoyed, as Hibito is actually a very interesting character. Kenji and Serika also get more attention, each get their own episode telling their backstory and fleshing them out as characters. An eccentric new character is also introduced.This set contains episodes 27-38 (12 episodes) out 99 total. At this rate, the last set (number 8 at the current) should come out  around April 2016.

"Kyosuke Hyobu is the leader of the secret ESPers organization PANDORA. The organization is dedicated to fighting those who would entrap, enslave, or kill ESPers. Sometimes their methods are a little questionable.Hyobu reminds me a lot of Magneto (X-Men). He is dedicated to the protection of his kind, but a little less than considerate for normal humans. As he is the central character of the series, you tend to sympathize with him more than not, even as you recognize that his ideas are flawed (speaking as normal human that is).This series is a spinoff of a show called 'Psychic Squad' ( Zettai Karen Children), which I had never heard of, much less seen before watching this show. As far as I can tell, this series takes place either in the middle or towards the end of the original series (at least, in this series the kids are in their early teens instead of being 10). The main characters for the original show show up briefly, but this series is really dedicated to their enemy, Hyobu.I was able to follow along with the series just fine without having seen the original show. I was a little confused when the girls showed up, but I could still understand their role as opponents of PANDORA.I think Hyobu was a interesting character and he straddled the line between good and bad guy really well. His backstory was well done too. There were things I didn't particularly like about this series (some of the characters were annoying and the plot not terribly strong at points), but I really liked Hyobu and thus found the series an entertaining experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L1N2EN3NSXY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R9O4YTI#wasThisHelpful","R2L1N2EN3NSXY0","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""On the three-hundredth anniversary of my birth, I finally managed to conquer the world.""So starts Perfect State, a clever little sci-fi story about reality, emperors, and dating. The main character, God-Emperor Kairominas, was surprisingly easy to relate to, even though, as of the quarter-century anniversary of my birth, I have yet to conquer anything. The other characters don't get much time to shine, but Shale and Bask made good use of their appearances and I liked both of them a great deal.The story is fast paced and humorous, though the ending gets a little... serious. However, it is a really short story (about 71 Kindle pages). Calling it a ""novella"" feels misleading. To me, novella implies a short novel. Perfect States is really just a short story. I would have purchased it regardless, but would have preferred to know how short it was beforehand (NOTE: when I purchased the book and at the time I wrote the review, the page count for this story had not been posted).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GROMPK84HNTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZSTXL4#wasThisHelpful","R1GROMPK84HNTI","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shio Ogura is a Japanese high school student with an obsessive love of guns and military. This alianates her from her more normal classmates, but during a class trip to Taiwan it seems like one of them might be willing to befriend her. In Shios moment of happiness, she is attacked by monsters and the area turns into a war zone. In order to save her new friend, she must join forces with agents known as E-Gene Holders and discover her own e-gene - the soul of Oda Nobunaga, one of Japans greatest warlords.I started watching this on a whim and was surprised to find myself continuing all the way to the end. I was interested in Shios slightly unconventional attitude (she had lots of fun fighting and killing monsters, but it wasnt exactly how she had planned to live her life). As with any series involving historical characters, it was fun to see who they brought in and what weird powers they might have. My two favorites were Newton's power of gravity manipulation and Gandhi's force field ability.But the thing that impressed me the most was the ending. This isnt a very complicated series and the characters dont get a whole lot of development, but the ending contains a nice twist, a pretty good explanation for events, and a rousingly fun battle scene.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMNS24XKAZ1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXWCPFI#wasThisHelpful","R3BMNS24XKAZ1Z","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Azuma Kazuma has a dream - to make a bread that will represent Japan itself and replace rice as a breakfast staple. In order to help achieve his dream, he wants to get a job at Pantasia, a world famous bakery. But the path to JaPAN (pun used extensively in the series, 'pan' being the Japanese word for bread) is not going to be easy!I saw this series years ago and still remember it with great fondness. The baking battles can get pretty ridiculous and the taster's reaction to the bread often hilarious. It generally transports them to an exotic local, such as in one case, Heaven. The characters are fun and Azuma likable, though not very bright. But who needs smarts with his skills?If you enjoy baking, it is fun to see the different techniques used and laugh at the seriousness baking is treated with.

"During the Iron Age somewhere in Europe, a young boy named Horus (Hols) pulls the mystical Sword of the Sun out of the shoulder of a rock giant. At the behest of his dying father, Horus returns to his people's ancestral lands. He finds the people of his homeland terrorized by the ice demon Grundewald and he vows to defeat him and protect the village. He makes several new friends, one of them a young girl with a lovely voice whom might not be entirely trustworthy...While watching this movie I assumed that it was based off of some Norse legend, but a little internet research revealed that it was actually based on an ancient legend of the Ainu, the aboriginal people of Northern Japan. The European setting was chosen to make it more appealing to international viewers. So the title is misleading - there is no indication of anything Norse and it is never even suggested that Horus is a prince.The animation is quite good considering its age and my biggest gripe was about the quality of the picture. I watched this movie streaming over Netflix, which could account for some of the lapse in quality, but I think most of the problem is that it is just old. The voices are noticeable from a different era as well (I watched it in English, the only option on Netflix), which simply added to its charm.This movie is a fun experience and it is very different from anything produced today. It is short, simple, and sweet. But as I said before, it is an OLD movie and you have to be prepared for it going in, else you might give up early on. I enjoyed it, but it isn't going to become a favorite of mine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LGIJNTDWN3S9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEA6K0A#wasThisHelpful","R1LGIJNTDWN3S9","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE 3/27/15: Canary released a software update that adds some features and settings. It is now easier to make emergency calls from the app, they added a panic widget for iOS, and they finally got preferences for setting the default home mode (Disarmed or Private)!I got this device through the Indiegogo campaign and have had it running for a couple of weeks. I have run into a few minor issues in the app, and twice was unable to access the live stream, though I still received notifications.Setup was really, really easy. Steps: 1. Remove device from packaging2. Plug it in3. Download and launch app4. Follow the app's very simple directions (read a couple of screens, allow it to sense your location and deliver notifications, then connect your phone to Canary using yellow cord and let it sync, then update)5. Spy on your cats, dogs, children, or unsuspecting home intruders!And that is it! So simple. Mine was up and running in less than 10 minutes, after which I immediately left the house and not long after was showing my family what my empty living room looked like LIVE!The Canary automatically detects when you (or all users, if you have more than one person on the account) leave home and puts itself into Armed Mode, where it automatically records video when it senses movement and then sends you a notification. When you return, it goes into Disarmed mode, which continues to record, but doesn't send notifications. There is also a Privacy mode where the camera turns off entirely. So far my biggest complaint with the Canary is that the Privacy mode isn't the default for while I am home. I have to change it every time. UPDATE 3/27/15 This has been fixed in the software update today, allowing me to finally set Privacy as the default mode for when I am home!You can also view a live stream at anytime, though there is bit of a load time. A couple of times the Canary app has said that this feature was offline, but I would still get notifications.The video quality is really good. Even the live stream looks great. The audio isn't bad either.You can teach the Canary to learn movement patterns over time, which sounds really useful for people with pets. I have been training my Canary, but so far it hasnt done anything different. I hold on to hope though (99% of my notifications are my cats walking through the living room).In addition to the camera features, the Canary also has a speaker (to play a siren noise and scare the bejeezus out of home intruders or friends) and a sensor to measure temperature, humidity, and air pollution. These took about a day to show up in the app, and only show a day's worth of data.The application is really slick looking and easy to use (I am using the iPhone app). It is a little bit slim on content, but I expect enhancements moving forward. I have run into a few of bugs in the app that show up inconstantly, nothing too major, but getting a little annoying (such as auto arm working intermittently).There is no required subscription fee, though Canary will offer a subscription service in the future (still not available as of 3/25). Oddly, when go to the Subscription section of the app it lists me as having a free trial"" which includes 7 days cloud video storage, 50 permanently saved video clips, and video recording in both Armed and Disarmed modes. However, going to their website and looking at the plans, that is what is included in the cheapest paid tier plan. The (free) Basic Security only offers 12 hours video storage, 5 saved clips, and video recording only in armed mode. So I may bumped down at some point, which would make me slightly less happy with the device. 12 hours isn't very long. The cheapest plan is currently listed at $9 a month. Not that expensive. But I got the Canary so I wouldn't have to have a subscription at all. The Indiegogo page promised subscriptions wouldn't be necessary, but never state what the minimum data options would be.A comparative product would be the Piper (which I have not used and am not an expert on). Piper is compatible with Z-Wave devices and has a movable camera, neither of which the Canary supports. But apparently Piper does not have a night vision camera, while Canary does. Personally, I love the night vision camera and think it is worth the more extra cost (at the the time of this review, Piper (black) is $190.99 and Canary (black) is $249.00). However, I am now considering getting a Piper as well :)NOTE: I have been informed that the new Piper NV has a night vision camera. It is currently only available on the Piper website and costs $269 + shipping.In summery, I love the Canary. But there is room for improvement (lots of features I would love to have, such as the ability to save a video to my camera roll) and I am a little apprehensive about the subscription, hence a 4 star rating despite a fairly glowing review. I think there is great potential here and I am excited to see the Canary grow and evolve.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MDZFMKAIPS4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NW31YSE#wasThisHelpful","R1MDZFMKAIPS4W","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Maou (Demon King) Satan is well on his way to world domination when he is predictably thwarted by a valiant hero. He makes a hasty retreat to another world - modern day Tokyo. What is a demon king to do in a world without magic? Flip burgers of course.Ah how the mighty are brought low. Without his magic, Maou becomes a hard working, honest, and generally good guy. Of course, it is possible he was a nice guy before and only wanted to conquer Ente Isla for the peoples own good, but that side of him is never really explored, so it is hard to tell (too bad, it would have been interesting). But as the dedicated part timer, he strives hard so that he and his friend are able to eat and pay rent. He continues to claim that his plan is to work to the top and take over Japan, but as other characters point out, that is very unlikely to happen, even with his elongated life span.Most of the story is slice of life and the rest magical battles. The story takes place almost exclusively on Earth, but naturally characters from Ente Isla make there way towards Maou for various reasons. There isn't a whole lot of overall plot, but the story does move along as Satan advances through the ranks of McRonalds and makes new friends.I thoroughly enjoyed the humor of the series and Maou's dedicated work ethic. I liked most of the characters and surprisingly the magic system as well (not very complicated, but something different from normal). I watched it with a group of friends and we all enjoyed it.

But I didn't realize the ambitious scope of the series until the end. There are 4 basic plot lines and each one brings up different difficult issues. This set wraps up Mamoru's plot and deals with the terrifying question  - if you are certain that your village wants you dead and certain that you can't survive outside of the village, what do you do?

"Hachiman Hikigaya is a realist. He knows that life is unfair and everyone is a liar. He has learned to deal with it: avoid people as much as possible and if necessary, ward them off with painfully cutting remarks. But after one pessimistic essay about his high school life, his teacher forces him to join the Service Club in an attempt to improve his personalty. There is only other member of the club: Yukino Yukinoshita, the schools prettiest girl, though it turns out she has plenty of problems of her own.The humor is this series is pessimistic, wry, and pretty darn entertaining if you like that sort of thing. Hikigaya is a great character, full of down to earth pessimism and a sharp tongue. He is also fairly good at understanding people and how to deal with them, but due to his antisocial attitude, he simply uses that ability keep people away from him. This is both amusing and a little sad. Yukino is surprisingly likable despite her superior attitude. Partly because she is as pretty and as smart as she thinks she is. It can be annoying, but if it is true, why try to deny it? The other characters have their own quirks and appeal. There is the nice girl who is forced to deal with her try-to-please-everyone attitude, the nice guy who is really as nice as he seems, the guy who looks like a girl from a shojo series, and assorted others.The series is formatted into short story arcs with a little bit of a overarching story involving a car accident. One friend I watched this with complained that nothing had happened by the end of the series and this is mostly correct. Characters' relationships evolve, but not to any major levels. Hikigaya is never cured of his attitude problem. But it is the journey that is entertaining. Plus, a second season of Snafu was recently announced, though it wasn't said when it would air. So there is more Hikigaya goodness to look forward to!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ILSFMXHXFDFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J9IP7NO#wasThisHelpful","R3ILSFMXHXFDFC","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One day they receive invitations from to different world called ""Little Garden"" and are suddenly transported there where the sender of the invitations, Black Rabbit, explains that the world centers around playing games.This series is great entertainment. If you stop and think about it too much it sort of falls apart, but if you just sit back and relax you can have a very enjoyable experience. The plot is not complicated. The characters are not deep. The world isn't even really explained all that well. But watching a bunch of super powered and super confident teens set loose in a magical world where everything is decided through games is pretty fun. Izayoi was especially fun due to his ability.The series is kind of short with only 10 episodes.

"A hero's job is to defeat demons and save people from their vicious clutches. So when humanities' greatest Hero invades the Demon King's palace, it is his aim to defeat the demons once and for all. But the Demon King ends up being a pretty young woman with an unusual proposition for the young hero - an alliance to bring about a peaceful end to the their war.Maoyu is a refreshing series. Instead of fighting desperate battles to end the war, Maou plants potatoes and works to manipulate economies. There are discussions about how war affects the economy, technological advancement, and politics. This series is often compared to Spice & Wolf in how it talks about economics, but I thought Maoyu handled the technical stuff much better (and I liked the series better overall). The characters are fun and slightly more complex than shown at first glance.If there is one thing I didn't like about the series it would be the odd amount of fan service . If felt strange for Maou to be such an intelligent person in one scene and then bosom bait in the next. It also made the series feel rather unbalanced.One odd thing about the series is that none of the characters have names. They are referred to by their positions/jobs. So the two main characters, Maou and Yuusha, are literally Demon King and Hero. There is a Older Sister Maid and a Younger Sister Maid and many others like that.Maoyu is a fun show with interesting topics and enjoyable characters. It is only 12 episodes and tells a complete story (so no cliffhanger ending or random cutoff). If you enjoy stories that involve economics and the study of society, then this is the series for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CJGULEUG6L1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOFDKAK#wasThisHelpful","R1CJGULEUG6L1U","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Izuru, Asagi, Kei, Tamaki, and Suruga are a group of genetically engineered teens who were raised and trained to be pilots of giant robots. Sadly, they suck. At school they have earned the title ""Fail Five"" and despite plenty of enthusiasm, they just generally make a mess of things. But when they are chosen to pilot units called AHSMB (Advanced High Standard Multipurpose Battle Device), the discover that it is possible for they to overcome their weakness and save the planet from the aliens that are attacking it.I am not really a fan of mecha, but I'll watch mecha shows if it contains more than cool robots. I started this show expecting to drop it after a few episodes of mindless entertainment. Strangely, I kept watching. I think I was really hooked when the PR campaign started. Suspending disbelief a bit about teenage pilots carrying the fate of the world, the series did a decent job of handling the situation realistically. Sometimes you do need to do a little PR, sometimes you have to raise money where you can, sometimes constantly risking your life will cause stomach problems. The aliens' reason for attacking was interesting, as was the explanation for their incredibly human appearance.The space battles were excellently animated and fun to watch. Normally the fighting is where I start zoning out in mecha shows, but I actually looked forward to the battles in this show most of the time.I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It isn't all awesome though - I found Tamaki incredibly annoying and sometimes the story goes a little slow - but it was great entertainment. Of course, great entertainment doesn't necessarily mean it was a great series, so I won't be recommending it to my friends as a must watch, but for someone looking for a fun space/mecha show, this one should fit the ticket.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38AIAPLNCZRS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J9IP86K#wasThisHelpful","R38AIAPLNCZRS8","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sotobamura is a small, secluded village where the old customs, such as the burial of the dead, are still practiced. Life in Sotobamura is calm and boring. When three old people die in the outskirts of the village, it is marked down as old age or heatstroke. But when a healthy teenage girl expires, it starts to look like the deaths might be connected. The local doctor, Toshio Ozaki, starts to see a pattern--light anemia followed by sudden and inexplicable death-- and suspects an epidemic. But what sort of disease causes its victims to quit their jobs before dying? And what about those families that disappear in the middle of the night in moving vans?I've always been partial towards the idea of vampires in stories, but I rarely like the sort of stories that have vampires in them (a contradiction, I know). But Shiki manages to create a excellent atmosphere of creepiness and uncertainty. The story moves on at a rather languid pace, but it is never boring. Shiki has the sort of feeling of a horror movie, but it isn't scary. The vampires are rather pretty, but very creepy.The story follows a range of characters and not all of them survive, which makes it even more interesting. Shiki is more a story about a village, rather than a character. Not that the characters are unimportant or boring. Most of them are quite likable, which makes their situation a little sad.I really enjoyed Shiki. But I don't think it is a show for everyone. It's biggest appeal is the atmosphere, and if you don't get drawn into it, then there isn't much left for you. When giving this series a try, you should watch at least 3-4 episodes before passing judgment. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!I've been putting off buying Shiki since it was released because I really wanted the complete series in one set (its a space thing). But now the only full set to be released is a SAVE edition? I am now considering buying the two separate parts. The SAVE editions are great for series you want cheap, but for a series you really like, it is probably worth it to shell out the extra cash for a nicer set.PS Shiki is based on a book by Fuyumi Ono, who also wrote the source material for the Ghost Hunt and The Twelve Kingdoms anime.They are very different from Shiki, but both are good so you should go check them out :)UPDATE: I just got my Shiki set today and I must say I am very pleased. It looks like they just took the original two sets and slapped a S.A.V.E label on it. It comes in a sturdy cardboard box with two Blu-ray/DVD sets.UPDATE 6/8/14: I am now confused. I pre-ordered my set directly from Funimation and received it some weeks ago. Today I received another set. The first set was as described in the first update. The second is a single double width blu ray case with all of the DVDs and the standard green S.A.V.E spine. It is a decent set, but not as nice as the first one. The one pictured on Amazon looks like the first set, but I've had problems with Amazon showing the wrong picture for S.A.V.E editions before. So in the end I can't tell what the actual S.A.V.E edition is like. Be aware there might be two types.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H7P72KB24XPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00II6C66E#wasThisHelpful","R1H7P72KB24XPT","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Saki, Shun, Mamoru, Maria, and Satoru are children in a future where everyone has psychic powers that develop during adolescence. They live peacefully in their little, isolated village. Everything is very peaceful. There is no conflict. The citizens are happy. But when the children's curiosity leads them on an adventure that results in them stumbling across forbidden information, this triggers events that could lead the end of the human race....I was hooked on this series after the first episode. But I didn't realize the ambitious scope of the series until the end. I enjoyed it the entire time, but upon finishing it I was in awe. In addition to a well woven story that spans years (there are three major periods when the children are 12, 14, and 26), it raises some very interesting moral questions and dilemmas. It really makes you think.From the New World is one of the best Sci-Fi anime I have ever seen and one of the best anime shows period (and I've seen over 400 anime series). The setting is fascinating, as is the explanation on how this new world came to evolve. The characters are engaging and sympathetic.I watched this series on Crunchyroll, but I can't wait for the DVDs to come out so I can buy them and watch it again :)From the New World was based on a novel and is 25 episodes long.

"During the Iron Age somewhere in Europe, a young boy named Horus (Hols) pulls the mystical Sword of the Sun out of the shoulder of a rock giant. At the behest of his dying father, Horus returns to his people's ancestral lands. He finds the people of his homeland terrorized by the ice demon Grundewald and he vows to defeat him and protect the village. He makes several new friends, one of them a young girl with a lovely voice whom might not be entirely trustworthy...While watching this movie I assumed that it was based off of some Norse legend, but a little internet research revealed that it was actually based on an ancient legend of the Ainu, the aboriginal people of Northern Japan. The European setting was chosen to make it more appealing to international viewers. So the title is misleading - there is no indication of anything Norse and it is never even suggested that Horus is a prince.This is a very simple movie and that is what makes it appealing. The animation is quite good considering its age and my biggest gripe was about the quality of the picture. I watched this movie streaming over Netflix, which could account for some of the lapse in quality, but I think most of the problem is that it is just old. The voices are noticeable from a different era as well (I watched it in English, the only option on Netflix), which simply added to its charm.This movie is a fun experience and it is very different from anything produced today. It is short, simple, and sweet. But as I said before, it is an OLD movie and you have to be prepared for it going in, else you might give up early on. I enjoyed it, but it isn't going to become a favorite of mine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHIZXDY52QZH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009XAZV7K#wasThisHelpful","RHIZXDY52QZH5","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was recently introduced to the bowed psaltery and it was like love at first sight. But I have a tendency of overcoming infatuations pretty quickly, so though I desperately wanted to drop $300 into a nice Master Works psaltery, I refrained and bought this instead as a test run. I expected a cheap toy that would be at tolerable enough to learn on and little else. But I was pleasantly surprised.This is definitely a beginners instrument. 20 strings does limit play (I believe 30 strings is more the standard), though I was pleased at how much I was able to play on it. It also has the notes printed under the strings, which was perfect for a beginner. I initially hated the bow, but it grew on me a bit (still isn't that great, but it works). I've never played a bowed instrument before, so I had to google what the included rosin was for. You are supposed to rough up the surface (like with a knife or screw) and then rub it on the bow strings to give them better traction, which helps prevent screeching.Tuning this instrument is rather difficult. I used my electric guitar tuner, which was great, the problem was that just a tiny turn of the tuner greatly affects the note. It is pretty much impossible to tune it perfectly. I just try to get as close as possible and call it good. If it is all slightly out of tune then it all sounds pretty good.As for sound, it sounds much better than I expected. In fact, it even held up well enough against the $300 Master Works psaltry I fell in love with. They are not equal mind you, but not a dismal difference either. A nicer bow does help with the sound (and reduces screeching).All in all, I love this little guy and think it is an excellent intro to one of the coolest instruments I've played. And the price is great. I looked all over when researching one to get initially and this is the absolutely best price I could find. I am definitely going to want a nicer instrument in the future, but this is perfect to hold me over until then.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPKNNESGAM94L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043NULK4#wasThisHelpful","RPKNNESGAM94L","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wynn's stint into death is much shorter than most folk, lasting just a few minutes. She rejoins Gethin in life and they set about bringing peace between their kingdoms. But though they have already overcome great trials, there is still yet more to come, as something starts causing the disappearances of men and women across the kingdom and strange things click in the shadows.I really enjoyed the first book. I liked the restriction on magic, forcing the characters to use it in interesting ways. I enjoyed the characters of Wynn and Gethin and romance between them. The story was pretty straightforward, but the two aforementioned points made it highly enjoyable.So with the death of the queen, I assumed Inito would focus on the many issues that would arise from reconciling two kingdoms who have long been at odds (the reason for which was never really fleshed out in the first book). But the author got lazy. She simply introduced a new terrible threat and made magic all powerful. Wynn spends most of the book coming up with new spells, which while rather clever at times, mostly just creates a crutch for the story (also, the excerpts at the beginning of each chapter give spoilers). The peace between kingdoms is primarily built between scenes and seems achieved far too easily. The Bad Guy seemed pretty contrived and I was really unimpressed with him. The ending was rushed and awkward, though the epilogue was good.The only thing that saves this book is that Wynn and Gethin are still likable characters and have a good relationship. Good news: a romantic rival is not introduced. I can't really say that their relationship matured much, but it doesn't go downhill.I rather enjoyed the book as I read it, but in the end felt it was pretty generic and felt short of the promise of the first book. After finishing Inito, I found myself wishing I had just stopped after Lunula. However, if you just want to see more romance between Wynn and Gethin, then this book should fit the ticket.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CBEPUBUHEIYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPTY79U#wasThisHelpful","R2CBEPUBUHEIYW","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alibaba is a poor lad who works for various merchants to earn his living. But he dreams of bigger things - such as conquering one of the mysterious towers called ""Dungeons' and becoming fabulously wealthy. But it isn't until he meets a strange boy named Aladdin that he starts working to make his dream a reality.Magi is obviously influenced by stories from The Arabian Nights (and Sinbad later on), but it isn't a retelling. It seems like a colorful children's adventure story, but it quickly dives into themes such as slavery, oppression, discrimination, betrayal, and politics. The characters are rather interesting as well - Alibaba seems like a complete wuss, but proves to be both braver and more complex than initially portrayed. Aladdin seems like naive kid, but he manages to develop and grow over the course of the series (a little anyway). Morgiana starts out a downtrodden slave, but regains enough self worth to become an awesomely strong character. I don't normally like female characters in anime, but I found myself quite fond of Morgiana.This set contains the first 12 episodes of Magi: The Labyrinth (out of 25, and then there is the second series Magi: The Kingdom of Magic which is currently airing, but will probably be around the same length). Set also includes a deluxe booklet and five collectable foil stamped postcards.

"Takashi Natsume sees things that most people can not. Strange creatures called 'yokai' live along side us, interacting with the world, but unseen to most humans. Some are sweet and gentle, others are malevolent and dangerous. Together with his 'bodyguard' Nyanko-sensei, Natsume both battles and befriends the various yokai that come after him for the Book of Friends, a book that binds the names of many different yokai.Natsume Yuujin-chou continues to delight. If you've enjoyed it so far then you will continue to enjoy it. The ending wraps up with a nice visit to Natsume's past in the form of his parents old house and memories of his father. It is not a definitive ending (and the manga is still ending), but does provide a little bit of closure. Of course, I still hold hope for a fifth season.The fourth season is 13 episodes long. Everything comes stored in a long hardcover case that contains the complete series on 2 DVDs and the complete series on 2 Blu-ray discs. Also included is a full color, 28 page hardcover art book.

The cover is modeled after the Book of Friends :)This series does not have a dub, so the only audio option is Japanese.BONUS If you buy this set through NIS America, not only is it cheaper (and has free shipping), but it also comes with a Nyanko-sensei bookmark (while supplies last)!

"Rintaro Okabe considers himself a mad scientist. He spends most of his time inventing useless gadgets and conceiving wild conspiracy theories. Through sheer luck, he and his friend Itaru Hashida actually create a machine that can send text messages to the past. Through their experimentation and tinkering with time, they keep changing their world, though only Okabe is able to remember the previous timeline. But playing around with something like time is bound to have consequences, as Okabe finds out all too well.....I generally don't have much interest in time travel stories. But if the premise sounds interesting, I'll give it a try. The premise of Steins;Gate sounded vaguely entertaining, but I might not have tried it if it hadn't been streaming on Crunchyroll and had high ratings on AnimeNewsNetwork. The first few episodes were fun, but I wasn't really hooked until around 8 episodes in. That is where the story really starts. And boy, it doesn't let up until the end! The story it very intense and fast paced. It was a rather surprising change, after the laid-back, comedic first few episodes. I went from wanting to see more, to NEEDING to see more. In addition to a great story, this series also has great characters. Okabe is the most interesting, and most developed, since he is the main character, but the others each have their chance to shine.This is one of the best anime series I've see in a while. Possibly the best Sci-Fi anime I've EVER seen. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys an exciting and well woven story. Anyone who enjoys stories that make them think a little. Stories that have wacky characters that you come to love, science fiction, thrill, or mystery.

"Saizo Kirigakure is hanging out in the woods one day when the priestess Isanami stumbles across his path. She is being pursued by assassins, but lucky for her, Saizo is a legendary ninja, and he reluctantly whoops the attacker's butts. He then tries to go on his merry way, but Isanami tempts him with an offer of soba. She asks him to take her to Ueda Castle to see Sanada Yukimura, which eventually leads to him to becoming Isanami's bodyguard and one of Yukimura's Brave 10, a group of legendary warriors with the power to change history.This show is entertaining. Its got lots of characters with different powers and lots of fighting. I enjoy history, so it is fun to see all the  famous people and laugh at how they are portrayed. Sanada Yukimore was a real person during the Warring States Period of Japan, though the Brave 10 are a legend. Some of the Braves have names that belonged to real people while others are fictional (Kirigakure Saiz is a real person, Sarutobi Sasuke is not).The plot is a little thin at times and there isn't lots of character development (and most characters are stereotypes). It doesn't have much of an ending (probably doesn't cover all of the manga), though if it follows history you can figure out what comes after.I enjoyed it, but mostly as a one viewing time killer. I wanted to give it a 3.5, but Amazon doesn't allow that and it isn't good enough to be bumped up to 4.If you like ninjas, ninja battles, or historical fiction (with fantasy), then this is a fun show to watch.NIS America releases nice sets. It contains 2 Blu-ray disks in a hardcover slipcase and a full-color, 32-page hardcover art book complete with episode guide, character and world descriptions, production and key art, and more. Bonus features are slim, limited to clean opening and ending, Japanese commercials, and Japanese trailers.

They host radio shows, fight off monsters, and dress up Tadakuni in his sister's school uniform. Throw in their classmates from an all boys school and the girls from an all girls school, a girl on a riverbank who speaks in poetry, and other random people, and and you get to see what a typical high school boy's life is like...This series is so funny and lots of fun.

Then after the credits there is the short High School Girls are Funky, showing that high school girls are nearly as weird as the boys. I, having never been a high school boy and never known any, was both thoroughly amused by their antics and by assurances from several people that it is a very accurate portrayal of real high school boys.The series is 12 episodes followed by at least another episodes worth of additional stories (they will play automatically, or you can find them in special features).

"The last of humanity live within the safety of the 3 walls, protected from the horrors of the outside world - the Titans. Horrendous monsters with an appetite for human flesh, the walls have held them at bay for 100 years and little is expected to change. But change comes in a big way and the walls are no longer enough to protect humanity. Eren, Armin, and Mikasa wittiness terrible horrors on that day and vow to join the Survey Corp and but an end to the Titan menace once and for all...Attack on Titan is a merciless series. No one is safe from the reality that war spares none. Unlike many fighting series where you are happily secure in the knowledge that the heroes will never die, or even lose, the characters in Attack on Titan have no such magical protection. Not that the series is just filled with senseless violence. All of the violence has purpose and propels the story forward with lightning intensity. The pacing is addictive, as soon as one episode finishes you HAVE to start the next one! I made the mistake of watching the first season while the second was still airing. So I had to wait a whole 2 months to finish the series! It was rather agonizing.The characters are surprisingly developed considering how much the series focuses on action. Not just the three main characters, but many of the supporting characters are interesting. The series uses fear to define its characters, that is, how is it that you handle your fear?I am normally pretty neutral towards action shows. But Attack on Titan is much more than an action show. It is a study of the fear, hope, and determination of humanity. It is definitely my favorite show to air in the past couple of years.I can't wait for the DVDs to be released so I can watch this series again!One thing to note though: Attack on Titan is 26 episodes long (looking at Funimation's release habits, I assume this set will contain half the series), but the story doesn't end. I am really hoping for a second season, but I guess the show caught up to the manga, so it will probably be a while.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWRKE00PF7D8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FXBL1IQ#wasThisHelpful","RWRKE00PF7D8H","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I had never given much thought to the manga industry (though I do read lots of manga), but it was absolutely fascinating to learn about. The business side, the creative process, the sheer luck - so much fun. But of course, if this were just a textbook for learning about manga it wouldn't be very entertaining. But the characters, their interactions, friendships, and rivalries were so much fun.Bakuman is definitely in my top 5 favorite manga series. The volumes are really dense, so even though it is 20 volumes, it has about twice the amount of text as a normal Jump series of similar lengths. Seriously, I normally read a volume of manga in 20-30 minutes, but Bakuman took a full hour for each one. And they were never boring. Several nights in a row I would stay up late finishing a volume, or starting a new one because i just had to know what happened next.This box set is really nice. This is my first time buying a manga box set and I am very pleased. Not only was it much cheaper than buying the individual volumes, it comes in a cardboard box that opens up to show all 20 volumes nicely lined up.

"Taichi, Iori, Himeko, Yoshifumi, and Yui are all completely normal high school students, until one day when they all start switching bodies. The switches can happen at any time of day, last different amounts of time, and only occur within their little group. After the initial shock, they start trying to just make it through each day without raising suspicion. Then, as suddenly as it started, it stops. Only something else strange has taken its place...When I initially heard about this series I wasn't the slightest bit interested. I thought it would be filled with awkward/stupid scenes of guys and girls switching bodies. But while there is the awkwardness of guys ending up in their cute female classmates' bodies, it is reasonably handled and then they move on. The thing about this series is that it isn't about the body switching, it is about how the characters handle the body switching and other strange events that happen. The character behind the strangeness seems to be testing the characters', well, character.One thing that should be noted about this series - it is 17 episodes long, but the last 4 episodes were released separately from the first season. I don't know why this was done, but fortunately, all of it is being released domestically, though in two separate sets. This set has the first 13 episodes and the last four are here: Kokoro Connect Ova: Complete Collection [Blu-ray]. I've only seen the first 13 epsidoes since I watched this on Crunchyroll and that is all they had. I intend to finish the series as soon as the OVA is released here.This series is an interesting study of people and relationships. It is interesting to consider yourself in their place - what would you do?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R185NO7IW8CC3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPH7PP8#wasThisHelpful","R185NO7IW8CC3S","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Humanity is in decline. Currently the most prosperous species are ""Fairies"", 10 cm tall creatures with high intelligence and a great love for sweets. The Mediator's job is to act as an arbitrator between the humans and the fairies. Which basically means that she is often swept up in their insane schemes. With the power of the fairies, entire cities are built, then destroyed, over the course of a few days. Mysterious food factories appear on the edge of town. Robotic bread commits suicide. Humans become characters in manga. Time loops. Sweets. Insanity. And dark humor.I heard good things about this series, so I had some hopes for it. I found the first 2 episodes to be rather interesting, but I couldn't tell if I liked the series or not. It took me a few more episodes to finally grasp the humor and come to love the show. The first arc is still my least favorite, but I enjoyed it better the second time around. Yes, I liked this series so much by the end, that I re-watched it with my sister just days after finishing it the first time. (And then again a third time some months later).The humor is both dark and dry, with the Mediator running a witty narrative in her head. The fairies are both adorable and terrifying. I loved them.Finally, I recommend starting the series with episode 10 and then going back to the beginning. 10 is a stand alone episode that is very funny and a great intro to the series. It is also first chronologically (the series runs mostly backwards in time, though that doesn't really matter).I saw this series streaming on Crunchyroll, but I intend to buy the DVDs, just as soon as I confirm that I haven't received them as a Christmas present :)Bonus Feature Note: One on of the discs (I can't remember which, but not the first one), has a set of shorts (I think it was call Survival of the Fittest), that combined equal about one extra episode (and they share the same storyline, so it feels like an episode that was just broken up).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21AHCWE8HUK2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ229WG#wasThisHelpful","R21AHCWE8HUK2S","A1AQ477HH3KQ8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQ477HH3KQ8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a tween, I saw Blade Runner: The Final Cut [HD] - after which I resolved I would read _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep_.  A few decades later, I finally got around to it.  As with most adaptations from books, there are quite a few (and significant) differences between film and text - be forewarned: the differences are so much so, that fans of one medium may not like the other.I was suprised at the way in which the story played out - the pace was slower than I anticipated but Dick's consideration of ""human-ness"" and the contrast between man and machine was much stronger than I expected.  While I had looked forward to some clues as to whether Deckard was indeed an android (a question that fans of the film continue to debate), it seems his answer on the issue is clear (I won't divulge, as I don't want to spoil.)  What reamins with me is the desire on the part of the androids to be ""human"" and the inhumanity of the ""real"" people.  As with most science-fiction, Dick shines a bright, harsh light on contemporary socety, forcing us to reassess and consider uncomfortable truths.While the process of searching for and hunting the androids drove the story, the religion (""Mercerism"") and its message that parallels the plot was a bit of a distraction - perhaps I missed something relevant outside of the story itself, but I found it annoying and thought it got in the way.For fans of science fiction, I assume you have heard of (or read) Philip K. Dick's work; if not, this is a good place to start (I much preferred this to Puttering About in a Small Land).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJQ814OBWYHWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345404475#wasThisHelpful","RJQ814OBWYHWS","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In any series of books, the author runs the risk of getting stale with either the character or the universe s/he creates.  It is therefore a tremendous relief that 16 books in, Jim Butcher still has found ways to keep things fresh and interesting.To briefly summarize, Dresden finds himself working as a banck robber at the behest of Mab with a crew of ne'er do wells, most of whom wish to see Dresedn dead as soon as the heist is successfully concluded.  Specifically what is being stolen (and from whom) is kept secret from the crew (and readers) given the senstive nature of the heist - needless to say, when the details are revealed, it is easy to undestand why such precautions were taken.  As the story unfolds, the sinister tone the last several books have taken becomes even more dark, with an allusion to deeper and darker trouble waiting for Dresden in the future.Fans of the series will not be disappointed; those who have not yet been introduced to Jim Butcher or his Dresden Files are in for a fun take detective noir.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30YR1PP6KHZNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451464397#wasThisHelpful","R30YR1PP6KHZNQ","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading Selcuk Altun's Many and Many A Year Ago, I had to read more by him.  _The Sultan of Byzantium_ is an entertaining read, but it is difficult to classify: it is part mystery, part travelougue, part historical fiction.  As a result, it almost certainly isn't to every taste.  For those familar with (or fans of) Byzantine history or those who have visited Istanbul, there is much to like here.  For others, it may be a struggle.The premise of the book is a newly minted professor is told that he is the decendent of the last Byzantine Emperor, Constantine XII; in order to claim his birthright he must pass a series of tests, after which he must fulfill the last wishes of his long, lost relative before wealth beyond imagining are his.  And thus begins a series of mysterious tests and challenges as the intrepid hero criss-crosses the old Byzantine empire.Along the way we are treated to a first-person narrative of late Byzantine history, several brief expositons on the various sites visited, allusions and references to Turkish poets, and infrequent run-ins with Selcuk Altun.  I found all of this charming, termendously entertaining and terribly interesting - I suspect that some may find it at best silly and at worst self-indulgent.The resolution to the mystery (or rather, the mysterious nature of the conflict) was wholly unexpected, but very much in keeping with the almost surreal nature of the book.  I recommend it, but with reservation - give Altun a good 50 pages before you make up your mind whether you like him or not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QFCGP6K9YHOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1846591481#wasThisHelpful","R2QFCGP6K9YHOO","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mauricio De Giovanni 's _Commissario Ricciardi_ mysteries are both beautifully written and unique to the genre.  Set in 1930s Naples, the Commisario is haunted by his ability to see the last thoughts of those who died violent deaths.  Ironically, this ability has made him one of the best homicide detectives in the city, while also privately torturing him._Viper_ opens with the brutal murder of a prostitute, reknown in Naples for her beauty, her last thoughts, ""Little whip, little whip, my little whip.""  To what - or whom - this refers is at the root of the mystery.  In spite of the victim's profession, there was no clear motive for her death - she saw only a few clients, and they simply adored her.  The resollution to the crime caught me off guard - and I tend to be clever in resolving mysteries.In addition to putting together a thumping good read, De Giovanni is also a master at writing subplots - in this case not only with Commissario Ricciardi and his complicated relations with two very different women competing for his attention, but also with the larger social and political climate of fascist Italy.  As if this were not enough to recommend this writer, his skill as his craft is lyrical - in particular I love the way in which De Giovanni uses running imagery in telling his story, taking a thought or image from one character and connecting it to another:""She smiled at the girl, and decided that Benedetta was wonderful.Wonderful, thought Enrica, as she looked at the pastiera that she would take to Ricciarid's home tomorrow, for their first dinner together.Wonderful.Wonderful, Livia thought to her suprise, savoring the last bite of the slice of pie that her housekeeper had given her.  This is the best pie I've ever tasted. ...""If you have not yet discovered De Giovanni, you are in for a rare treat.  If you have read the previous books by the author, this is no exception, and is hightly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI9S4VNXHU7YT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609452518#wasThisHelpful","RI9S4VNXHU7YT","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The remainder of the book's short stories (all of which are around 40 pages) are typical Chandler - the snappy dialogue, the quick violence and endings in which the law doesn't always win, but in which the bad guy always gets what coming to him.  My favorites are ""The King in Yellow_""(if one can forgive the racial attitudes and termonology of 80 years ago) about the murder of a jazz musician and ""Pearls Are a Nusiance"" about a private investigator attemtping to recover some stolen jewelry.  None of the stories feature Philip Marlowe, although I believe (and I may be mistaken) that the detective in ""Smart Alec Kill"" - named Mallory - is the prototype for Marlowe.For those unfamiliar with Chandler's work, I recommend The Long Goodbye or The Big Sleep (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard).  For fans of his work, this is a must-have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28S4N5RKCFINS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0394757653#wasThisHelpful","R28S4N5RKCFINS","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a fan of the Mamur Zapt mysteries, but _The Bride Box_ fell short in many ways from the themes, ideas and perspectives that have made the series so endearing and fun to read.  Set in Upper Egypt, the plot revolves around the body of a young woman discovered in her bride box - her trousseau as it were.  While on business in Upper Egypt, the mamur Zapt was dragged into what would othewise have been a minor (or ignored) crime, given that the vicitm was the daughter of a fellahin.The wry observations of Egypitan culture and life, the complex political and economic dance between the British ""occupiers"" (Egypt was a colony in all but name) and the native Egyptians was alluded to, but didn't have the depth that is so endearing in the previous mysteries.  The tragedy of the murder - made all the more so given her station and lot in life - was more the focus here, perhaps as Pearce shows readers another side of Egypt (that outside the hustle and bustle of cosmopolitan Cairo).  It resolution somewhat predictable, but enjoyable as justice was given its due in the end.While I am pleased to see the return of the Mamur Zapt, in comparison to the other stories in the series, this one falls more towards the middle, hence my mediocre review.  If you are new to the series, it is worth your attention, and even though I was less enamoured of this than the others, Pearce's eye for detail and his vivid sense of time and place always make for entertainint reading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNPSICBDE6ZXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0727883038#wasThisHelpful","RNPSICBDE6ZXL","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Watterson does an outstanding job of exploring the role and place of women in ancient Egyptian society.  As in any discussion of women's history, the topics one would expect are discussed here: the social and legal statu of women, marriage,  contributions to the economy (both in and outside of the home.)  But Watterson goes further, looking at fashion, dress and adornment, relationships and courting, women's health and childbirth, and a brief discussion of female pharohs.Drawing from a variety of sources - tomb art and ostraca (naturally), Watterson also makes inferences from sociological research and literature, which not only gives a broader context for her inferences, but also makes connects the ancient world to the modern one.This, along with Women in Ancient Egypt give a well-rounded idea of not only ancient Egyptian society in general, but of women in particular.

"I'm a big fan of Marucio De Giovanni's noir fiction.  His Commsiario Ricciardi mysteries (I Will Have Vengeance (Commisarrio Ricciardi Book 1), Blood Curse: The Springtime of Commissario Ricciardi (Commisarrio Ricciardi Book 2)) are exceptional.  I was therefore thrilled to see that he has written mysteries set in contemporary Naples._The Crocodile_ is quite a bit different from the Ricciradi mysteries - here there is less of the supernatural and more of the mundane, diffiuclt police work.  The story revolves around a series of apparently unrelated victims (each killed in a different part of the city, each from a different social class), but each murdered in a similar way: shot in the back of the head by a small caliber firearm.  The murderer has been given the moniker ""the Crocodile"" by the press, as tissues are left at the murder scene with the remnant of tears on them.  The nickname is apt, as the killer is cold-blooded and meticulous.  Much of the story revolves around finding the method and connection between victims.  It is a brutal and disturbing story whose end leaves you feeling like you've been rabbit-punched to the solar plexus.For those familiar with his earlier work, there are some broad similarities in style: a lone, outcast detective, competing female interests, changing points of view between victims, murderer and investigator.  But _The Crocodile_ has a very different tone to the Ricciaridi mysteries, and the last 40 pages will have readers glued to the page holding their breath.  De Giovanni leaves a number of clues throughout the book for close readers, but putting them together to create a coherent solution is not easy; this is the result of exceptional writing and makes for great read.Fans of Hammet, Chandler and Richard Stark will find much to appreciate here.  The conclusion is unsettling, but it is a highly recommended read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GVWVEUBB75X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609451198#wasThisHelpful","R1GVWVEUBB75X","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alexander Lee's _the Ugly Renaissance_ is really three shorter books threaded together.  The first begins with a discussion of Michaelangelo's early career: his rough-and tumble childhood and a fist-fight that ""almost tore off the cartelidge from his nose.""  The brutality the young Michaelangelo experienced is a metaphor for the time - life was cheap and brutal.  It also serves to give a more personal understanding of the place Renaissance artists stood at the time.The second section was, for me, the most interesting as Lee explores the brutal, dog-eat-dog politics of Renaissance Italy.  Here he discusses how several masterpieces were created to either (a) aggrandize nefarious rulers, bankers or clergy or (b) legitimize the station of these people who, more often than not, gained their status through cheating, lying, murder or any combination of the three.  The final section discusses the Renaissance Church's role as patrons of the arts.  The excesses and lascivious behaviors of Renaissance Popes and cardinals is well-trod ground, but it makes for fun reading nonetheless.The detail Lee provides - both historical and artistic (there are 39 color plates) is excellent; his analysis, critique and connections between art and history is fascinating and well construed.  But because the topic is such well-trod ground, I had hoped for something new in his treatment of the topic.  For arm-chair historians or those visiting Itay (or wanting to), this would make for entertaining - and enlightening - reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZD5TYWTT37RC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536593#wasThisHelpful","RZD5TYWTT37RC","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have strong feelings about Grossman's _The Magicians_ that are diametically opposed.  There is much I enjoyed about the story - in many respects is part homage part parody of ""magical fantasy"" stories of the Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7) and Chronicles of Narnia Box Set - poking fun the types of characters these authors write, and the universes they live in and parodying the obstacles and issues they faced.  Simultaneously I couldn't help but think that there was a snyde mean-streak in his parody, that it was not meant in good humor, and that his protagonist was an obnoxious, self-centered brat cut from the same cloth as Holden Caulfield in  The Catcher in the Rye.To the first reaction, the paralells to the Harry Potter franchise are plenty - from a school for wizardry to the styles and personalities of the faculty to the progression of developing magical abilities (and the inevitable sorting into Grossman's version of ""houses"" based on one's strengths with magic.)  The repeated references to a series of books set in ""Fillory"" involving a set of English siblings is unmistakably an allusion to Lewis' Narnia.  How and where Grossman turns these beloved stories on their heads was more than once a source of a chuckle - from the difficulty of mastering and using magic (as opposed to the relative ease in other books) to the reality of Fillory as not quite the wonderful, magical place portrayed in the series (and as imagined by the characters) made _The Magicians_ seem a little more ""grown-up"" and believable (as paradoxical as that may be.)However, there is an edge to Grossman's humor, almost to the point of a sneer at the interrelationships between the archetypcal characters that ruins the fun after awhile.  The protagonist, Quentin, has few redeeming qualities and only becomes more annoying and bratty as the story unfolds: his sense of entitlement, while initially grating, becomes almost unbearable by the end of the book; the resolution of the conflict (or the end of the quest, if you will) felt like Grossman ran out of ideas and had to quickly wrap things up, before writing an afterword in order to set things in motion for the next book in the trilogy.And therefore I am torn in my reaction to (and evaluation of) the book.  The negative (1 and 2 star) reviews largely make excellent points with which I agree as to why this is a poor story and should be avoided.  Yet the favorable and enthusiastic reviews, too, make a solid case to the merits of the story and writing.  Without doubt Grossman has written a clever story incorporating many elements that are iconic (or perhaps cliched) in the ""magical fantasy"" genre.  Frustratingly, I cannot determine whether it is homage or caricature.  I suspect that you will either love it or hate it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZMVR82NBBJJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0452296293#wasThisHelpful","R1ZMVR82NBBJJ4","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not sure how or where I was introduced to Selcuk Altun, but I am so happy I was.  While _Many and Many a Year Ago_ was a little difficult to get into (the story is a bit circuitous), the rewards for staying with the first 30 pages of the story pay off immeasurably.After a metoric rise in the Turkish airforce as a fighter pilot (and an equally fall), Kemal's fortunes take an unusual turn: an acquaintance of his during his military service has mysteriously disappeared, leaving Kemal an apartment and stipend.  The twin brother of Kemal's friend sets in motion a journey of discovery: of lost loves, of the missing twin, and of the mysterious connection of events in the book with the works of Edgar Allen Poe.The story is stylistically reminiscent of The Shadow of the Wind - both are beautifully written with a powerful emotional punch at the end of the story.

"I like Michael Pearce's writing - both his Mamur Zapt series (The Mamur Zapt & the Return of the Carpet: A Mamur Zapt Mystery (Mamur Zapt Mysteries)) and his Sandor Seymour books Our Man in Trieste.  However, _The Face in the Cemetery_ is not his best work.Set in Egypt at the start of World War I, the mystery is centered around a woman's body found in an excavation of an ancient cemetery - her body wrapped in linen and laid among the ancient mumified remains of cats.  It is soon discovered that the deceased was a German national, complicating matters as Germans at this time were being rounded up and interned out of fears that they were spies.  On a related note, the Mamur Zapt (an old Ottoman position roughly equivalent to ""Head of the Secret Police"" - now held by a Brit since Egypt's virtual occupation by the English) must also trackdown several hundered missing rilfes which could be used to arm local Egyptians and help them end the British occupation.As is typical with Pearce's books in this series, the mystery takes a back seat to his description and details of Egyptian life and snapshots of the time.  However, in this installment, even these typically strong elements are thin and lackluster.  The resolution to the murder (and the missing rifles) is mildly disappointing as well - certainly not of the caliber of his earlier work.While I remain a fan and will read the rest of his work, this isn't the best of the lot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK8KB85IJNIEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008OB6ERK#wasThisHelpful","RK8KB85IJNIEW","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maurizio de Giovanni's Commissario Ricciardi novels are beautifully written, huantingly tragic and first-rate mysteries.  I cannot recommend the series highly enough.  His third book, _Everyone in Their Place_ is (so far), the most lyrical and tightly written of the three.The murder victim is seen as either a gold-digger or a real-life Cinderella - that she did not remain in her place and was perhaps murdered for it (hence the title) is the heart of the story.  But as with all of De Giovanni's stories, there is so much more going on in the story than the mere murder to be solved.  Throughout the story (and involving the Commissario) are a number of star-crossed lovers in an almost Shakesperian dance of miscues, misunderstandings and missed opportunities - the subplot of love, and jealousy (including but not limited to the murder being investigated) make for delicious, compelling and delightful reading.These elements aside, I particularly enjoyed the way in which De Giovanni  shifts perspective from character to character, each tied together with a common thread - an action, a thought or an emotion.  If you are not familiar with this author or his previous books, you owe it to youself to read them - even if mysteries are not your preferred genre such is the skill and beauty of the writing.  For those who enjoy a good puzzle - and especially those who have read the previous novels featuring Commissario Ricciardi - you will not be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HLCI9B0Z4RPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609451430#wasThisHelpful","R3HLCI9B0Z4RPZ","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wolfram's _A HIstory of the Goths_ is a scholarly treatise, and is written for an academic audience, and therefore may not be to everyone's tastes.  That said, it is detailed, exhaustively cited, incisive and with a suprizingly easy to read narrative.As a group, the Goths are a difficult group to pin down - while much as been written about them by others, there are few extant primary sources by the Goths themselves, matters further compounded by their arrival in historical accounts as the Roman empire was disintegrating leaving historians using whatever non-written tools they have at their disposal: archeological finds, lingustics, and anthropological infrences.  In spite of this, Wolfram does a tremendous job of drawing from these resources to create a cohesive history.For the non-academic interested in this ellusive group I recommend [[ASIN:0631165363 The Goths] - this would also be a more accessable introduction to these people.  For a more detailed and in-depth history, however, this is the book I recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HTNG9PTCG9QY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0520069838#wasThisHelpful","R1HTNG9PTCG9QY","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago I saw the film The Color Purple, but until now I had not read the book.  As is so often the case, the imagery and power of the narrative far outshines even the best adaptations.  Alice Walker's _The Color Purple_ is no exception.Written as a series of letters - first to God, later to her sister, the book chronicles the life and experiences of Celie - a mousey, quite and at first glance wholly unremarable woman whose life is marred by sexual, physical and mental abuse.  She is initially an object of pity by the reader and of scorn by others.  Gradually, however, she finds her inner beauty, her voice and her strength.  The breadth of the story arc and the ways in which Celie changes herself (and the ways in which others around her change) literally moved me to tears as I read the final pages of the book.  It is that powerful and that good.Walker's ability to show our common humaness, transcending gender, sexual orientation, race, even social class is profound.  That we all have the ability within ourselves to recreate, reinvent and reclaim our lives in spite of how others define us (or how we define ourselves) is uplifting and empowering.  It is a rare and beautiful story that can do this, and for this reason I give it an enthusiasitc five stars.As if this is not enough to highly recommend this novel, Walker's epistles capture the voice and rhythms of African-American vernacular (much in the same way that Zora Neale Hurston does in Their Eyes Were Watching God - and in fact, Walker explicity addresses the issue of ""talking proper"" later in the book, another aspect of the way in which we define others (and in which others define and categorize us.)If you have only seen the film (and in my case, it was years and years ago), you owe it to yourself to read the book - there is so much nuance, texture and beauty in Walker's words that the film simply cannot capture.  If the title is new to you, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  The accolades it has received are all well-deserved.  It has become one of my top five books of all time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TL2HV5RN2POW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0156028352#wasThisHelpful","R1TL2HV5RN2POW","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While Alexander was arguably one of the greatest generals of all time, the impact of his conquests was largely the result of the diadochi - his ""successors"", who divided up his monumental conquests into their own fiefdoms.  How this mitosis took place, the intrigue, back-stabbing, plotting and fratricidal warfare is the basis of _Ghost on the Throne_.  Romm does a tremendous job of writing the history of the period, the events reading more like fiction than the scholarhip it is given the reversals of forutune, the deceit, trechery and the high stakes of which  the successors were competing.Not only was power and wealth the object of these wars, but also the issue of legitimacy: those with the strongest claims (Alexander's son Alexander IV - a child, Alexander the Great's wife, his dim-witted half brother Philip), were either the objects of manipulation or were active in the manipulation of others.  Added to this were the former generals of Alexander's army who held the real power at the end of a spear, and Alexander's own policies of command and you have the elements that make this event in history so compelling.  As Romm writes, ""Alexander  had ...nurtured in his staff an endless appetite for command and conquest ... The ... bodyguards never ceased to build power, enlarge armies and undermine rivals on the model of their master.  Ptolemy seized North Africa, Lysismachus Thrace; Peithon made a try for Bactria and failed ... Peucestas was enlarging power and popularity in his satrapy, Persis.  Leonnatus and Perdiccas had been killed in attempts to gain, or preserve control of the entire empire.  Craterus, whose status equalled theirs, died trying to deprive Perdiccas of that control ...""I do have one minor issues with the book - the first is that Romm concludes the book with the murder of Alexander's immeadiate family, and does not go into detail about the subsequent conflict between the remaining rivals and the wars for stability that continued for another 20 years.  This, of course, ccan be forgiven as the author has to choose a place to end the historical narrative and this is as good as any.We often foget that Greece is a part of the Balkans - a region reknown for its tendency to break into hostile, competing groups, often to the detriument of the region.  Romm clearly shows this in a riveting history that in many ways is reminiscent of A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1) than of acutal historical events.  That Romm is able to do so is testament to his skill as a writer and as a historian.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ZHHHXC3X0NI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KPM1BW#wasThisHelpful","R14ZHHHXC3X0NI","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In _A Cold Touch of Ice_, Pearce's Mamur Zapt runs into a myriad of famlus Arabists: T.E. Lawrence (""Lawrance of Arabia""), Sir Frederick Kitchener, Gertrude Bell (and a handful of lesser-known figures), in a manner that is somewhat reminiscent of George MacDonald Frasier's  [[ASIN:0452259614 Flashman: A Novel].  All converge on Egypt on the eve of the Balkan Wars (and at the start of the Italo-Turkish War of 1911 - 1912).  The Sick Man of Europe is beginning to die by inches, and the Great Powers of Europe are alternately trying to maintain the balance of power or seize what bits and pieces they can.  All of which puts the Mamur Zapt, serving two masters, in a considerable quandry.Here there are two related stories: weapons are being smuggled through Egypt to assist the Turks in their war (much to the chagrin of the English); simultaneously, a long time European resident of the Nahhasin (then a working-class neighborhood in Cairo) is murdered - perhaps the result of his participation in the smuggling, or perhaps simply because the victim was European, and tensions are rising.  Amidst international intrigue, the Mamur Zapt must keep a lid on simmering tensions within British-controlled (but ostensibly still Ottoman) Egypt.  As Pearce describes it, ""Cairo was still, underneath, not far removed from a tribal society, on in which the honour code had played a crucial part.  And where honour was important, so, too, was shame, in a some way the ultimate social convention of such a society.""The interplay of rural versus urban society (clearly and beautifully illustrated in [[ASIN:0446393924 A History of the Arab Peoples]] is underscored here - the climax and resolution to the murder mystery (and the international plot) reminiscent of the operas that is often referenced in the series.While the books in the series vary in quality, I really enjoyed _A Cold Touch of Ice_.

"The T'ang dynasty in China (618 - 907) is generally considered China's ""golden age"" - it was cosmopolitan, urban (and urbane), and was a veritable melting pot of foreign culture from throughout Asia and east Africa.  Robert Van Gulik has written a number of mysteries set in this time featuring the very real bureaucrat-scholar Judge Dee.  In _Judge Dee at Work_ readers are treated to 8 short stories, each unique in the style of murder and their resolution.  My favorites were ""The Wrong Sword"", in which a traveling circus performer is killed by a real sword (rather than an identical weapon with a retractable blade), and ""He Came With the Rain"" - a mystery whose solution is dependent on an understanding of Chinese folklore.  (Van Gulik helps readers out here, which was appreciated - and which made the story all the more delicious.)Unusual for the mystery genre, the stories provide both a cultural and historical flavor that I enjoy, as well as being quick to read through: given the hectic pace of life, each story is around 20 pages, so the book can be picked up and put down frequently without having to be reminded of clues, characters or red herrings.  For those new to the author, this would be a good place to start; for those already familar with Van Gulik (or Judge Dee), this collection is a real treat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X5X46E4BHD05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226848663#wasThisHelpful","R1X5X46E4BHD05","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Pearce's Mamur Zapt mysteries are fun reading.  Set in turn of the last century Egypt, they are as much historical fiction as they are mystery, and while both can become a bit formulaic as one reads through the series, the insights and descriptions of Egyptian life are why I keep coming back.  In _The Night of the Dog_, a Coptic burial has been descrated (a dog, considered an unclean animal and universally reviled in the Near East, was laid in a tomb) and religious tensions between Muslims and Copts rise, threatening the tenuous rule of the Khedive and potentially wreaking havoc on British rule in Egypt.  Enter the Mamur Zapt - a sort of chief of political police.The mystery is solid,if a bit difficult to resolve given the complicated nature of Egyptian society and the finances of the Khedive (which brought the British to Egypt in the first place). The interplay of religion as an excuse for power (then, as now in the region) was brilliantly shown, however.  That unscrupulous people use religion to motivate and instigate people to action is not new; Pearce highlights this and the hypocracy of those who use religion in this manner marvellously.The series is light, the mysteries themselves fun and entertaining, for which I typically give 3 or 4 stars.  The author's eye for detail and his understanding of culture, religion and society is what earns this book 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XR3WSX6Y6CJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590580257#wasThisHelpful","R1XR3WSX6Y6CJJ","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I learned much about leadership as a combat medic in the Marine Corps; contrary to popular imagining, good leadership is not done by yelling or fear (see No Yelling: The 9 Secrets of Marine Corps Leadership You Must Know to Win in Business) or, as Machiavelli put it, ""being both feared and loved"", but rather by clear communication and team building - what the Marine Corps referred to as ""esprit de corps"".  I was therefore a bit skeptical when, as part of a management class I was asked to read from _The 8 Dimensions of Leadership_, not only out of contempt for ""self-help"" books in general, but also a belief that I had a pretty good idea of what leadership is.Sugerman, Scullard and Wilhelm's book is very different from what I had anticipated, and I was doubly pleased that the information here was both insightful and useful.  By answering a series of questions about how one responds to different situations, people and obstacles (reminiscent in many ways to a Briggs-Meyers), readers are then identified as one of 8 types of leaders: pioneering, energizing, affirming, inclusive, humble, deliberate, resolute, or commanding.  Each style of leadership has its strengths (which are discussed), but so too do each of these styles present unique challenges to completing the team goal.  From this, readers are directed to specific chapters where lessons to improve your leadership style are addressed.  In short, the book helps you beocme a better leader by highlighting what works and by suggesting approaches and changes to improve communication, build group cohesion, identify and articulate clear goals, and inspiring and developing talent working for you.For those entering a leaderhip role - in business, academia, or politics - I strongly recommend this book.  It is easy to read (in a few hours of a weekend afternoon I was able to read and digest what was relevant to me), clear, speciic and individualized.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVI4Z0KLYIBIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605099554#wasThisHelpful","RVI4Z0KLYIBIK","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Micahel Pearce's Mamur Zapt mysteries are light, fun period piece mysteries set in Edwardian Cairo, involving British army captain Gareth Owen as the Mamur Zapt - a sort of chief of poliitcal police.  The last cut the title refers to is the annual cut made in the banks of the NIle at the peak of the innundation allowing for irrigation.  At the start of the 20th century, water lines were put in, making the practice obselete (hence the ""last cut"".)  The plot is convoluted, as various groups either suport or resent the new water lines, compounded by factions competing for who will have the honor (and be paid) to make the cut.  The Mamur Zapt gets involved when a young girl is found dead in the dry canal bed just days before the innundation.The investigation of who the murderer is and what the motives behind the killing goes around and around and around in a circle, frustratingly so.  ANcillary mysteries around sabotage of the canal and the water lines add to the convoluted nature of the story.  Frankly, things could have been wrapped up in a thrid of the length it took Pearce to resolve it.Even though I found _The Last Cut_ a bit of a dud, the series itself is entertaining.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F1439AJ86JOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590581768#wasThisHelpful","R2F1439AJ86JOI","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I assume and suspect that at this point you are familiar with both author and character; if not, I recommend both.  That said, by the 14th book in any lengthy series (and usually well before then), most authors hit a stale patch - what new windmills do the characters have to tilt towards?  How much more can the character grow?  What new directions can the story be taken?  Jim Butcher solves these problems by simply killing Harry Dresden.  (His world of magic and the supernatural - and there being as of this writing, two more installments of the Dresden Files, its safe to say that at some point and time this setback is addressed.)The plot device works, and provides new material - it is refreshing to see Dresden as a helpless noob, out of his element, powerless, on unfamiliar ground with new rules and still subject to the supernatural dangers and brand-new threats that he neither understands nor has the ability to combat.  However, given Dresden's ghostly status, the story is bitter-sweet, his friends, allies and colleagues moruning his passing even as an old foe threatens both them and Chicago, Dresden almost helpless to assist.Levity is provided through its numerous references to earlier stories (_Side Jobs_, _Dead Beat_, _Fool Moon_, _Changes_) and literally dozens of pop culture allusions, although many will be missed by those born after 1979 (The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension, Pink Floyd: The Wall, Justice League: Season 1 (DC Comics Classic Collection), Big Trouble In Little China [HD], Pee-Wee's Big Adventure) but still with many, many others that are a part of late 20th century canon (Star Wars Trilogy Episodes IV-VI (Blu-ray + DVD), Star Trek: The Motion Picture [HD], X-Men, The Princess Bride, J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings (Movie Tie-in): The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King)  Butcher keeps these coming fast and furious, undercutting the seriousness and tragedy of the story.In many respects, _Ghost Story_ is also an homage to Chicago, not only through references to geographical landmarks and the personalities who shaped and made the city, but also Dresden's role the last 13 books  as the city's protector and warden.  Were it not for the subsequent installments in the series, readers could be forgiven for thinking the Dresden files were being closed.  Fortunately for fans, this is not the case even as Butcher gives a poignant, at times tear-jerking but always highly entertaining story that provides new opportunities for other characters to develop while providing new perspective and dimension to a popular hero.  _Ghost Story_ is one of Butcher's best in spite of the dangers and concerns that stories this far in a series become old and spent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DPR0V9DL9PS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451464079#wasThisHelpful","R1DPR0V9DL9PS7","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"_Oranges_ is a flawed book for several reasons.  The greatest issues I have is that it really doens't seem to have a clear focus.  The opening chapter ""Oranges"" is about the fruit itself: where it originated, how its spread parallels ancient trade routs and conquests from Asia to Andalusia (and subsequently the New World), varities of the fruit and they varied ways in which it is enjoyed.  ""Indian River"" similarly discusses both the growth of the fruit in Florida and the horticulture (pommeculture, would be more specific) behind the fruit.  These were the strongest and most interesting chapters in the book.In between and after these chapters, McPhee focuses on the orange industry, on orange barons, and on concentrated frozen OJ versus fresh orange juice.  (It seems we consumers perfer consistency, hence the prevalance of one and the scarcity of the other - oranges vary not only in terms of variety, but even where on the tree they grow and the region in which the tree lives much like wine.)  While some of this is interesting, there is a real lack of consistent focus as McPhee jumps from one aspect of the topic to another, each not well or clearly connected to the previous point discussed.  Even within chapters, McPhee has a lack of focus, one moment zeroing in on details fo Florida citrus verus California citrus before disussing the different ways in which the fruit is harvested in one state as opposed to another.Stronger editing or clearer transitions and tighter organization would have gone far to improve what is otherwise a scattered material, making it a more coherent narrative.  As it stands, it is the sort of book you dip in and out of, or simply skim through, which is a disappointment as the subject matter is interesting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUIQEHB047PRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374512973#wasThisHelpful","RUIQEHB047PRQ","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Pearce's ""Mamur Zapt"" mysteries are clever and fun on several levels, the greatest of which is the sense of place and time as he describes Cairo (and the Arabic world).  _The Mingrellian Conspiracy_ is one of his best - so much so, that it could be read outside of the series' chronology.  (Pearce does a great job of explaining who - or rather what - the Mamur Zapt is,(a sort of Chief of Political Police, Gareth Owen, a captain in the British Army in this case) and just how the English came to control Egypt at the turn of the last century in the opening pages.)  Unlike many of the other stories in the series, this is less a mystery focused on crime than an outright political thriller.In 1908, Cairo (like the Ottoman Empire), is a mishmash of ethnic and religious minorities from around the Levan and Balkans.  As Pearce describes it, ""(a) city of sixty nationalities, most of whom were always at each other's throats, one hundred and twelve different ethinc groups, ditto, two hundred plus sects of a variety of religions, even more ditto, and growing Egyptian nationalism.  Not to mention the fact that there was not one but three legal systems, each with its own courts, among which agile criminals sould slip with eternal impunity.""  To add to the mix, the Mamur Zapt must also contend with the over-zealous British Army and its know-it-all officers.The plot revolves around a plot to assassinate the visiting Russian Grand Duke, the ramifications of which could drage Britain (and the rest of Europe) into a war - much like the later real-life assassination of Archduke Ferdninand would touch off the First World War.  The story is fast-paced, light and often times humorous (as Cpt. Owen navigatges both issues of gender as well as those of politics, and as Pearce has light-hearted fun with the Welsh, Owen's homeland.)While I recommend the series, (The Mamur Zapt & the Return of the Carpet: A Mamur Zapt Mystery (Mamur Zapt Mysteries)) I strongly recommend this book in particular as an example of Pearce's work and as a sample of his characters, setting and style.  As an aside, I also enjoyed Pearce's other criminal mysteries featuring Sandor Seymour, an East-end detective  Dead Man in Trieste (A Dead Man in).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30CDGZQTWEJFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590581776#wasThisHelpful","R30CDGZQTWEJFH","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Samuel Cohen is a professor of Medieval History, his book written for academic audiences (or the serious armchair historian).  In _The Black Death Transformed_, Cohen reconsidered whether the 'Great Mortality' of 1348 - 1351 was indeed Yersina pestis - the bubonic plague.  Contrary to most contemporary historians (Plagues and Peoples, Disease and History, The Black Death: Natural and Human Disaster in Medieval Europe, The Black Death: A Chronicle of the Plague, Black Death, In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World It Made), Cohen argues that the disease that struck Western Europe in the 14th century (and remained in successive waves of epidemic outbreak into the 18th century) couldn't have been Y. pestis.Cohen's argument rests on several claims:1) the medieval plague's pattern of infection was fundamentally different from modern outbreaks, ""recurring year after year with mounting and then erratic ups and downs in mortality before declining.""2) the symptoms described in primary sources from the 1340s (black blisters and spots occuring all over the body; buboes under the armpits and under the jaw) do not match well with symptoms of modern plague3) physical complaints of the afflicted in the medieval outbreak (odd stench, stiffness in the joints, severe headaches, spitting of vomiting of blood) are very different from those of the modern bubonic plague4) the vector for bubonic plague is through flea bites.  Most flea bites occur below the knee, the nearest lymph nodes to be affected, therefore are in the groin - how, Cohen asks, would the disease have spread to the armpits or neck?5) The areas of the city where most rats would congreate would be near grainaries (an abundant food source).  Yet in examining the locations of where the outbreak of the plague took place, the epicenters of disease are not near the grainaries, but in the poorer parts of town.6) the assertion that the bubonnic plague became pneumonic is also challenged, Coehn arguing that pneumonic plague is virtually unheard of in moden (since 1894) outbreaks of the bubonic plague, and that it is not as virulent as that transmitted by fleas7) in comparing the mortality across Europe, there is a seasonal variation that is in congruent with fleas (and their hosts, rats): in the Mediterranean the greatest mortality took place in the hot, dry summer months, while in northern Europe they took place in the cooler, wetter autumn.\8) Cohen also demolishes the long-held belief that the plague was brought west via Central Asian merchants, the fleas living in bundles of wool; wool, Cohen claims, is not a suitable host for fleas, and therefore cannot be the way in which the disease was introduced to Europe.While his reconsideration of what has been long-considered canon is controversial, he makes a strong case.  Each of his points are meticulously cited and researched from sources acrross Europe.  His analysis of this evidence is carefully considered and convincingly argued.  Even when there may be evidence to the contrary (as in the findings by paleomicrobiologists in 2000 that DNA taken from the tooth pulp of plague corpses in Montpelier that it was indeed Y. pestis) is brought up, ever the scholar, Cohen rightly calls for corroboration from other grave sites.  What troubles me wasn't his challenge to what has long been accepted as historical and epidemiological fact , but the lack of a plausable alternative to Y. pestis, and the consideration that perhaps modern Y. pesitis may have evolved in the 600-plus years since the 14th century.As Cohen writes in his conclusion, ""... I contend that the unquestioned orthodoxy that the late-medieval plagues had to have been modern bubonic plague is not only wrong, it has retarded our knowledge of both the disease and its social and cultural consequences.""  Even though nothing has been contributed to address what caused the Great Mortality if not Y. pestis, his scholarship is honest and first-rate, and the questions he raises (and his role as historical iconoclast) warrant attention.  An excellent history and a brilliantly argued reconsideration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBKP1BHDCPBNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0340706473#wasThisHelpful","RBKP1BHDCPBNS","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years ago I read The Shape of Water (Inspector Montalbano, Book 1), and was disappointed.  Based on that experience, I had reservations about reading another murder mystery set in southern Italy.  I was wrong.  _I Will Have Vengance_ is brilliantly written.  It is a tragic and lyric mystery, with an emotional punch to the solar plexus at its conclusion.  Like the opera that plays such a crucial role in the unfolding of the story, it is evocative, stunning and an emotional rollercoaster.  I am thrilled that I stumbled across it, and am looking forward to the next story by De Giovanni.Set in Naples in the early 1930s, Arnaldo Vezzi, a primadonna tenor, is found murdered in his dressing room.  Commissario Ricciardi is summoned to solve the case.  Vezzi was a talented artist, a ""god among tenors"", with connection to Il Duce himself - there is political pressure from on high to quickly solve the case.  In his investigation, Ricciardi discovers that in addition to being a a world-class talent, the deceased was also a world-class monster: abusive of those around him, arrogant, self-centered.  There was no end to those who hated him; ironically, those same suspects relied on his talents to make their living (as agents, stage managers, cast and crew.)But Commissario Ricciardi has a secret of his own: he sees and hears the last thoughts of the recently deceased.  They haunt his every movement, be it while he has an espresso (a child run over by the tram stands in front of the window, her mangled body clutching a rag doll saying, ""This is my daughter.  I bathe her every day"") or a mafioso whose throat was cut, laughing at the young man who threatened him with a knife.  In the dressing room, Ricciardi sees the final moments of the tenor as he sings ""Io sangre voglio, all'ira m'abbandondo, in odio tutto 'amor mio fini"" (I will have vengance, all my love shall end in hate."") - a line from the opera.  Armed with this knowledge and his considerable powers of deduction, De Giovanni takes readers on a fast-paced investigation involving the Church, the opera, and a woman across the alley from Ricciardi's apartment.In addition to a first-rate murder investigation, the writing (and translation) are beautiful.  The tragic images of the dead are hauntingly described, their effects on Commissario Ricciardi profound.  As the Commissario says, ""Believe me when I tell you that damnation is the relentless perception of sorrow, day in and day out.  Other people's sorrow that becomes your own, that stings like a whip, that leaves wounds that won't heal, that go on bleeding, that infect your blood.""  Sorrow - and loss - are themes that permeate the book.  One gets the sense of the awful burden that homicide detectives must bear, shouldering the responsibility to find those who have committed murder, the profound loss felt by the victim's families, and the daily ration of sorrow that is the bread-and-butter of their job.A parallel theme De Giovanni explores here is the motive behind murder.  He writes, ""The same energy that drives humanity can divert it until it becomes infected and festers, then explodes into violence .... hunger and love are the source of all atrocities.""  These twin forces are shown again and again both in the story and on the stage.  It is simply a masterful work that was a joy to read.

"The Camel of Destruction is an Arabic metaphor, similar to the English ""loose cannon"" -an event (or person) that wreaks havoc and destroys all in its path (from the analogy of a camel that becomes untethered and runs amuck tearing down tents, trampling and breaking things.)  In Michael Pearce's imaginings, it is also a fitting image for the financial crisis that precipitated the English occupation of Egypt, finance, banking and urban development the McGuffin of this story.The mystery begins innocuously enough - a mid-level bureaucrat in the Department of Agriculture commits suicide.  Or perhaps, it was murder - which is how the Mamur Zapt (an old Ottoman title for the political police) becomes involved.  What follows is a complex story involving competing economic interests in 1910 Egypt between the Khedive (the titular ruler), the British (the real power in the country), Nationalists, Islamic fundamentalists, and the fellahin (rural peasants).  As with the other Mamur Zapt mysteries (The Mamur Zapt & the Return of the Carpet: A Mamur Zapt Mystery (Mamur Zapt Mysteries), The Mamur Zapt and the Donkey-Vous) the mysteries and their resolution are fun, but the real treat is the descriptions of Egyptian life.  The interplay of traditional gender roles, the legacy of Ottoman (and Mameluke) governance and corruption, the descriptions of the sights, sounds and ""feel"" of the city are wonderful.  For example, Pearce writes,""All Cairo loved a procession, which was just as well for there wre plenty of them.  There were wedding processions, funeral processions; there were processions to mark the end of Ramadan and the Rising of the Waters; there was a procession to 'smell the air', when half of Cairo trooped out of the city on the first day of the khamsin to savour the coming of spring.There were processions to mark saints' days and there was certainly at least one saint's day every week.  There was a porcession to mark the birthday of the Prophet, marred only by the fact that the interfering British would no longer allow devotees to lie on their faces in the street of the Descendant of the Prophet to ride over.  ... The best time fro processions was during the pilgrim season ...""Pearce is a tremendously entertaining writer; and if the mysteries themselves take a back-seat to the scenery, so much the better as an armchair vacation.  A recommened author as well as series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NRMGV4ZUW8BO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590580419#wasThisHelpful","R1NRMGV4ZUW8BO","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Dickinson's Lord Powerscourt mysteries (Goodnight Sweet Prince, Death and The Jubilee) are light, fun mysteries- a perfect summer distraction.  In his twelfth novel, a visiting scholar discovers that the Elgin Marble is a fake (the type and quality of the stone isn't what it should be.)  Given the concurrent heist of the Mona Lisa, the British Museum is anxious to resolve the case as quickly (and quietly) as possible.  Enter Powerscourt.The mystery itself is a veritable labyrinth of clues, dead-ends and possible tragedies (as the title implies.)  Figuring out who is the responsible party in the theft and where the Marble is destined was so complex that I had to stop trying to solve the case in advance of Powerscourt and just let Dickenson take me along for the ride.  This I enjoyed, tremendously - until the final reveal, at which point I felt a bit cheated.  However, this is not why I give the story 4 stars.  One of the charming elements of the series is are the supporting characters - Lady Powerscourt and Lord Powersccourt's hard-drinking friend, Lord Johnny Fitzgearld.  In this installment, they are scarcely mentioned; in fact, red herrings and possible culprits to the crime are given much more attention than either of these characters, to its detriment.The series is delightful, the characters and their interrelationships a real strength to the narrative arc.  That this is given such short attention, in addition to a sleight-of-hand conclusion cost it a star.  That said, Dickinson is a solid writer and for fans of mysteries (or of fin-de-sicle fiction), this is a sure hit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U9RDYH7SB6R1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHK72LC#wasThisHelpful","R1U9RDYH7SB6R1","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those unfamiliar with Jim Butcher's ""Dresden Files"", he has mixed elements of detective noir with the supernatural to create Harry Dresden, Chicago's only professional wizard.  This isn't Harry Potter - think more Philip Marlowe with the ability to use magic.  The series (Storm Front (Dresden Files), Fool Moon: Book two of The Dresden Files) are fun (if light) reading.  In _Side Jobs_, Butcher presents a series of short stories featuring characters from the novels, all the stories set between the longer stories.Some (""A Restoration of Faith"" and ""Aftermath"") have never previously been published - all the stories have a brief preface by Butcher detailing when in the series each story takes place, a bit about why the story was written (or for whom), and what Butcher was thinking when the story was written.  I loved the stories - the story behind the stories was a special treat, as it is so rare that readers get a glimpse behind the curtain.  As with any collection of writing, some stories resonated with me more than others.  ""Herorot"" (taking place between White Night (The Dresden Files, Book 9) and Small Favor (The Dresden Files, Book 10)) - a tale that connected Beowulf to the ancient concept of a ""honeymoon"" with a dash of Valkyrie, was particularly entertaining.  ""Love Hurts"" (set between Turn Coat (The Dresden Files, Book 11) and Changes: A Novel of the Dresden Files) gave readers a glimpse of what a relationship between Dresden and Murphy might be like - a bit syrupy, but a fun distraction.  ""Aftermath"" (two hours after _Changes_ ends) was another winner - a story told exclusively from the perspective of Det. Sgt. Murphy gives one a sense of what lies ahead in the series.Taken as a body, it was also enjoyable to see Butcher's evolution as a writer (""A Restoration of Faith"" was a story written while he was a student at the University of Oklahoma's Professional Writing Program), and to have stories told from the perspectives of others (Harry's half-brother, and Mac all get a chance to show what their lives are like outside of the broader story line.)  For fans of the author, this is an easy sell.  For those unfamiliar with the author or the series, the books are a fun distraction and purely escapist reading in all the best ways.  I recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XKPBX49R0FX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451463846#wasThisHelpful","R2XKPBX49R0FX4","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me begin by saying I am a fan of Hammett specifically, and of noir in general.  The previous Hammett stories I've read The Maltese Falcon, The Thin Man, Red Harvest, The Continental Op) I've all enjoyed - even the Continental Op has grown on me.  However, _The Dain Curse_ is convulted, difficult to follow, and as a previous reviewer noted, akin to a soap opera in the unfolding of the story.The story begins with a diamond burglary, but soon unfolds into a series of murders, Gabrielle Dain, daughter and heiress of the owner of the burgled diamonds at the center of the violence.  As the plot unfolds, the story takes some really odd turns involving alternately a cult involved in human sacrifice, murder camoflauged as accidental death to perhaps cover-up another crime, and morphine addiction.  With so many unlikely events occuring at once, the book at times  had my head swimming.  Perhaps this is why the Continental Op, typically unsentimental and jaded, shows a more gentle and softer side in this story.  For this reason as well as for the convoluted storyline, _The Dain Curse_ is as unlike anything else I've read by Hammett - and it is the worse for it.  Even the snappy dialogue is diluted here.If you are new to Hammett, this is not the book I would recommned reading as an introduction.  For those who have read his other work, this seems to be an anomaly in the canon and is not his best work in my opinion.  That said, even on a bad day, Hammett is a better writer than most, for which I give it a mediocre rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ777VYRT57QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679722602#wasThisHelpful","RZ777VYRT57QS","A2NHD7LUXVGTD3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NHD7LUXVGTD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had never heard of rosehip oil until my sister introduced me to it when she purchased a bottle for herself after claiming that Miranda Kerr swears by it. Not one to ever turn down potentially looking like Miranda Kerr, I began looking into rosehip oil as well in hopes that it would improve my acne-prone skin. I was initially wary of it since I have combination, acne-prone skin that gets oily throughout the day, and knowing that oil is often the cause of my acne, I was hesitant to put even more oil on my already sensitive skin.This rosehip oil was surprisingly not greasy as I expected it to be. It reminds me of tea tree oil, if you have ever used that. The product is far from greasy and is easily absorbent upon application. I have been consistently applying this product to an acne scar on the side of my face, and although it has only been a few days, the scar is noticeably beginning to fade away. Huge upside to this product is that it is a very generous size (4 ounces) for the price, so I can apply it liberally and use it as an all-over serum rather than a spot treatment. It is an incredibly versatile product that can be used as an acne treatment, facial toner, daily moisturizer, scar/blemish treatment, and makeup remover, to name a few. As I mentioned, the generous size of this product allows me to use it liberally and experiment with the countless ways to apply it. Overall, very impressed with this product, its many uses, and its overall effectiveness.Sample provided by Majestic Pure for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2APLX2XTU04YR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QR7FTLU#wasThisHelpful","R2APLX2XTU04YR","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been fortunate enough to test many different power banks ranging from different designs to varying charging capacities, but this is of the best power banks I have tried. In fact, it is the one I use on a daily basis because of its simplicity, functionality, and high capacity charge.Best features of this product:+ Powerful charging capacity. With its 10,000 mAh capacity, I am able to fully charge my iPhone 6 from 0% or 1% approximately 4-5 times with the amount of stored power that this device contains. From 50+%, I can get at least 10 charges from this power bank. For comparison purposes, I have a 3,200 mAh battery case that I can only get 1 1/2 charges out of before it goes dead.+ Not sure what it is about this particular power bank, but whenever I use it to charge a completely dead iPhone, the phone turns on way faster than it would with normal charging via an outlet adapter. Awesome benefit that I didn't expect to have.+ I travel often and am usually in conferences/meetings that last all day, so I love that it only takes about 3 hours to fully charge this power bank to 100%, and I can then use it to exclusively charge my phone for the next couple of days.+ Simple, stylish, and portable. Its not too heavy for its size and capacity, so it is easy to carry around in a purse or backpack. The power bank is sturdy and substantial, and its simple design is sleek and aesthetically appealing.+ Great LCD screen/digital display to clearly indicate exact remaining charging power.Overall, this 10,000 mAh power bank is a high-quality portable charger offering several unique features that helps to give it an edge over its competitors in the highly-competitive power bank market. Highly recommend this product and would give it 10 stars if I could.Sample provided by iPowerBuddy for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFXR8PSEF24DE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QH8DL0U#wasThisHelpful","RFXR8PSEF24DE","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Setavan's stretch mark removal cream works quite well to diminish the appearance of stretch marks. However, keep in mind that it is not an overnight miracle cure, and will therefore take several applications before yielding visible results.Pros:+ Skin is smoother and firmer around my stomach area. The small ""tiger stripes"" have not completely disappeared (as expected - this is not a miracle cream), but the stretch marks are not as obvious as they used to be.+ Helps my scars fade in color and intensity. The white stretch marks on my stomach were very apparent, but after 2 weeks, they are starting to blend in and not be so obvious.+ Light fragrance that is not overwhelming like other stretch mark creams (i.e. Palmer's cocoa butter).+ Easy to apply evenly despite being much thicker than lotion.+ Subtle but visible results after 2 weeks.+ Beautiful, clean packaging that makes it look much more expensive than it actually is.Cons:- Seems to work better as a moisturizer than a cellulite remover. It reminds me of an anti-aging serum that works well to hydrate face but does not immediately attack anti-aging signs. This stretch mark cream has done wonders for my skin in terms of moisturizing and smoothing it, but has not immediately attacked stretch marks the way I would have liked it to. The scars are slowly fading, but I don't know if they will ever completely go away.Overall, this product is great and is of very high quality - it improves, lifts, and firms scarred skin, but I would have liked to see more long-lasting results.Sample provided for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U4I62508FN0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXSKP1U#wasThisHelpful","R2U4I62508FN0Z","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you don't have a black 10-feet length lightning cable in your life, stop everything you are doing and buy one now. The white ones are nice, but get dirty way too quickly. I love that the black cords can better withstand daily wear and tear while still looking new. Take my word for it - once you go 10 feet, you won't go back to anything shorter than that. And once you go black, you won't go back (to a white charging cord, that is).I previously always had to rely on an extension cord in order to comfortably charge my phone while using it in bed. Extension cords are often unreliable and can sometimes stop working out of nowhere, so I began using power banks to charge my phone out of desperation. I figured I might as well try out a 10-feet cable since I was too impatient to wait 2-3 hours for my power banks to charge, so here I am now.This cable is amazing. The 10 feet length can reach across huge rooms and every single friend and family member of mine have asked where they can purchase one. After a mishap with some low-quality ""Apple certified"" lightning cables I purchased online that constantly popped up an error message and stopped working after 2 days, I had been reluctant to buy any chargers that weren't manufactured by Apple itself, but fortunately, this particular charging cord has restored my faith in buying non-Apple/Apple certified products.Best features of this product:- Highly convenient length. At 10 feet long, this is more than 9 times the length of a normal Apple lightning cable. So much easier to work with and use - I can actually use my phone from my bed while it is plugged into the wall without having to use an extension cord.- Black color better withstands daily wear and tear.- Good quality and comparable to Apple. I don't notice any differences in the time it takes to get a full charge.- Durable cable. I've had many Apple chargers become useless from the wire starting to wiggle out of place, but this one has held strong so far.- Most importantly, does not pop up any ""accessory not supported"" messages. This was my biggest concern, but I am thrilled to find that I have not gotten any error messages so far.Overall, a great value for a product that is comparable, if not superior to with its 10 feet length offering, Apple lightning cables.Sample provided for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29U7DKK6JD4UC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPT3CVU#wasThisHelpful","R29U7DKK6JD4UC","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm fortunate enough to have tried many different brands of infuser bottles, but this one stands out as one of my absolute favorites. Infuser bottles all pretty much work the same - you just unscrew the infuser chamber, add whatever fruits or vegetables you want into it, twist it back in, and voila. As a result, I look for three features that typically set apart one infuser bottle from the next according to my personal preferences: 1.) design (color scheme, etc.), 2.) visibility of brand logo (I dislike when the company's logo is branded all over the bottle), and 3.) size of canister holes (some bottles' holes are large enough that pieces of fruit will escape).This particular bottle by Basily meets all of my requirements - the design is simple, the blue color scheme is versatile and unisex, there is virtually no brand logo on the bottle, and the infuser chamber is nicely sized so that pieces of fruit will not escape the canister. Overall, the design and quality are both very impressive - I love that the design is so simple and clean and just allows the functionality to speak for itself. Because there is no brand logo on the product, I typically reach for this bottle more than others because its full transparency, when combined with pretty fruits and vegetables in the middle, is very aesthetically appealing. I always get compliments at work and the gym whenever I use this bottle - water is honestly so much more refreshing and fun to drink when I am using this product. Would definitely recommend to those who are trying to decide between this product and another similar one on the market.Sample provided for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DM73XOXF6GW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STSWSCI#wasThisHelpful","R1DM73XOXF6GW3","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazing purchase at a great price ($8.50 at the time of writing!) I'm a huge beauty junkie so my drawers are filled with products, but I have to say this clay mask is the best one I have tried. This jar is HUGE and substantially heavy, and considering you don't need to use that much each time, this jar is sure to last you months. I look forward to using this each week - it's kind of like a spa getaway within the comforts of my own home.Before using, I clean my face with a Konjac sponge to clear my face of any particles or residue that might prevent the mask from being completely smooth. I mix the product with water from the faucet, apply the mixture to my face once it comes to a good consistency, and leave it on for 20 minutes. The most difficult part about this process in my opinion is cleaning off the mask, only because it can get pretty messy. I usually wipe as much of it off with my hands as I can, then use a washcloth to clean off any remaining parts of the mask.My face always feels incredibly soft and smooth upon cleaning off the mask since this mask helps to exfoliate the dead skin cells and thoroughly clean out pores. Previously, my skincare routine consisted of an exfoliator followed by a mask, but this product has allowed me to combine those two steps into one. I have acne-prone skin and I definitely feel like this has cleaned out my pores to aid in reducing acne breakouts. Love this product and often recommend it when friends ask how I have been managing my acne breakouts.Sample provided for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DBP4GOWLCFTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q96XGUU#wasThisHelpful","R1DBP4GOWLCFTP","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been growing out my eyebrows for a few years now and they have finally taken to their natural shape, but I still have some areas (namely the front ends of my eyebrows) that are more sparse than others. I looked into Latisse to see if their product could help with my eyebrows' hair growth, but its price quickly turned me off. I came across this product - although it is advertised as an eyelash growth product, I found that it works just as well in accelerating hair growth on my eyebrows.It took a while to begin seeing results (at least 3-4 weeks) due to the time it takes for the follicles to stimulate hair growth, but after a month passed, I began noticing significant results. Whereas I previously had to draw and fill in the sparse areas of my eyebrows, those same areas began growing out hairs that would have taken multiple months to do before. For the past few days, I have not felt the need to draw them in, something I have done for years now. Instead, there are enough hairs for it to look natural enough if I just dust some light brown eyeshadow on top for added color and depth. I really hope that this new pattern of increased hair growth continues since my eyebrows are looking fuller and are starting to take on a much more natural appearance than they have before.This particular serum is great because it is much more affordable than Latisse and extensions. It is also incredibly easy to use - the pointed brush operators similarly to liquid eyeliner and allows me to apply it to more specific and localized areas rather than messily heaping it on everywhere. Additionally, I have very sensitive skin that often gets irritated or dried out by new or unfamiliar products, but have not experienced any irritation from this serum. My only critique is that it will take several weeks before seeing results, and some people may not have the patience for that. However, patience pays off with this particular product since I have personally gotten great results (fuller, thicker eyebrow hairs resulting in a more natural-looking appearance) from daily and consistent application over 3-4 weeks.I received a sample of this product for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FER6FK3IWVS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPYYG4C#wasThisHelpful","R3FER6FK3IWVS1","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great product that stands out in both quality and design. It was much easier to install than I expected it to be and was up and running within minutes of taking it out of the box. Very convenient to use and a must-have for bike enthusiasts as it is a well-designed and high-quality product. This light is perfect for bike riders who are looking for an affordable, easy-to-use product that can increase their safety by helping to make them more conspicuous to drivers and pedestrians.There are many bike lights on the market, but the stand out features of this product in comparison to its competitors would be the fact that it is 1) LED, 2) rechargeable, and 3) versatile. I have used bike lights that depended on batteries and therefore were pricey and inconvenient to use, but the fact that this one is rechargeable via USB makes it a winner. I typically charge the light after about 8-10 of my daily rides with my pups, and it usually takes approximately only a couple of hours to fully charge using my iPhone's USB adapter. The LED feature allows the light to be very bright when it is on its highest setting, and I appreciate that I can choose to put it on high, low, or strobe mode. I read that the strobe mode allots for 50 hours of run time, so I sometimes change to that setting when I am too lazy to recharge. Otherwise, the high setting allows for about nine 20-minute rides before having to be charged, which is perfect for my needs. Overall, I would definitely recommend this bike light as it performs well and is overall an excellent product.Sample provided by Blitzu for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O4PU7GJLQGJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YB5GAEA#wasThisHelpful","R3O4PU7GJLQGJF","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The price tag may seem a little hefty for some dog medicine, but this product works and is one of the few forms of glucosamine that my dogs have not turned away. I have two Siberian Husky pups, and unfortunately, their breed is especially susceptible to hip dysplasia. My 2-year-old male pup, Shiloh, is already showing signs of early onset - he slightly limps from what I assume is pain in his back right leg and will lay down after 10 minutes of playing with other dogs or in the middle of walks to avoid putting further pressure on it.Glucosamine in liquid form was previously the only thing he reacted well to, but since purchasing this product, he happily takes his medicine without running under the bed whenever he sees us open the bottle. The beef flavored chews are incredibly easy to use and give to him: we include it with shredded pieces of chicken and he eats up his medicine without any hesitation, a drastic departure from how he acted towards other glucosamine products we had tried.After consistently using this product for a little over 2 weeks, I am already beginning to see improvements with Shiloh's ability to put pressure on his right hind leg. He can climb stairs without stopping, hop onto the bed, and stand on his hind legs to greet me. Most importantly, he is a happy, well-exercised pup again - he can now keep up with other dogs and can go on 30-minute walks without beginning to limp or having to take a break. Overall, a great product that is easy for dogs to consume, is actually effective, and adds at least a couple of years to dogs' health/well-being in only a few weeks.Sample provided by Primed Paws for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OE3B19GPS0KB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XOOJ3RA#wasThisHelpful","R2OE3B19GPS0KB","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very cool tripod stand that is a must-have for those who use their phone as their primary camera. I use my iPhone as a camera for everything, which is great for convenience purposes but has caused me to sacrifice image quality due to my unsteady hands. This tripod stand has helped me get higher-quality images and videos by allowing me to set my phone on a surface without it falling over.Best features of this product:+ Very lightweight yet durable at the same time. I was concerned that my phone would fall over the first couple of times I used this tripod stand, but have quickly discovered that the tripod can actually withstand quite an amount of weight and pressure that exceeds even that of my iPhone 6.+ Very versatile. The head can be adjusted in a 360 direction, and the legs can be bent or positioned according to how the angle and/or height that I want my photographs to be taken at. Probably the neatest feature of this product.+ The metal legs of the tripod are reinforced with foam and rubber, so they don't scratch any surfaces and allow the tripod to stand without potentially slipping or falling.+ Great value for the price. This tripod stand is high-quality and is so small/portable that I carry it around in my purse whenever I go out, so the amount of times I have used it have nicely justified its price tag (which is pretty competitively priced to begin with).Things to note before you purchase:- The tripod legs are shorter than they appear in the product photo so I am unable to attach it to many things, but I tend to straighten the legs out to place the tripod on a flat surface anyway, so it hasn't been an issue so far.I received this flexible tripod stand from RIF6 for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing. Overall, this is a nifty product that I would definitely recommend to those who use their phone as their primary camera and would like an inexpensive tool to help improve their picture/video quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SD1CP5Y6X77K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6LVH74#wasThisHelpful","R3SD1CP5Y6X77K","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A must-have product if you have multiple tech gadgets in your household. I have a specific outlet in my house that I use to charge all of my devices, but as you can imagine, it gets frustrating having to remove a certain charger every time I want to plug in a different device.This 4-port USB charger has turned out to be incredibly handy for accommodating the simultaneous charging of multiple products at one time. Instead of being able to charge only two devices at the same time, I can now charge my two iPhones, my iPad, and my boyfriend's iPhone simultaneously without having to wait for one device to finish charging before plugging in another. I expected that my devices would take longer to fully charge with this 4-port device because of the greater distribution of power, but they charge in the same amount of time as they normally did when plugged directly into a wall socket.Very useful device in terms of functionality, and very fun and sleek in terms of aesthetic appeal due to its lightweight composition and colorful yet subtle design. I have tried quite a few different USB chargers, all of which each have their own unique characteristics that make them better or worse than others, but overall I would definitely recommend this particular 4-port charger because it is competitively priced for the amount of convenience and practicality that it provides.I received a sample of this 4-port USB fast charger from RIF6 for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6N5KW7CBYQC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OAAZM2C#wasThisHelpful","R6N5KW7CBYQC5","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried quite a few different power banks ranging from all kinds of colors to all kinds of levels of charging capacity, but this one definitely stands out from the pack as the most attractive and most powerful one I have used to date.Best features of this product:+ Beautiful and classy-looking product from the get-go. The packaging is incredibly fancy and almost makes you forget that you purchased this product from Amazon. The charger itself is sturdy, sleek, and is made of the same exterior color as my gold iPhone, so the two complement each other very well.+ Powerful charging capacity. This is a 10,000 mAh power bank, which is insane considering some of the other high-quality power banks I have tried are less than 5,000 mAh. I have been able to fully charge my phone a ton of times with the amount of stored power that this device contains.+ Takes approximately 45 minutes to fully charge my iPhone 6, which is pretty impressive for an external battery charger that isn't hooked up to an electrical outlet.+ Unique and subtle way of indicating remaining charging power: there are four small blue lights on the top with each one indicating 25% charging power, so each light gradually shuts off depending on how much power you have left in the bank.Things to note before you purchase:- This device is quite heavy and not the most practical for portability purposes. I usually keep it in my car or put it into my suitcase so I don't have to carry it around in my purse. However, this is a small sacrifice to make considering the amount of charging power I get in return. Overall, this product comes highly recommended, and I also noticed that it is being offered at a pretty competitive price. I've tried less powerful power banks before that cost twice the price of this one from Haidue.I received this product at a discounted price for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R166RA198E2AE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LK281F8#wasThisHelpful","R166RA198E2AE5","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great professional-grade nail clipper for dogs. I have two large Siberian Huskies who despise anyone touching their paws, so I decided to cut their nails myself instead of going to the groomers. I previously purchased a set of clippers from Walmart for a couple bucks less than this one, but it didn't cut cleanly through my dogs' thick nails and ended up causing one of my pup's nails to bleed. I did a little bit of research and came across these clippers by Boshel - this set in particular has a stainless steel blade that is made particularly for medium-to-large dogs, which was exactly what I was looking for.Best features of this product:+ Blades are powerful enough to cut cleanly through on the first try. The previous nail clipper created splits and left rough ends on my pups' thick nails, but this one cuts right through on the first try and leaves the nail short and smooth. I only have to cut each nail one time instead of having to make multiple cuts, which is a huge time-saver and gives the pups less of a chance to squirm away from me.+ Fits comfortably in my hand, and the non-slip rubber material on the handles allows me to have a tight grip to allow my other hand to securely hold their paws.+ Comes with a safety stop that prevents me from cutting the nail too deep. Great way to objectively determine the appropriate length of nail to cut off without risking injury to my pups.Things to note before you purchase:- If you haven't used dog clippers before, it will take some getting used to because you will undoubtedly be afraid of hurting your pup. Luckily, I found these ones to be quite self-explanatory and easy to use. Definitely recommend these nail clippers to anyone looking for a safe and high-quality nail clipper; it has really saved me a lot of money and grief now that I no longer have to bring my terrified pups to the groomers every month for a $5-10 manicure session.I received a sample of these dog nail clippers from Boshel for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3975XD8Y7M6Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QLMSYXG#wasThisHelpful","R3975XD8Y7M6Q3","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, this sleep mask IS as silky and soft as it looks in the product picture. I've tried a few different sleep masks and have to say that this is amongst my top two favorites - it is incredibly soft and very comfortable for extended periods of usage, especially while traveling.Best features of this product:+ Mask is very soft and comfortable; it does not apply pressure nor cause discomfort to my face.+ Mask does not shift while in use. I often toss and turn in my sleep, but I always wake up to the sleep mask being centered on my face. A big plus is that the mask's elastic band does not pull on my hair when I move around during the night.+ Conforms well to the shape of my face. My biggest criteria for sleep masks is being able to forget that I am wearing one when it's on my face, and this one in particular has accomplished that.+ High quality and luxurious. I'm not a big fan of using flimsy-looking masks while traveling for business, but this sleep mask looks luxurious and is pretty enough to wear during red-eye flights.Things to note before purchasing:- There is a filling inside the sleep mask that is great for blocking out light and keeping the mask feeling plush and soft. However, I washed it once after a few uses and noticed that the feeling shifted out of place, so some parts are now lumpier than others.I received a sample of this therapeutic sleep mask from Fishers Finery for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing. Overall, this is a well-designed, high-quality sleep mask offered at a very competitive price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UFU0KZ92TWTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAJONAY#wasThisHelpful","R1UFU0KZ92TWTO","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gluten-free and all-natural specialty product with a unique peppermint-flavored twist.Best features of this product:+ This deep dark fudge is reminiscent of dark chocolate - it is not too sweet and has that great subtle, bitter taste that is characteristic of darker chocolates.+ Perfect amount of sweetness for a chocolate fudge sauce. This is a delicate balance that is hard to achieve, but Sweet Carol Ann's does it well.+ The texture and consistency is great. It is not too thick and is easy to eat and spread.+ Versatile and multipurpose. It can be eaten out of the jar, as a food dip, on top of ice cream, with fruits, and so forth.+ Indulgent treat without the guilt. Since it is all-natural and gluten-free, it is accommodating of different diets.Things to note:- The peppermint flavor is quite strong and may not appeal to all taste buds. If you are a fan of the mint+chocolate combination, this product is perfect for you, but if you are on the fence about it like I am, then this might take some getting used to.I received a sample of this peppermint chocolate fudge sauce from Sweet Carol Ann's for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZZAJFL4R6GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYGTTF2#wasThisHelpful","RZZAJFL4R6GR","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was in search of a more affordable, multipurpose alternative to my department store-brand serums, which are pretty pricey and only treat one area of concern, such as aging only or acne only. Although this serum is marketed as anti-aging, I really think that it should more so be noted for its acne-fighting abilities because it has proved to be one of the most effective serums for acne I have tried.+ Surprisingly very effective for acne. I have acne-prone skin and did not expect this serum to help clear up my face because I thought it was just an anti-aging product, but the glycolic and salicylic acids have truly helped to clear up my oily skin and dry out my often-red blemishes.+ Essentially multiple beauty products combined into one. As part of my beauty routine, I use a daily face wash with salicylic acid, a nightly pore refiner primer, a daily serum, and a weekly exfoliator, all of which can get pretty expensive. This serum combines all of those different products into one since applying it a couple of times each week has helped to unclog my pores, exfoliate my skin of hidden residue, and clear up my blemishes.+ Multipurpose. This can be used as an all-over serum if you have aging skin concerns, or as a spot treatment if you have acne concerns. Personally, my blemishes respond well to glycolic and salicylic acid as an acne treatment, but my sensitive skin dries out if it gets too much of those two ingredients, so I have started using this serum as a nightly spot treatment.* One thing to note before purchasing is that different skin types will likely respond differently to glycolic and salicylic acid. These are very effective but strong ingredients that may dry out skin, so be sure to only use this serum all-over a couple of times each week, or prepare to use it as a spot treatment nightly. I do both on a regular interval basis and have seen drastic improvements in the way my skin looks - my blemishes around my chin have cleared up, and my face looks radiant without getting oily or shiny throughout the day. Highly recommend this product, and that is coming from someone who has tried seemingly a million different acne products the last few years.I received a sample of this anti-aging serum from Sublime Beauty for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L5O2WISRSRCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZP7ZIM#wasThisHelpful","R1L5O2WISRSRCB","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quality multipurpose oven mitts/pot holders. I intended to use this product to assist with draining pasta - I always have a hard time gripping the pot and pouring the pasta into the strainer because of the extreme heat, but these gloves have since made the process so much easier.Best features of this product:+ Water-resistant material. I have many oven mitts made of cotton fabric that always tend to get wet during the pasta draining process. These silicone gloves in particular are great for acting as a barrier against water.+ Plenty of control. The silicone material allows these gloves to be pretty thin in comparison to other super-thick kitchen mitts, which in turn provides me with plenty of control over my hands and fingers for gripping purposes.+ So much easier to use and clean. In addition to resisting water, these gloves resist stains, residue, etc., so I can just run them under the sink water once I'm done instead of having to laundry-wash them as I do with my cotton mitts.+ Nice, modern design. With the bright and fun color contrast, these gloves stand out amongst my other kitchen mitts.Things to know before you purchase:- Because these gloves are so thin, their ability to withstand heat is limited. It only goes up to 450 degrees, which is more than enough in most instances, but when I am gripping a hot pot or pan for an extended period of time, I can feel a bit of warm discomfort around my palms.I received a sample of these silicone oven mitts/pot holders from Love This Want This for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV1VE8IVEBPZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OL13WX6#wasThisHelpful","RV1VE8IVEBPZZ","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very cute and easy-to-use tea infuser. I especially appreciate its simplicity and subtle design as I've always used bagged tea and previously never needed a tea infuser. After receiving a set of expensive loose tea from a client, I was on the hunt for a simple and affordable tea infuser and came across this one by Comfify. It is an incredible price for the value - the tea infuser is made of stainless steel with a heat-resistant silicone base. Using it is as easy as placing some loose tea into the tea infuser and then submerging the tea infuser into hot water. The space for the tea leaves was more than enough to make one full, flavorful cup of tea. Keep in mind that the holes are a little bit big for smaller/finer tea leaves, but overall, this tea infuser got the job done and was competitively priced.I received a sample of this tea infuser from Comfify for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBBH5FG4IBIOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVOSNUE#wasThisHelpful","RBBH5FG4IBIOO","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have a Nexus 6 and are in the market for a screen protector, I would definitely recommend this tempered glass version as it offers much more protection than a typical screen protector film and protects well against water, dust, smudges, and minor scratches.Best features of this product:+ Tempered glass material allows it to withstand scratches up to 9H, which is great for everyday scratches and normal wear-and-tear you are bound to sustain if you keep your phone next to your keys, put it face down on the table, etc.+ Does not affect touch screen sensitivity. Many screen protectors tend to slightly inhibit sensitivity, but I have not noticed a change in how I use my touch screen.+ Crystal clarity. Many screen protectors I have tried have strange, tiny pixelation that distorts my image resolution, but this screen protection offers crystal clear resolution.+ Durable and offers more protection than typical screen protectors.+ Easy to apply. I have a minor case of OCD and hate having to install screen protectors, but found that this tempered glass version was very easy to align with and adhere to my phone.Things to note before you purchase:- This screen protector did not align perfectly with the Nexus 6. It was a little bit off on the corners, but not noticeable if you have a phone case on to cover those corners.- May not completely protect against high-impact falls. If you want it to 100% protect against high-impact falls, plan to look for something a little more heavy-duty, but overall, this tempered glass screen protector is great for everyday scratches/normal wear-and-tear and can withstand more impact than most screen protectors I have tried in the past.

"I love how sleek and subtle Xtava's designs are and have been purchasing them for my mom's beauty salon, but since this one has a more playful tiger-stripe design, I decided to keep it for personal use. I typically use 2-inch wide flat irons but opted for this one since it doubles well as both a hair straightener and a curler for natural waves/loose curls.Pros:+ Lightweight and does not make my hand/forearm sore after half an hour of use.+ Heats up very quickly and is easy to switch between different temperatures.+ 1-inch size is great for dual usage of straightening and curling - it is small enough to wrap hair around for natural waves/loose curls.+ Swivel cord makes it easy to move the flat iron in all directions.+ Built-in automatic safety mechanism that turns off after 30 minutes of not being in use. No more forgetting to turn off the flat iron and coming home to a burnt smell wafting through the house!+ Leaves hair silky and straight.+ Comes with a heat-resistant case that is great for protective and portability purposes.Areas for improvement:- Would have preferred a more sleek design comparable to their other products, but the tiger stripes are adorable and fun as well!I received this flat iron/hair straightener for the purposes of testing and reviewing, and my overall opinion is that this product is a great value for the many features it offers.

"The best thing about this particular brand, Xtava, is that their products all look so sleek and are incredibly well-designed for aesthetic appeal. My mom and I own a beauty studio, and we have been slowly introducing Xtava products because our clients tend to enjoy how cool and professional they look.Pros:+ LCD control display is stylish and easy to understand and use.+ 1-inch size is great for dual usage of straightening and curling if you have longer hair like myself.

"Very functional and strong hair dryer that looks sleek and stylish at the same time. I am a big fan of its design - the all-black with hints of blue is aesthetically appealing and fits in great at my mom's beauty salon. The heat and speed settings are easy to switch between, and I especially like how cold the air from the cool shot button is. Great for styling and quickly attaining that shiny sheen to clients' hair. The concentrator nozzles that come with the hair dryer are also efficient for faster drying on days when we are tight on time.Keep in mind that this hair dryer is compact and smaller than the typical hair dryer. This is both an excellent and poor component of its design. The great thing about its size is that it is very portable and easy to transport, and for how small it is, it is extremely powerful and effective at quickly drying hair. However, for its compact size, it is quite heavy, even heavier than the normal-sized blow dryer I previously purchased from this same brand, Xtava.I received this ionic ceramic hair dryer for the purposes of testing and reviewing, and overall, I think it is a great hair dryer, but not practical for extended use as its weight eventually puts a strain on the arm.

Definitely superior to the typical bulky towel that always seems to slip off and be more trouble than it's worth.Pros:+ Effective and dries hair faster than a typical towel.+ Lightweight and soft microfiber can absorb a good amount of water.+ Much lighter and less bulky than a regular towel, so it does put as much weight on my head nor slip off as easily.+ Just the right size for drying hair. My regular towels always tend to be too large or too small, but this one fits well.+ Does not leave my hair static-y or frizzy as I was expecting it to.Cons:- Works better on shorter hair than long hair.

This case is meant to provide enough protection on a daily basis without being too bulky and taking away from the phone's aesthetic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K9VIXJAA06NF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PV162AU#wasThisHelpful","R2K9VIXJAA06NF","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really like these reusable K-Cup pods. I recently tried a different brand of K-Cups but found that these ones by Filip Coffee are a bit more superior as they are better-designed and more aesthetically appealing.Pros:+ Very versatile; can be used for coffee, tea, hot chocolate. Just fill the K-Cup with your choice of drink/blend each morning.+ Compatible with Keurigs.+ K-Cups are hard all-around, which makes it easier to grip.+ Functional, convenient, and easy to use.+ Cute dolphin cut-outs on the side; looks great in person compared to typical boring K-Cups.+ Great value for 3 reusable pods.+ Very fast shipping. It was at my door within 24 hours of my order.Cons:- No instructions included; it would have been very helpful.I received this product for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing, and my take-away is that these reusable K-Cups by Filip Coffee are definitely a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly alternative to pricey K-Cups. They are great for both my pockets and the environment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y1XSB1AWN6DM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S02AEJ2#wasThisHelpful","R1Y1XSB1AWN6DM","A335WAHYHWCTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A335WAHYHWCTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very interesting and unique idea that has made gifting so much easier.Pros:+ Beautifully packaged. Comes in a compact-sized box with two of each kind of flower seed/greeting inside.+ Great mix of flowers.+ Practical and thoughtful gift that will outlast a typical greeting card.+ Perfect for every occasion.+ Great value: essentially 10 greeting cards AND flower seeds for only $1.99 each.+ USDA certified, organic, and non-GMO.Cons:- Would be great if the packet resembled more of a greeting card, perhaps with a foldable card and the package of seeds included inside. These packets currently have the greeting printed right on them.My mom absolutely hates it when I buy her anything, but when I gave her these seeds of love, she absolutely adored them and thanked me for my thoughtfulness.

"I bought this for our son-in-law... so I can't check to see if: the bars on the vial are calibrated for slope. I'm not a mason. You must pull the line absolutely straight or the level will be way off. Maybe the vial is plastic... then it wouldn't need a tiny window like the Stanley. To make the line level easy to find I removed the bubble plastic carefully, then stapled it to the cardboard back so it stays closed when the level is replaced.

"Much smaller physically than the capacitor we replaced. Start capacitors have a useful life. If you are fortunate to catch the failure of a start capacitor before it cycles your motor for hours and hours you won't end up needing a capacitor and motor. It is more difficult to discover a start capacitor that has slowly decreased in value, resulting in a damaged motor. I'm hoping that this physically smaller start capacitor will have a characteristic which results in a quick failure, rather than a gradual reduction on value which is more harmful to motors.

"I've always felt that Disney should be making special Tinkerbell toys or light sets or something; she flies and lights up... they ought to be able to create a desirable item with that. We have a Christmas tree in our train room with hundreds of cartoon figures: Disney, Simpsons, Barbie and more. It also has over a hundred illuminated cartoon figures. A Tinkerbell and Friends set of ligkts would be perfect since they light up already.I bought the Flutterbye the minute I saw one fly into a fireplace on Facebook. (We don't have a fireplace... just a granddaughter.) It looks fragile but is well designed and rugged. It wasn't the surprise we expected; our granddaughter already had one. But she was delighted that there was one at 'Grandma's' to play with. She didn't realize that a single depression would lower Tinkerbell slowly; she just knew repeated presses would bring it crashing to the floor. That was a useful lesson in itself.The toy is designed for a child's hand. A large adult size hand will cause it to fly too high. Our granddaughter, on the other hand, could make it hover above her hand pretty well, but it does have a tendency to end up flying against the ceiling. Our son in law was amazed that it could be controlled by the base and equally amazed that the toy can fly without Tinkerbell spinning around. It doesn't appear to have a gyroscope, but may have a motion sensor chip; they put them in so many things that the cost must be down to a dollar or son.I was considering 'weighting' the figure to keep it off the ceiling, but that depends on the state of charge of the batteries, so haven't done it yet. Don't fly it in front of an air conditioner or fan... or outside.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GBZ2DJ5ECAHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IP3EUIW#wasThisHelpful","R3GBZ2DJ5ECAHA","A108B8OUQ0GHNF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A108B8OUQ0GHNF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm glad I accidentally stumbled across Winehouse in a online video. I immediately bought CDs and this LP. Few pop, or whatever the heck they refer to as music these days, singers are enjoyable to me today. I'd really like to find something by Reading's own Taylor Swift that I like. She is a beautiful woman and smart businesswoman, but I don't like her voice; her early country better than recent music. Even Billy Holiday did nothing for me... or Janice Joplin. Aretha is in a class of her own. Blues from a white woman usually seem derivative to me. Amy Winehouse was one of a kind; they'll never be another like her. And she had to work at it.

"This tea maker teapot is a perfect way to prove how beautiful simplicity actually is.  The amazingly beautiful box and matching gift bag really do add so much class and beauty to what is already an amazing gift.  Being able to see what you are brewing helps you to create the strength of tea you desire, but it also offers a beautiful natural glow and color to this super set.  Tea's do come in many different shades and colors so you can even make a brew to blend in with the room or table setting if you want and this set will show off the perfection.Borosilicate glass is a wonderful and strong material that holds up in very high heat.  This pot won't crack or break from getting too hot.  Even the little cups ensure that your brew remains perfect.  Each cup is double walled to provide insulation, but in my opinion the double walls also make the cups even more attractive.  For brewing loose leaf tea, the removable filter is amazing.  The filter is also made from the same spectacular sparkling glass and has very fine slits in the bottom to keep your tea as clear and pure as possible.  The slits actually look like decorative etching to me.Each piece is naturally very light weight and the teapot handle is very easy to hold and pour with.

With a quick touch of a button you can pause, answer, and operate this light weight device.The magnetic fitting where the earpieces go is perfect.  They snap in with very little effort from me.  I mentioned how light weight these are and much of that is due to the extremely flexible piece that goes around the neck.

They have the ability to put me in the mood for a nice glass of wine by just looking at them.Beauty isn't the only great thing about these.  You can see and feel the impeccable quality of the canvas used and the high print resolution is fantastic!  These canvas' are actually waterproof and UV resistant.  I'm sure they will be handed down through generations and continue to look as radiant as they do today.Not only are these perfect in a dining room, kitchen, over a bar, or really just about anywhere in your home, they would be wonderful in many places of business as well.  They come right out of the shipping box ready to hang.  If you have a wine enthusiast on your gift list or even just someone that appreciates beauty these would be perfect.*I was offered these beautiful canvas' at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R153HNOD4Q36H7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014P32H1C#wasThisHelpful","R153HNOD4Q36H7","AG20O14G9SVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG20O14G9SVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These swaddle blankets are adorable and practical to boot!  The size of the blankets are perfect.  The organic muslin cotton is so lightweight and soft against the little ones.  I love that these are large enough that you can use them to block the sun, keep the cool breeze away, for nursing privacy, and even spreading out on the floor for the baby to stretch and have tummy time.  The terrific thing is that you don't have to be a professional swaddler.  These are much easier than small blanket to get wrapped the correct way.  They also keep the little child warm without over heating them.  They wash beautifully and dry quickly so your favorite blankets will be ready any time you need them.The clips are awesome for clipping the blankets on to the handles of strollers, car seats and baby carriers.  My daughter actually uses one to clip the material together around her as she breastfeeds.  They open wide enough that they fit easily on most handles and they seem very sturdy.The colors are really soft and soothing and the prints are very sweet.*I was offered this awesome gift set at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A9YUZ27WI8E0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017BNOU1S#wasThisHelpful","R2A9YUZ27WI8E0","AG20O14G9SVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG20O14G9SVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So much fun and such an awesome experience with texture.  I got these for my grandchildren and the 2 year old was the first to make one.  He LOVED it!  In fact, he wanted to create so many and play so long with it I was scared it was going to dry out.  Luckily it worked very well the entire 1 1/2 hours he worked with it!  His attention span is extraordinary if he really likes something and apparently these are a gigantic hit!  We had so many educational conversations during our snowman time, e.g.  real snow is cold and turns in to water, how many eyes do we have, is the snowman your are making hard or soft, etc...  We had baby snowmen, flat snowmen, snow puddles, and funny snowmen that couldn't eat without a mouth.  We laughed and had a blast.The texture is nice.  I personally wanted to continue playing with it as well.  It sticks very well to itself so that makes it easy for little ones.  It can be rolled, flattened, and you can even make imprints in it. The body parts are also easy to put on and change, (great for small motor coordination).  I finally got him talked in to finishing his and promised I had more to make tomorrow.  He presented it to his Mommy and Daddy and was extremely proud of himself.I am a retired teacher and love this type of thing.  I can only give this 5 stars but it deserves many more.  The bonding and educational aspects alone are priceless.*I was offered this snowman at a reduced rate in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BQGBMQXFN2CX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJLN352#wasThisHelpful","R1BQGBMQXFN2CX","AG20O14G9SVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG20O14G9SVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a beautiful set of ceramic knives!  Not only are they pretty, they are very well made and extremely sharp.  The handles are wonderful!  They have a rubber coating so they don't slip in your hand and when a knife is as sharp as these are you do not want them slipping!  The handle is also shaped nicely and fits really well in my hand.  They are very lightweight, in fact, they are much much lighter than metal knives.I've had knives sets with covers before but they all are the same color, e.g. all white!  It is so helpful to have these pretty bright colors with matching handles and covers.  Very easy to find in the drawer and very easy to keep track of.  Even my husband commented on how nice it was to be able to see what sharp object you need and then pick it up knowing it is safely covered.  The slicer/peeler is a nice little bonus!These wash really well.  I don't put them in the dishwasher because ceramic will chip, but they come clean very easily with just warm soap and water.  The slight possibility of chipping is another reason that it is wonderful to have such amazing covers!The quality and the presentation and looks of this set would make it an amazing and impressive gift!*I was offered this set at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CWSJLQD61AG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147JKIUQ#wasThisHelpful","R2CWSJLQD61AG9","AG20O14G9SVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG20O14G9SVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first cast iron cookware and my first dutch oven.  I have always wanted cast iron so I was very excited to get this.  A few years ago our daughter's doctor said she was slightly anemic and suggested she cook with cast iron.  I had no idea that using cast iron actually increases the iron fortification in foods.  What a win win situation.Since getting this I've prepared a wonderful stew on the stove top and a great chicken casserole in the oven.  Both came out very tasty and cooked evenly.  The pan is very easy to clean.  Since it is enameled you just have to be sure it is completely cool when you wash it with warm soapy water.  It really came clean quickly using a sponge.  They also recommend that you preheat your pan for 2 or 3 minutes before you put oil or liquid inside to preserve the pan as well as making cleanup much easier.  I did that and I feel like it did help.The red is absolutely beautiful.  I also love the easy to grasp handles and knob.  The lid seals very well which keeps the steam and heat from escaping which in turn keeps me from burning my hands.  The food inside also stays hot much better and longer due to the nice tight seal.I really am loving this new cookware and look forward to years and years of usage.*I was offered this pan at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8KDD6XS3HX8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145TK25Y#wasThisHelpful","R8KDD6XS3HX8Q","AG20O14G9SVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG20O14G9SVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was excited when I saw this tee.  It is so beautiful in person.  The detailing is gorgeous.  On the right lower side there is an area that is gathered with elastic which really adds to the uniqueness and personality.  The top section on the back is a spectacular sheer floral lace. The lace meets the solid material dipping in the center which looks so classy.  All of the material on the tee is nice and stretchy since it is a blend of polyester and spandex. The material holds it's shape very well and has a nice weight to it.  All of the stitching is precise and the hemlines are double stitched.This tag advises dry clean only but I have to admit that we hand washed and air dried it.  I won't recommend that since the company doesn't but it still looks brand new.  We used a very mild detergent.I purchased this top for my 26 year old daughter and she is in love with it.  She has worn several colors of camisoles underneath and all of them looked wonderful.  The fit is a close fit due to the elasticiy in the material.  It runs a little small.  Usually if she can wear a top I can too but it is a little small for me.I am thrilled with the quality and look of this tee and would highly recommend it to anyone.*I was offered this tee at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EQW4BDKWSMR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DN4LC0#wasThisHelpful","R2EQW4BDKWSMR0","AG20O14G9SVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG20O14G9SVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice set of mixing bowls.  They are so attractive but better yet they are very well made and have a lot of perks other mixing bowls don't have.  I am totally thrilled with the lids on these.  They seal completely and are airtight.  You can use them after mixing to store what needs to be stored without having to find a different container.  I even use them when I have leftovers that I didn't use the mixing bowl during preparation.  The lids seal so well that it would take a lot for one to come off, even if it fell to the floor!The bottom is silicone so it doesn't slide around during use.  I love the bright orange.  It just really adds to the appeal of this set.  The bottom of the bowls is a lightly brushed stainless steel that changes to a smooth shiny stainless steel towards the top.  To get the lids off they have made it simple by putting lips on the lids that you can simply lift up on.  Inside each bowl it shows measurement lines which is also an advantage.I highly recommend this set.  I love it!

"I am very happy with the weight and texture of this moisturizer.  It is light weight, non-greasy, not sticky, and leaves your skin feeling very smooth and silky feeling.  There really isn't much of a smell which is great if you have trouble with scents irritating your skin.  I have been using this lightly both morning and evening before bed.  After washing my face I put a light layer of my favorite serum on and then follow through with this.  My makeup goes on beautifully after using this product.I feel that the longer I use this the better my skin is looking.

"These are very comfortable as well as durable.  You can hardly tell you have them on.  They are great for everyday wear but for fishing, sports, and water activities they are amazing.  The polarized lenses are very nice.  There is virtually no glare and they block the UV rays very well.  The way they wrap and fit securely on your face lessens the chance of them falling off if you are active or leaning over water, etc...  The hinge on these is durable and should last through a considerable amount of wear.It is a bonus that these nice looking glasses look great on everyone in my family that tried them on.

"I have been using this product just long enough now that I am honestly starting to see a difference.  This is a cream that can be used anywhere since it is very gentle and safe for sensitive skin but I have concentrated for the most part on my neck and under my chin area.  No, it didn't get rid of my extra chin, and I don't expect it to.  It has however made the wrinkles appear less deep.  My skin actually looks and feels a little bit tighter and smoother.  Those are pretty impressive results for just over a week of steady use.A little goes a very long way with this product.  It isn't greasy and it doesn't feel sticky.  The white cream is fairly thick but not heavy and really absorbs very well.  Makeup goes on smoothly over the top after it absorbs and drys.  I do feel like this would be safe for just about anybody.  I have sensitive skin and have had no irritation.  In fact my skin feels amazing and healthier.  On my face I do get very oily areas so that is one reason I haven't used it on my face as much.  The few time I applied it on my face I only did it one time during the day.  I try to apply it daily both morning and night on my neck and under my chin.I am actually quite impressed with the very early progress this cream has made and I highly recommend it.*I was offered this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KBQ14F09W9ZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0PDMA0#wasThisHelpful","R3KBQ14F09W9ZG","AG20O14G9SVT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG20O14G9SVT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pendant is very pretty and I love the size of it.  I also really like the length of the chain and appreciate that it can be extended for those of us that  have larger necks or want to wear the necklace hanging just a little bit longer.  I would consider the chain to be thicker than most.  Both the chain and the pendant have a little bit of weight which makes this piece hang very nicely.  In the photo the flowers look pink but mine looks more like a lavender or grey.  I really like the color mine is, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  The flowers inside do move around which makes this very unique.The pendant itself has a lot of detailing.  The glass is cut in a way that really provides reflection, shine, and beauty.  I've gotten many complements when wearing this and feel it would make a great gift for someone.  The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the color difference in the flowers.

" 4:48 MinsThis is an awesome product that is very easy to assemble and operate.  I personally am using it to keep little critters from going under my front porch and multiplying.  I love animals of all kinds so this seemed like the most humane way to reduce the reproduction of kittens, gofers, and what ever else wants to sneak under there for shelter.  I can tell it is effective by the way my indoor pets reacted to it when I was testing it.  My dog hid and whimpered and my cat left the room and complained by meowing VERY loudly.  They are both fine now, but they sure didn't want to sniff it or get near it.There are 5 modes and depending upon the environment you can choose the one you feel is best.  It does go off fairly easily so if it needs to be set up in or close to the house where you can hear it, the alarm is sensitive and loud so trying a different setting first to solve the pest or critter problem might be the way to go.  If you have it set up further away, etc... then just choose which mode seems to work best.Turning it on and off is as simple as holding the button down a little longer.  Switching modes is done by shorter clicks.  It comes with aluminum tubes that can be hooked together and then to the main unit.  I am using mine in a small flower pot so I am using the stake.  This can get wet but it isn't to be submersed.  I took extra precautions by putting it a little ways under the porch overhang where it will get a little wet from time to time but usually not drenched.  I have also chosen to run an outdoor extension cord to it since mine is fairly close to the house, this is very easy to do in my particular case.The instructions are simple and set up is minimal.

"I'm using this product as I type and loving it.  Since it has adjustable heights it works just about any where I need it to work, e.g. dining room table,  any desk, and even when I'm in the recliner I can put it on my lap.  It is extremely easy to snap together so if you need to adjust it with each move that isn't a problem.  The bottom of each leg has a skid resistant pad which really works well.  There is an area to run cords on the back of the stand and there are two very handy slightly slanted trays, one on each side.  I love using the trays for pens, notes, paperclips, phone, anything you might need to have handy.  I use this with a laptop but it is also great for a monitor, or a variety of tablets and phones.

"Ok, let's be honest here. I knew what I was getting into--a little erotic fluff. I didn't expect much. But even so, I was disappointed. I really wish I had read this on my kindle so that I could search the word never to see how many times it popped up. Because that's basically what this book is, a list of things Ivan did that Erin had never encountered. Never had a man looked at her like that. Never had a man made her feel so safe. Never had a man touched her like that. Never had a man been so enticing. Never had she had a man with such a big c*ck. Never had a man made her come so often (seriously, it's inhuman how frequently and with so little effort she can climax).Never, never, never and that's before we even get into Ivan's nevers. Never had he seen a a woman look so innocent. Never had he been so mysteriously attracted to someone. Never had he let his guard down. Never had he broken his own rules, never, never, never. And these two people are supposed to have known each-other for 8 hours.The whole book is so oversimplified and ham-fisted I honestly think the author could have just listed the tropes and comparisons she was using and the story would have been just as discernible. Tattoos equal violence. Big equals manly. Small equals feminine. Big eyes equal innocence. Drug addiction equals whore. Even the attraction is instant and unexplained. Literally, ""The instant we made contact an electric zing arced through me. What? Why?Then, to top it all off (and this is a little spoilery), the author wimped out on Ivan's past. She spent the whole book talking up how violent he must be, because he has so many tattoos (and yes, I get that tats in the Russian mob are supposed to be symbolic, but one would assume this was within reason), then it turns out he's horribly ashamed of his non-murderous (and frankly not that bad) history with the mob, thereby invalidating all the buildup.Lastly there was the sex. I mentioned Erin's propensity to insta-orgasm. We'll just leave that one alone. I'm afraid I just didn't find the sex scenes in this book erotic. Nothing in what was done or the way anything was described appealed to me. It read like a Ikea kit directions sheet--insert this here, turn that there, etc. It all left me skimming (and that's unfortunately not a euphemism of anything good).","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H0TESOYHA1IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BKRR2MG#wasThisHelpful","R2H0TESOYHA1IW","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suppose there will be an audience out there for this book. It's trying very hard to be Douglas Adams-like and plenty of people (myself included) love Douglas Adams' quirky humor. IMHO, this doesn't quite make it though, as a Douglas Adam's clone or on it's own.On a positive note, it's well written and surprisingly well edited for a self-published book. There are some interesting, odd-ball characters and had the whole thing been a set up for Katie and Chintz's last moment's, I'd have called it a success. But it's about 1/3 too long (if not more) for that to be the case.If I had to condense this review to a few carefully chosen words, they would be presumptuous and self-indulgent. The author's constant breaking of the fourth wall especially. As if the book wasn't quite quirky enough the author/narrator had to stick his two cents in too. It was annoying and broke up the story.It was this over the top quirkiness that eventually ruined the book for me. You have characters who speak in mixed up, nonsense for no apparent reason at all. You have POVs from the perspective of a cat. You have a narrative style dedicated to pointing out the absurd over the expected, which could have been great if not quite so over played. You have philosophy passed off as science and science of the hard-core hand waving variety. It was all too much for me.And that is a shame, because Boyd's descriptive ability is wonderful. I appreciated the distinct lack of alpha hero and the success of the socially anxious, nerd heroes. I liked that there was a strong female character (though I'm borderline on the fact that her sexuality caused such ruptions. I think the book skirted the cliche, but JUST BARELY).

"This was almost a winner for me. It had an interesting world, interesting characters, a convoluted plot, and people/fairies doing things for deeply personal reasons. And for the most part, outside of some repetition, the writing was very readable. It could have been really really good. Instead, it was ok.There were several reasons for this. One, there were about 4 billion characters, each with a plot thread of their own. It was too much and became confusing. Two, the narratives, from all these characters perspectives were often provided to the reader in very brief snippets. At one point we got about a page of one character getting sea sick and then jumped away again. It was jarring and not a particularly engaging way to read a story. (It made the book feel very long.) Lastly, the book, with all its many many plot points doesnt wrap up. So, youve been presented with multiple mysteries, none of which are solved. This is a BIG no-no for me.All in all, it has some fun fantasy characters and the beginning of what will probably be an intriguing storyline 1,000 pages from now. If youre willing to commit to the long haul its worth picking up. I dont know that I am.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35BG2MZJR28OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y1Y48RC#wasThisHelpful","R35BG2MZJR28OP","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this was a sweet little story. It's basically about two men falling in love, that's it, nothing flashy or exciting, but it's sweet. What saves it from being boring is that the two men in question are the type of men who rarely make it as main characters, a 43-year-old drifter/chronically homeless man and a 33-year-old crippled man with a traumatic brain injury. And the book proves that readers (or at least this one) don't need infallible, godly gorgeous, alpha men as heroes. I adored Chase and Jimmy (Chase especially).It is a bit of an insta-love, which is unfortunate, because it's not really supported. I have no idea why Chase tried so hard to keep Jimmy around, but I'm glad that he did. I also thought it was a little on the predictable side. But again, it's a fairly straight forward romance, so it wouldn't have been overly realistic to have too many twists and turns. All-in-all, it was a book that made me happy to see the HEA (even if it did get a little sappy there at the end).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L5CSC98GEQUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JT4QV6#wasThisHelpful","R1L5CSC98GEQUK","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bah, it was ok but not much more. Here's the thing, the writing seemed fine but everything was waaaaaay over described and nothing of significance really happened. Don't get me wrong, things blew up, the air ship almost crashed like 400 times, people ran around and said droll things, but in terms of an overall story arc it didn't really show up until about page 350. Yes, the leaders had been kidnapped and the crew was rescuing them, but that's not really much of a plot as presented here. It's just an excuse to be off doing things.So, even though I checked this out of my local library along with the sequel, I'm returning them both. I'm not going to bother with the second book. I'm just not interested enough and I have a strong suspicion that, if it takes 350 pages to finally present the real plot in this book, it's probably the same in book two, which means I'll likely finish it little more satisfied than I am now.

"This one ticked a lot of boxes for me. I have come to love Hassell's writing style and his basic....I don't know what to call it, tone maybe. Just the way everything I've read by him, regardless of the genre, has a certain feel to it that I love. It's gritty. It's real. It's maybe even a little nihilistic. It pretends happily ever after can't exist, even if a character gets it in the end. Maybe you'd have to read his stuff for that to make sense.In Stygian Hassell has created a host of seemingly unlikable characters. I mean all of these guys repelled me at some point, some so much I didn't think they'd be redeemable. But Hassell pulled that off too. The whole thing is as creepy and atmospheric as you'd expect a gothic style, Southern horror novel to be, with a villain that's maybe a little more complex than first appearances suggest.My only real complaint is that I didn't really feel the connection between Kennedy and Jeremy. A lot of it is pre-existing, based on events prior to the time frame of the novel. I definitely felt what Hassell is doing here, but I had to just take his word for it. As much as I liked Kennedy and Jeremy (and I did), the strength of emotion seemed sudden. (Though some of this feeling was ameliorated after reading the prequels.)Lastly, there had better be a sequel or I may have to go a little Annie Wilkes on Hassell. (Ok, not really, but please be a sequel.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K9W20B360WCK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016H8X136#wasThisHelpful","R1K9W20B360WCK","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I like that the son wasn't a sniveling baby, but also wasn't overly confident. I liked that people were smart and could read between lines and such. I enjoyed the alternative world and the basic story-line. I also just plain enjoyed the writing style.I did think it got a little slow at times and dragged a little here and there.

"Another fluffy, easy read. As in the first book, I liked Raylene's OCDness and the way she was just so matter of fact about it. I liked her side kick. I liked her family-building, as well as the fact that romance is hinted at but never becomes part of the story. I also liked the writing and narrative style, which is surprising as it's first person and I generally don't like first person. I did think this one came across as a little juvenile. Mostly because Raylene was tasked with hunting down baculum, which requires 14 thousand references to penis bones and the likes. It because apparent that this was there for comic effect, but it also made me feel like a 15 year old would have appreciated it more.

"I picked this up as a random audiobook from the library. While nothing about it amazed me, I was amused throughout the entirety of it. Kitty's 'I've always been weak' bothered me, but it was also always in context of 'I'm not anymore,' so I dealt with it. I did feel like the book didn't really accomplish anything significant. The smaller mystery was solved, but the primary conflict wasn't and the book felt a little like a randomly selected period of time. But as a basic fluff read, the book did the job admirably. My library has the next two.

"When I came to write this review is when I discovered that this is a second in a series. I wouldn't have picked it up if I had known that. I like to read series in order. But I don't think having read the first book would have made me like it any more. But I am always baffled why publishers don't put that information on book covers. It's freakin' important!Anyhow, this book was a fail for me. My overall impression was of overpowering almost unbearable cheesiness. Everything about The Slayers was too perfect. Sorren flashed cash constantly, bought Micah new clothes, pampered his cat, had an easy solution for everything, etc. As an example, at one point Micah demands $1,000 a night as a fee in order to accept a job. This is apparently the going rate for a skilled dancer. (I don't know.) The counter offer was an apartment in the five star building, food, living expenses (hair cuts, clothes, massages, sex are listed as examples), and $5,000 a show. Um....too good to be true and painfully unbelievable. But pretty par for the course of a book trying too hard to be like a fairy tale.But my main complaint was with the characters. There was no depth at all, no history, no development. And as much as I like the occasional growly alpha a-hole, Sorren was just a dick. Here's a quote: ""No! I refuse to discuss limitations, or contracts. I am a Dom and in my dungeon, we go by my rules. I will push you to the edge and you will trust me to give you pleasure."" That pretty much sums the book up. That's the level of trust and communication presented as the norm. Keep in mind that these men have known each-other less than a day and this is his response to Micah's request for boundaries.There's an earlier scene, in which they had known each-other less than an hour and Micah asks Sorren if he's into edge play, 'cause for Sorren Micah claimed to be willing to learn it. Micah had never done more than be spanked and they were no discussing kink, but hey let's throw this random one out as an invitation. No matter that less than an hour earlier he'd watched his best friend get his throat slit and been stabbed himself. Of course knife play is gonna be exactly what the reader expects him to be fantasizing about. WTF? What the actual f*ck?Basically, I found the plot anemic, the use of ""I'm a Dom"" to excuse and explain almost everything in life irritating and artificially highlighted, the cheesy 'Dom-speak' like sandpaper, the villain cliche beyond words, the events predictable, Micah was TSTL, and the whole thing (almost every aspect of it) rushed and underdeveloped. The actual writing itself was fine. The book is easy enough to read, but not much of what was written actually appealed to me personally.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TQJC30GAMZUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WSAZ3MA#wasThisHelpful","R3TQJC30GAMZUG","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh man, some serious mixed feelings on this one, but I loved it overall. I thought it was marvelously written, with vivid, gritty characters and identifiable character growth that never, ever got sappy. Plus, the alternative present was interesting. It really made me stop and think about how easily computers could creep into our lives in insidious and destructive ways.I can't say it all worked out the way I would have liked. I was sorely disappointed in Jim's dismissal and Desmond sure isn't a likable character (I honestly don't think he earned or deserved his happily ever after.

"I obviously wasn't looking for a serious read when I picked this book up to listen to. I thought it might be silly and fun, and since I never saw the movie, I'd at least know the plot then. The problem is that I didn't realize that it is a novel based on the screenplay for the movie, as opposed to the book the screenplay is based on. Thus, it reads just as a movie would play out and any of the additional depth that makes a book preferable to the screen is missing.While I the occasional shadows of important themes pop up, not a single one is ever explored or expanded on. The book is action-packed, but not much else. All-in-all, there wasn't much to recommend it. At least the movie had some cool actors in it; all this had was an overly breathy, over-acted voice.

"**Spoiler alert**I'm not planning to give anything significant away, but I do plan to discuss the ending.3.5I have some real mixed feelings on this one, because some aspects of it I really loved and others not so much. Before I get to any of that, let me just say the writing here is marvelous and the late 70s-through 80s was a wonderful setting. My only real complaint, writing-wise, is that Will/Billie's journaling didn't really work for much of the book. His/her* POV is provided in the format of a diary, and it works in the beginning. But as the book progresses his entries become longer and more narrative-like, until eventually they no longer read like diary entries at all. The language is too florid, the descriptions too rich, the details too frequent to be a believable diary entry. It was a pleasure to read if you ignored the fact that it was supposed to be what it was supposed to be.I liked both characters a lot and I really liked their...I'll call it a romance, even though it's not really. Neither acknowledges it as such. But their thoughts about eachother are sweet in a romantic (though not erotic) kind of way. I liked this a lot.I did have some trouble believing Will's transsexualism. And I don't think I should have. The author's research was apparent...a little too apparent at times. Some of his experiences were just a little too textbook. But mostly my trouble arose because his self-exploration took the form of some kind of soft focus, bemused curiosity. There was no anger, shame, disgust or bad feelings about himself or his body at all. Not to suggest all transgendered individuals must feel this way, but every real-world account I've come across or interview series or personal account, etc all heavily accentuate this as part of recognizing they are not residing in the correct body. Will just sort of floats along wondering if he's gay or not and then suddenly meats a transsexual and decides that's what he is. I couldn't buy it.I understand that up until a certain point he can only consider himself in ways he has a perspective for, and sexuality was something his worldview presented as possible for exploration and gender was not. I understood that, but I never sensed he had any real issue with his body, until suddenly he did. It all felt kind of sanitized.This was all exasperated a little bit by the fact that he's described as being so obviously feminine. This is emphasized to such a degree that I felt that having a feminine appearance was integral to being transgendered, as if he couldn't have been if he was 6' 2"", 200lbs and balding. Don't get me wrong, I really liked him as a character and I was willing to accept what I was bing told, but I had to make a conscious decision to do so.Tom, however, Tom I bought completely. I really enjoyed his oblique self-revelations. I liked that he tried so darned hard to be a good man and failed over and over again. I loved his self-reproach and cowardice. He was a s** (and I'm pretty sure that'd be the word he used to describe himself), but he was a s*** who was trying to learn to be a better man. But this is part of why I had trouble with the events involving his ex-wife that led to the ending. It's not that I don't think he would do it in some circumstance, but I thought that bridge had been burned a little too thoroughly for a man trying to break free to cross again. Especially since the ex-wife was such the clich manipulative harpy.Actually, I had a lot of trouble with the end. I have to just come out and ask, what is with all the unnecessary tragedy? I mean, it's the story the author wanted to tell, so it's not pointless per se, but a very real part of me wants to ask why non-cisgendered/heterosexual characters almost never just get an unmitigated happy ending. It's like they're the Red Shirts of the romance realm. Why do they have to suffer (be punished) before being given a little scrap of happiness they are expected to be thankful for, even in books like this one, that I'm confident was written in support of such characters?I did really appreciate how richly the characters lives were depicted and how visceral the time period was shown to be. People have real problemsmental illness, abuse, neglectful parents, alcoholism, hopelessness, illness, infertility. And I liked that these are realistic blue collar people. Tom joins the army then works in a factory. Nothing glamorous in that, but it's real-life for so many people.All in all, I had a few rather major complaints about the book (or certain aspects of it), but I generally really liked it. I liked Will/Billie and Tom. I liked their slow realizations. I liked the depth of writing and the patience with which the plot progresses. I think the book is well worth picking up.*I use both pronouns here, instead of just the feminine, because for much of the book Will is unaware of his gender dysmorphia and Will and Billie are almost presented as separate characters. To ignore Will (him/he) would leave out an integral part of the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UXAWEUX6VV2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014DP8EXC#wasThisHelpful","R2UXAWEUX6VV2O","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novella and I had some serious disagreements. The least egregious of them being that it was largely written as tell and not show and I felt absolutely no connection to any of the characters as a result.More problematic for me was how very clich some aspects of it were. The villain is a scorned woman. Seriously, is there really no other reason a woman might turn bad than over a man? It's a literary device that I am simply bored to tears with (and becoming slightly offended by).Most troubling however was the fact that it kind of misses its mark as a myth. Ancient gods and goddesses were often depicted as representatives of chaos or destruction or even evil, but they were just that, representations of a recognizable aspect of humanity that usually had a converse somewhere. Their madness or pettiness or jealousies were part of a bigger picture. To me, Belovaya was just an evil, jealous woman with godly powers. There was no sense that she played a part in a pantheon, that there might be a balancing persona (be it hers or in another) anywhere that gave her existence purpose or context.Meh, this one was a miss for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N0HFU4LIRA8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFTKVN8#wasThisHelpful","R1N0HFU4LIRA8Q","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Meh, I found it unimpressive. It wasn't bad. The world-building was pretty good and there was some humor. But it just was nothing new or exciting either.I think the author was going for a strong determined heroine, but she just came across as selfish and stubborn to me. She also did a lot of crying and sleeping. There was a POINTLESS and BASELESS love triangle for a little while. I didn't understand Criminy's obsessive love for woman he just met. I thought the bad guy was cheesy and she defeated him too easily. But most of all I thought the whole thing felt random. They ran here and did this. Then, they ran there and did that.

"It's basically what's on the tin. It's a small book that reminds you to be positive, confident and mindful in life. There is a definite ""Duh"" element here, but I believe it really is meant as a reminder rather than a lesson learned anew. And in that regard it's a sweet, quick read with some lovely illustrations. I do wonder if the author noticed that she made almost all of the bad examples (the person who keys a car instead of asks for his job back, the person who blackmails someone instead of blames himself, is petty and concerned with a boyfriend instead of a job) female. I suspect a little of America's underlying sexism slipped in.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C28JWFBXMR5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FE02MB6#wasThisHelpful","R3C28JWFBXMR5X","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is something about a man in a kilt. Hmmm, yes there is. Honestly, I think there is something about a man in just about any traditional costume. It seems to push the same buttons as a man in a well-tailored suit. Yum. So the very premise of this story ticked a couple boxes for me. And believe me, if kilts tickle your fancy, you need this book. There are some scenes.....It also has two cute, likable leads. I enjoyed them and their irritation, embarrassment and eventual working out of differences.The story kind of lost me at the end though. I understand that the ending opens the story up to further books. It would make a good series. But, for me, it was too sharp a left turn. It diverged too far from the story I had come to expect.

"OK, I'll be honest, sappy romance is not my thing and this is super sappy romance and not much else. So, I wasn't particularly predisposed to enjoy it. I gave it a shot though, sometimes stories surprise you. This one did not. Not only is it super sappy, but it's hollow. Essentially a girl hasn't seen a guy since high school and barely knew or noticed him then. But on receiving an invitation to their 5 year reunion she immediately thinks of him and KNOWS, just knows, he is the one. They meet back up and fall instantly in love, just as she knew they would.

"This was a middle of the road read for me. Some aspects of it I quite enjoyed, like the dwarf and the spectacled kid, as well as a few of the other low ranking soldiers.

I thought no one reacted realistically to the odd things happening around them and I thought the battles went on and on and on.I think I'll probably read the next one in the series, since it's in my library and I can do so for free, but I'm not really racing out to get it as soon as possible.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VSAD4SUK3B37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BNDVM4#wasThisHelpful","R1VSAD4SUK3B37","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to preface this review by noting that I read this book for my book club and it is not a book I would have picked up on my own. As a result, I can't say I enjoyed reading it. I felt satisfied by the ending (thank goodness) but I basically had to force myself to read it. This, however, is more a symptom of not being a preferred story type for me than actual quality of the book or writing.Having said all that, there were a few things that I think, even outside my general dislike of depressing fiction, are worth mention and critique. First, while I understand Josephine is/was an artist and sees/saw things through an artists eye, the overly descriptive writing got on my nerves. Even in people's hand written letters to one another, they were describing refracted light and how the moon shimmered, etc. It was just too much for me.Secondly, the interminable lists, there are soooo many lists of things in the book, some of them very long. Yes, some of this served a purpose, but god, so boring to read. Third, there are a number of unbelievable coincidences that occur. Yes, some of them could be that information wasn't hidden so much as no one had thought to look for it, but still Lina's investigation was too easy.Fourth, why did Lina have to romantically consider almost every man she encountered? You don't see this with male characters. Fifth, the resolution of the mother...just no; that's all I'll say on that.I did very much appreciate that there was no apology for, dressing up or hiding the horrors of slavery. Nor was it ever gratuitously shown. We didn't need to see a man whipped to death or a woman raped to know those things were happening. The inhumanity of the establishment came through quite clearly, as did some people's blindness to it and other's struggles with living with it but feeling helpless to change it, even when they wanted to.My final assessment is that this is what it is, a thought provoking, 'book club' sort of book. Does anyone read these just for enjoyment? No one I know.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9S9E8ROLJWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089LODXW#wasThisHelpful","R3F9S9E8ROLJWK","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is of such a higher caliber than many of the M/M books I've read. It only skirts around a 5 star for personal preference, not-the-perfect-book/reader-matchup issues.I really appreciated the two real, flawed, but surviving main characters. I liked the larger than life side characters too. Cousins used repetition to highlight Tom's obsessive thinking and his anxiety level was instantly recognizable. Similarly, Reece's coping mechanisms were believable. I liked how hard the characters had to work for their happiness and I really loved Toms need to make 'this one thing' work out and be right and good for someone. It was both utterly selfish and completely generous at the same time and the dichotomy of it was delicious. I The writing and humor is also excellent.I did think that a couple major problems were solved with questionable ease toward the end and I was almost offended with how easily the second largest issue on Tom's list of fears was just swept away. (Though I do see what the author was doing there.) But these are small complaints in the grand scheme of things. Really a great read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22XR4TWMMIU4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOM4IM2#wasThisHelpful","R22XR4TWMMIU4Y","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an amusing, if somewhat shallow read. It's action packed and never seemed to lag, despite being quite long. So, my main take-away is that I had fun with it. But that doesn't really negate the fact that the characters were not fleshed out; not one of them had any history at all. The romance came out of nowhere and was wholly unsupported. Plus, there was absolutely no chemistry between the characters, even if I did like them both and liked them together. The point of view was inconsistent and a random enemy showed up at about 60% through, but never really did anything.Anyhow, it was an enjoyable read. And though it could use a little more editing, the writing was quite readable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JY32VQN76KJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PSPG6NM#wasThisHelpful","R2JY32VQN76KJC","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*mild spoiler alert*This was a pretty middle of the road read for me, even if I don't factor in being burned out on YA.Actually, lets do factor the YA in for a minute; not me being burned on it, but that the character was supposed to be 15. I found this extremely unbelievable and many, many times throughout the book had to remind myself of it because I kept forgetting. Let's just list some of the reasons, shall we? And we'll skip the mystical or paranormal ones.1) She takes a boat and successfully navigates and sails to Bermuda, stopping and berthing the boat at various marinas along the way. Apparently, no one thought it odd that she be on her own.2) She walks into a pawn shop in a country she's never been in and doesn't speak the language and pawns a handful of pearls for an appropriate amount of money, meaning she knew the value of said pearls and not only how to pawn them, but how to get the owner to giver her dollars, not euros.3) She walks into a hotel and rents a room, no adult, passport or credit card needed. Again, without speaking the languages.4) She easily maps a route through Europe that necessitates trains, buses, ferries and taxis and uses all transport without trouble. Again, without speaking the languages.5) She rides all said transport, crossing several borders and no one bats an eyelash at two youths traveling alone. Same when she catches a plane home. Again, without speaking the languages or having a passport.Yeah, I had a little trouble keeping her age in mind. On a positive note, I did think the writing was good. There was an occasional tendency to over-use names during dialogue, but mostly it flowed pretty well.But like the age issue, I also had a problem with the book's timeline and geography. They swam, yes SWAM across the Atlantic ocean in a matter of days....DAYS...swimming...with her human arms and legs. From Bermuda to the Azores is roughly 2,225 miles, according to Google, and they swam that in a few days, navigating by who knows what and finding an island to sleep on each and every night. Um..............no. So, there was a fair bit of suspending belief needed to make this story work.There were also some character inconsistencies. Dylan seemed quite modern and aware of the world when he and Bren met, but about halfway through the book he seemed to lose a lot of that knowledge. Lastly, I was confused on the language issue, and not just how the pair traveled Europe. Why, for example, do merfolk (who speak several land languages) speak English between themselves?I do have to give the books props for being willing to challenge some engrained expectations though. I won't leave a spoiler on the biggest one, but a character acts just as you wouldn't expect and I liked that twist. There is a George R. R. Martin-like event that I didn't see coming and wouldn't have expected most authors to brave. Similarly, Varden provides no happy ending here, not even a happy for now. That takes guts in a writer and I appreciated that a lot.All-in-all, I had some major problems with this book, most of which could be overlooked with enough suspension of disbelief and none of them were enough to truly compromise my enjoyment of the story. Dedicated YA fans would probably enjoy it a lot more than me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37FTO2O8IF6T2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZMS13K#wasThisHelpful","R37FTO2O8IF6T2","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, first things first, as a point of information rather than part of the review: despite the cover, this is not a historical novel. With the exception of a rather lengthy flashback this has a contemporary setting. That surprised me. As did the fact that the story ends at 82%, the rest being a sneak-peak of another book.Moving on. I basically liked this but it felt insubstantial, at least the latter half did. It had a very strong start but then the pace picked up and everything happened too quickly and there developed a 'Darien can do anything without consequences feel' that just felt like poor structuring. The romance was almost instant, though I'm still not sure if this was a 'fated mate' scenario or just insta-love. There were mysteries left unsolved--why was Darien progressing in his change quicker than others, what was the friend's trip like, where was the Count from, what happened to Daniel, what's with the court titles anyway, etc.There were also some hinky sexual roles going on. I'll grant that I've been party to a few 'penetration politics' discussions lately, so maybe I'm just on the lookout for this, but I was greatly disturbed by the very clear association with bottoming and submitting or being submissive. Even when one character was described as a 'power bottom who's always in control' he was also described as a submissive for being the catcher. How is that being submissive? I get it with the wolves, sure, but this was general. And it was all complicated by how much topy-top-top Darien's personality changed once he decided he was willing to 'submit' to Albeus. At one point he (6 foot plus and over 200 pounds) really was carried up the stairs in a princess hold while he clung weepily to Albeus. That should tell you something.I did appreciate that the men were kind of like hipster bears. (Though Darien hated the term hipster.) But they were big and bearded, wore flannel and long johns and started youthful urban businesses. Hipsters. Either way, it was nice to see a different body type presented as sexy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FKPEI4N9ISHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GIMYH4#wasThisHelpful","R2FKPEI4N9ISHC","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DNF page 146I don't usually rate books I haven't finished, because I figure I can't judge it as a product. But I DNF this book because I was so not enjoying it, which is a pretty clear indication of it's worth/value to me. So, I'm dropping a rating on this bad boy.I literally couldn't take any more. I hung on as long as I could. I tried to at least make it to page 150, but even the four more pages seemed too much to bear. This is one of those books that makes me wonder about people who say getting published is hard (I know it really is, but stick with me) because this book is horrible and it found someone willing to publish it. The writing is stilted and simplistic. The plot is just another cookie-cutter vampire romp and there are so many familiar and over-used tropes that I seriously think I've read every single thing that happened so far in at least a dozen other books.There are so many elements of this book that, though familiar, drive me nuts.-The hetero-normative, traditionally beautiful woman (in this case skinny, with dramatic hair and big boobs) who talks about herself as if she isn't and can't figure out why men are paying attention to her and pretends no men have before. Yeah right.-The lusting over a man she actively dislikes and saying things like 'I guess my body didn't get the memo,' as if to suggest women have no control over their sexual urges.-Making out with a guy less than five minutes after almost getting raped by another. Sure, that's when most of us are feeling our most amorous.-A love triangle.-Fist person dialogue. Gah, WHY?-The single past lover who was sexually inadequate. (I bet if I kept reading I'd find out in the first sex scene that she never had an orgasim.)-Unnatural dialogue and unbelievable interactions between people-The constant internal monologue, that is overly focused on sex (as if it wouldn't be annoying enough on it's own)-The unrealistic teenagers-Insta-lust-You've been chosen, you're the chosen one-WORST OF ALL, the fact that this MC has had the existence of vampires irrefutably proven to her like 50 times and is still insisting that she doesn't believe in them and is acting as if they don't exist. It has totally undermined any credibility the book has. Plus, it means none of her reactions to things are believable either. She's too vapid and stupid to deserve any more of my attention.I could probably go on and I only read roughly half the book. Man, totally disappointed. I have not finishing a book. But I'm not punishing myself anymore.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9YDUREZ6LTL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933836237#wasThisHelpful","R9YDUREZ6LTL5","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would give this a 2.5 and I'd roll up reluctantly. I'd honestly like to roll down, but mechanically the book is fine. For me, that's just about the only thing I would say was fine.This book is action packed. It starts on the very first page and doesn't stop until the very last and I'm almost being literal when I say that. This book is ALL, let me repeat that, ALL running, fighting, attacking, being attacked, dismantling this mechanized beast, defeating that elemental wizard, shooting him, stabbing her, setting this baddie on fire, blowing that up, almost falling into that lava pit, narrowing avoiding being dashed on those rocks, skidding to a stop inches from this ledge, etc. It just never ever stop.And lets be honest, a book needs a little stopping on occasion. Character need time to discuss and grow (none did here). Plot needs non-fighting moments to progress (it really didn't here). You wouldn't think action could get boring, but in its repetition and exclusion of ANYTHING else it really did.Additionally, I found the villains' motivation flimsy (both the main one and the shadowy one). But beyond that I'd really like to rage a little about how often female villains' motivations come down to romantic rejection, as if that's our only available motivating force. Gah! Think larger people.The only saving grace was the occasional amusing quip and that I basically still like the characters. Though their tendency toward artificially rousing speeches and heartfelt thanks of each-other got a little saccharine and Kate's transformation from a ballsy 20-something to a coddling 'that's nice Dear' spouting mother was graceless and abrupt.Perhaps this is just third book syndrome and the series will improve, but at this point I think I might be tapping out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDJ11R5UHTCG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P54UVNW#wasThisHelpful","RDJ11R5UHTCG4","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There probably won't be much to this review, but that very lack of detail is as strong a sign of my opinion of this book as a 500 word essay would be. While there was nothing particularly wrong with it, structurally or literarily, there was also nothing in it that particularly appealed to me. I read it to finish it, but that's about it. At one point, I set it aside because I had house guests and didn't get to pick it up for several days. I had already all but forgotten it and it was an effort to make myself start it again.Mostly, I strongly disliked the main character, Ben. I know he grew throughout the narrative, but I still never came to like him. There were also a number of personal pet peeves that cropped up. There were a lot of television references, for example. I HATE this. You see, I don't own a television. I haven't sat down and watched a single television show in years. So, all those witty TV quotes and comparisons to series characters, I don't get them. My abhorrence of this isn't just not being in on the joke though. What I hate is the assumption that everyone will be.People also tended to have really idealized conversations that rubbed me the wrong way and struck me as incredibly unrealistic. The same could be said about the way Ben drew people into his family and then paraded them to all the rich and famous people's homes. Everyone was just so bloody accepting and accommodatinga bunch of polly-annas, one and all.  In the end it just started feeling cheesy.The dialogue also used names far, far, far too frequently for my tastes. And I thought the language in the sex scenes uncomfortable. Though, I will admit I thought the amount of play in the sex was appreciable.So, all in all, this book was a fail for me. I basically just found it clumsy in a lot of general, ill-defined ways. But I'm sure it would work for others.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FTEINRJU84W6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AC3D9LW#wasThisHelpful","R1FTEINRJU84W6","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've not read many 'Don't Read in the Closet' stories, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Plus, if I'm honest, I tend to avoid books less than 100 pages long. That's kind of my random,' I consider this worth my time' length. But AJC posted a teaser of this somewhere and it did its job. It made me want the rest of the story. I'm glad of that  because I really quite enjoyed it.I love that it broke so many stereotypes. The rockstar who wasn't an alpha-Ahole, the sexually versatile Korean MC, the geek who gets the star. Plus, there was diversity in the cast, no unseemly penetration politics, and light D/s that was played instead of lived. Oh, and it was hot without resorting gratuitous sex.I did think Even felt almost psychic in how he so immediately knew what Riley wanted and needed, unless there were coded clues I missed, there were no hints. The ending also seemed rushed. In fact, the rushing seemed to start with the change in narrative style at almost exactly 50%. But all in all, I had fun with it.On a side note: I love that cover. I do, it's awesome. But as much time as was spent describing the album cover, I wish that it could have been used.

"I was really nervous to pick this book up. In my little circle of the internet there has been a ton of hype about it and I've found myself disappointed more often than not with well-touted books. In this case, however, I'm thrilled to report that it lived up to its reputation. I basically loved it.Something about it struck me as very real, as if a lot of it could be drawn from the author's personal experiences. Of course, I have no idea if it can or has been. But that's the beauty of fiction, a good writer can make you believe it is, even when it's not.Another reviewer said the relationships in this book were, ""...so real in my experience of the gay community."" This isn't something I can speak to, not being part of that community. But certainly, as basic human relationships, I found them very believable. But there were other parts of it, parts that were so disturbingly familiar to me that I found them difficult to read at times.Example and true story: my grandmother kicked my mom out of the house at 13 and for several years, she (my mother) lived on the streets in NYC. I can only imagine what that was like and she pointedly doesn't talk about it. But my mother is an amazing example of dragging herself up from nothing to be somethingGED, college, nursing school, midwifery degree, FNP license, Functional Medicine license. She is basically amazing, as far as I'm concerned. And she hates her mother with the fiery passion you might expect given the circumstance.But at the end of Gma's life, when her husband/caretaker died and it was apparent that she was going to drink herself to death very quickly, my mother took her in. She converted a wing of her house, fed her, clothed her, monitored her vodka to keep her out of the hospital and didn't allow the woman's vitriol and accusations to drive her to violence. She swallowed her own distaste in order to do the right thing. And I saw so much of her and what it cost her emotionally to come home and take care of the woman who hadn't bothered to do the same for her as a child in Michael's situation with his father. Neither my grandmother, nor Michael's father had earned the right to be taken care of by their children. But family, even s***ty family, is family and sometimes it's not about what someone objectively deserves. Michael's whole home situation rang true to me.Similarly, I have a friend who ended up in rehab in her early twenties. I remember watching her decline, visiting her on her visitation day, facing the forced cheer and thinly varnished desperation of the place and being shocked at the youthfulness of the group as a whole. Again, Michael's experience felt recognizable.But as much as I loved the realism of Michael's situations (and Michael), it was Nunzio who sold the book for me. The way he WANTED without ever showing his desire outright. The way he was always there, waiting to be noticed, all without ever really pushing or demanding anything significant. You could see it in almost every little move her made, but it was amazingly un-intrusive. I loved him for that. My heart broke for what the time passed must have cost him, but he didn't play even a single 'woe is me' card. *Sigh* (I thought he was wonderful.)Then there is the sex! I wouldn't call this an erotic novel, though the sex is definitely erotic. It's hot, really hot and there was plenty of it, but it's there as part of the plot not as a distraction to it or in excess of it.There were aspects of the book I didn't like, but most of them come down to personal quibbles. For example, I'm not a fan of dirty talk during sex. Beforehand, sure, bring on the filthy suggestions. But any of the in flagrante delicto utterances always cheese me out. And my high school Spanish classes weren't enough to carry me through some of Michael's exclamations. I kept Google Translate open for the duration of the book.All in all, however, I'm impressed. I'd read the first In the Company of Shadows, which Hassell wrote with Ais. So, I knew there was a good chance that the writing would be good, since it is in ICoS. But with partnerships, you never can be sure who's done what. Hassell's solo writing seems to be wonderfully readable too. Plus, there is notable diversity in the characters. That makes me do a little happy dance.Side note: OMG, that cover!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DRETMN4178JW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HZYUEM#wasThisHelpful","R1DRETMN4178JW","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was charmed by Off Leash. I enjoyed Thomas' refusal to accept his given situation and insistence on doing the right thing. The magic was surprisingly well developed and there was an interesting and amusing set of characters that were largely more than shadows on the page.However, I thought that as hard as Thomas tried to get his human self back, we never fully came to grips with him. I never missed him as anything other than an idea.Further, I thought the plot took so long to become apparent that it felt non-existent. Let me clarify that. There is a plot, but it ties itself together at the end and up until the last few pages, when all the decisions Thomas makes throughout the book culminate, it just felt like he was running around randomly reacting to stimuli placed before him. It seemed a bit scattered.Lastly, I had little trouble placing the genre. It's fantasy certainly, and if it weren't for the cursing and oblique references to sex I'd call it Middle Grade Fantasy (especially with the illustrations that feel geared toward young readers) but there is cursing and references to sex (though not a lot), so...not MG despite feeling MG. The whole thing had a bit of a Terry Pratchett feel, in the sense that it's sometimes ridiculous just for the sake of ridiculousness. There were a few delicious ironies, humor and some very readable writing. So, if you like that sort of book, pick this one up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IACTDM33SUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011J9L5JA#wasThisHelpful","R1IACTDM33SUZ","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another sweet story from Megan Erickson. The writing was wonderful and I liked the characters, but this wasn't really my style. I sometimes have an issue with encountering mentally ill characters in books. Now, I love diverse representation and mental illness is real and should be represented. I'm not saying it shouldn't. Nor am I saying it should somehow be exempt from being usable material for fiction; or even that I won't enjoy a book with mental illness as a theme. But sometimes, sometimes I feel like it shows up as a prop or that authors write books involving it so that they can be congratulated on their inclusive, acceptance of those living with mental illness rather than because they have a story to tell that happens to have a character with an illness.I don't know that Erickson was doing this. I'm not gonna go guessing her motives about writing it. But I know that as I read the book, as much as I like Colin and Riley (and I did, Colin especially), I thought Riley's emotional collapse was so abrupt and Colin's reaction to it so stubbornly solid that I was left wondering if I should be taking more from the enjoyment of the story or from the lesson on the importance of getting appropriate help. It wasn't quite PSA level, but... Now, I did like that Erickson didn't have love fix everyone's problems. I appreciated that the men acknowledged that sometimes love really isn't enough.And this is probably just my issue, what I am conditioned to feel when reading books like this one. IDK. Because, like I said, it was well written and I did like the characters. I also liked how the book tied into the previous one, while still remaining a stand alone title (though, like the previous books and the blogs, I thought the emails felt gimmicky, even if it's the only POV you get from Riley). I'll definitely be reading more Erickson books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EPG99VWDC6T8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMGLXUC#wasThisHelpful","R1EPG99VWDC6T8","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh so marvelous! I was recently bemoaning the fact that I am so often disappointed in het romance book. In fact, I've largely given up reading them. Then someone described this book to me and I thought, 'well I have to try that don't I?'But before I do, I want to address that cover. It's a perfectly fine cover, but it doesn't give you a clue to the raucous characters you will find within it.  I'd never have picked it up had I not been given a very strong recommendation.Ok, with that out of the way, I loved Kit and the Duke. I just loved them. I loved the way she was so strong and he was so fragile. I just loved it. Now, another reviewer that I respect spoke to the fact that this is only just a reversal of male/female characteristics, not a true subversion of them. And I agree whole-heartedly. Really, it just highlights them in relief, which is still reinforcing them in a sense. But, experientially, I so enjoyed reading it that I'm going to overlook this fact.There was also a certain intensity to the writing that I just wanted to roll around in. It was lush, even if it did occasionally cut into clarity. Again, just the experience of submerging myself in it was diabolically wonderful.And (mild spoiler) as much as I loved that the happy ending came about almost entirely at the active, purposeful hand of Kit, I did think it was all a little too saccharinely perfect. She got her man, her title, her riches and her revenge. It was too much. But I'm still going to overlook that fact simply because I otherwise loved the book so much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DLLO3UO3QWZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMI1WIC#wasThisHelpful","R1DLLO3UO3QWZN","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, I give up. I'm gonna have to DNF this (50%). Perhaps this is a 'it's me, not the book' situation, but I don't know. I thought the writing was fine. It was a bit stiff. There is a distinct lack of contractions, even in dialogue and it just felt overly formal in general. I also noticed a few missing comma. But all in all the writing was passable. But at 50% we're still just basically running around without purpose (being picked up and taken care of by one man after another), clumsily hinting at romance and maybe a love triangle, and meeting new characters. (At 50%! I'm of the opinion that by halfway I should know the cast by now, so that the story can progress beyond introductions and histories.)

"Note: received a free pdf copy in exchange for an honest review.The first third of the book is explanation and discussion of how to use mandalas in meditation and how coloring can contribute to it, as well as a meanings-of-color chart. If this is the sort of thing you're interested in, you'll probably enjoy the affirmations and instructions. It was easily understandable and not too mystically off-putting.Then there are fifty mandalas of varying difficulties. Some with very small sections, that I would highly recommend keeping a pencil sharpener close for and can tell you a crayon would be too big to color with and some that by almost five-year-old easily challenged.I read the intro and then two daughters (~5 & 8),  my two mother-in-laws (both mid-sixties) and I (late 30s) sat down to get our zen on. I can't claim to have tried the formal meditations, but I did  find it calming to simply sit and color. It's something I loved as a child, but coloring in Princess Disney Whoever doesn't appeal in the least. This allowed for adult arty expression and I sank happily into the task.I appreciate the time and effort McClutheon obviously put into this project and if you're looking to get in on the new grown-up coloring trend (this really is apparently a thing) I have no hesitation about recommending this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A8XTP5YU00L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1514813858#wasThisHelpful","R3A8XTP5YU00L2","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won a copy of this book in a GR giveaway.3.5. This is one of those circumstances in which I really wish GR actually allowed half stars. I have to decide if I'm gonna round up or down. The book is better than others I've given 3 stars to, but I didn't like it 4 stars worth...Anyhow, I'm pretty 'meh' about The Golden City. I liked the writing. The editing was fine. Finding it set in Portugal was a change from the regular US/UK based fiction one normally finds (though I've seen others comment it wasn't accurate, I don't know one way or another) and Selkie, Otterfolk and Seria were outside the norm magical creatures.I even liked Oriana and Duilio. But I found them dull. Really, they seemed to exist in parallel plots that they then occasionally talked about. And they were so bound by social convention that there seemed to be no passion in them at all. And Oriana has to be the worst spy in history.The mystery seemed shaky. Almost 50 people disappear and no one notices? I mean sure, employers might be oblivious, but did none of these people have families or friends that might report them missing? The great magic that was supposed to happen seemed questionable at best, though even the book admits that. And it all seemed to fall apart for no real reason at all. Oriana was still walking around as if no one was after her, and it didn't seem anyone was despite claims to the contrary. Sure, Duilio dodged assassination attempts, but it's Oriana that's supposed to be in danger, but I never once felt that.And I was distinctly dissatisfied with the ending. It's not a solid HEA, which I don't always have to have, but it felt like something had been left incomplete. In fact, what it felt very much like was an obvious tie-in for a sequel, which irks me.All in all, I would call this OK, not great but not wholly bad either. I'd read a sequel if I came across it for free or could borrow it. But I doubt I'd spend money on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22DYKOZDBXXNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451417755#wasThisHelpful","R22DYKOZDBXXNT","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Can I just say how happy I am to be done with this book? I think it took me forever and a day to read it. It's not that it's a particularly bad book, but it was not to my tastes and frankly I was bored for most of it. The events alluded to in the synopsis don't really happen until the last quarter of the book and the child and his mother play a very small role in it. The rest is largely the day to day happenings of the logging camp.I enjoyed the loggers' uneducated observations about their bosses, but was less enamored with those bosses themselves. They were such intensely dislikable people (as they were meant to be). He was simply a snobbish product of his time. She, however, was a homicidal psychopath.All in all, probably a fine read for someone more inclined to enjoy the genre. I read it because my book club chose it this month. It's unlikely I would have picked it up otherwise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WXFJF55BBGRE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061470856#wasThisHelpful","R2WXFJF55BBGRE","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DNF 40%At 10% I wrote a Goodreads status update that echoed my thoughts from reading the book's synopsis. It said, ""I'm just gonna lay this out there right now. If it turns out that the whole 'Hank cheated' thing turns out to be a misunderstanding in which she ran off too soon to work out the truth (oops, sorry), I'm just gonna 1 star this sucker for the predictable, over used, insulting to women plot-line. Just sayin'""I only needed 35% to know. You can't get much more predictable than being able to pick the plot-twist from the synopsis and have it confirmed by 35%.

"Even richer than the movie, which was pretty rich. And I adored Inigo and Fezzik. How could you not? But I'm a reader who doesn't enjoy Historical Fiction as a genre because I can't always tell what's the Historical and what's the Fiction. (Drives me nuts). So, the fact that the author/narrator essentially eradicates the third wall, obscuring where the fiction and the author/narrator's supposedly real-life commentary split drove me up batty. (Yes, I realize it's essentially all fiction, but the effect is the same.) What's more I found it disruptive and not as endearing as I believe I was supposed to.

"Nope, I was not impressed, not at all. The bones of a good story were here. The writing is pretty good. The editing is un-noteworthy, meaning it didn't grab my attention, which is what you want in editing. But there my praise mostly ends. Yes, I'll concede that Raven was sassy and determined to remain independent. Both of which are good qualities, too bad they're completely undermined at every single stage of the book. Every-time she attempted independent action she ended up in trouble, needing rescue.She's obstinate to the point of ridiculousness. Well past the point when the truth is impossible to deny she's still denying it and insisting on going back to work, which is just stupid and suicidal. As is insisting she be allowed to go to the club when people are hunting and trying to kill her. It was so obviously only a chance to get her in a skimpy dress so he could ogle her and move the sex along that I actually cringed. But mostly it was just STSL.The sex was...oh, wow...bad. When she yelped indignantly, he pulled off her pants and put on a condom. Before she could sit up, he sat with his back against the headboard and pulled her over him to straddle his cock. That's her loosing her virginity and there is literally NO FOREPLAY (or hymen to deal with). All of the sex is like that, abortive and un-erotic.There are also a few plot holes that, while maybe not large, annoyed me. First, she is so forgettable that her mother literally walked away and left her in a park at 1 day old. So, how did she manage to get raised in foster care? How did her Foster parents remember her? Second, if she is so dramatically forgettable how has she made it to 27 without noticing that this is something special? It's freakin' impossible. People forget her between one blink and the next, even when standing in front of her. But it did provide the perfect opportunity to show a woman as so stupid she doesn't even know about herself until a man (Cain) comes along and mansplains it to her. No thank you.Similarly, she is a Barbie. I don't mean her physical appearance. I mean the book is full of things she's never done, never experienced, never tried, etc. It's so prevalent that I finally decided she didn't really exist until Cain showed up to see her, because apparently she spent 27 years doing nothing.But worst of all, the whole this is bloody boring. Almost nothing happens. They play scrabble, talk and watch Lost (an unfortunate and dated media reference). Then nothing concludes or wraps up. As far as I'm concerned it might as well have been a series of random events with no beginning point and no end.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FWADGN523RPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I6HAUVI#wasThisHelpful","R2FWADGN523RPH","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I almost passed this one up because I find that cover so horrible. But it was on sale at Amazon yesterday and I love the Kate Daniels series, so I gave in and snagged it. I'm glad I did. Turns out the heroine is nowhere near the limpid fashionista that cover makes her look like. In fact, that cover presents the entirely wrong tone/feel for the whole novel. Thank goodness or I wouldn't have liked it anywhere near as much.Nevada is awesome. She held her own, kicked some serious butt and still felt like a woman. Rogan is an alpha's alpha type man and while he was an A-hole, I enjoyed his upfront jerkery. Together, however, the two were just freakin' hilarious. That's the main thing I appreciated about this book, the humor.Now, I did think there was an awful lot of, 'Oh, his manly, masculine maleness is sooo sexy.' *Rolls eyes* And, while I get that his moniker was Mad Rogan, it felt really strange to hear him introducing himself by that name, as if Mad was his first name. Lastly, the epilogue felt really contrived.

"It took me a full 120 pages to finally get truly interested in this book. It's jut so very slow. Now, it's meant to be. It's about a dying old woman who, while writing a fictional story, is contemplated her life. From the very beginning there was a lot to think about, but I was honestly bored. However, once Hime becomes human things pick up a little...or maybe I had finally just adjusted to the slow pace.But once I got past the slow pace, I was really impressed with this as a contemplation on placethe idea of one's social place, place as a physical location and the intersection of these ideas that construct our sense of ourselves (Fudoki). Harueme is a princessdaughter, grandaughter, sister and aunt to emperors. But this same high rank (place in society) is a prison of sort, keeping her in her place dreaming of being free, of seeing the world and new places. She is never allowed to escape her place, physical or cultural. While simultaneously, Hime is a cat who has lost her Fudoki, her place and therefore the sense and understand of self that it provided. She spends the whole book looking for a place to be her and her own.If you're looking for a contemplative read and have any interest in 11th century Japanese culture I recommend picking this one up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DGV4S94UWQ7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OS3BDG#wasThisHelpful","R3DGV4S94UWQ7B","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you could see me, I'd be holding my hand up and rocking it back and forwards in a see-saw movement meaning, so-so. I thought the writing was simplistic, but good. The characters had distinct voices. The editing was clean. The idea was interesting and the authors balanced an impressive numbers of threads that look to be weaving together eventually. An impressive feet when you're covering over 100 years.However, we're all individual readers and we all have literary qualities we do and don't like. For me two things I'm not hugely fond of is vignettes and leaping back and forwards in time. Unfortunately, that is exactly what this book is. It's set up so that you follow three primary character arcs in three different eras. What's more, we were given very brief snippets, sometimes only a page or two for each one before leaping briefly to another and so on.I can see what the authors were going for with this narrative choice. It was like getting little tastes of something larger. But, for me, it resulted in not being able to sink into the story, as I was always yanked back out with the changing focus.Similarly, I'm not sure I followed the need for this to be written in episodes. (Unless it was originally written as a serial or something.) The overall impression I was givenfrom the too-brief chunks of character POVs, having the story broken into episodes and the unusually large number of new, or previously unimportant, characters being introduced late in the bookwas that of disconnection. Like these are all puzzle pieces, but they're all still in the box, yet to be put together.I did think a few of the characters were a little heavy on their character's characteristic. They were almost caricatures of their type of personthe rich playboy who doesn't know the value of money, the cajun bayou man, etc. And I have to admit I thought the pictures felt a little gimmicky.Lastly, for those to whom such things matter, there does seem to be a religious, or at least spiritual, theme being established in the storyline.All in all, an interesting read that I think will appeal to the right reader.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RECLHRHT10V3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990751813#wasThisHelpful","RECLHRHT10V3X","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is probably a must-read for all Anime and Manga fans out there. Youll definitely recognize the feel of it. Not to mention itd be really helpful to already understand what a yokai and oni are, as well as any number of other recognizable Japanese words (clothing items, ranks, weaponry, etc).I basically enjoyed it after a really slow start. I enjoyed Yukiko and Buruu, as well as some of the side characters. I probably could have done without the teenage romance, but this is a YA book so I dont know that I can really complain about it.Like so many YA books it is essentially an allegory. Shimas Chi dependence mirroring the modern worlds dependence on oil and its destructive self-perpetuation.

"I thought this was ok. There were things I liked, like Jessica's insistence on independence and the way Rourke went all desperate and weak-kneed at toward the end, not to mention needing rescue. But while I found the latter half of this amusing and would read more of the series, I wasn't overly impressed.One of my number one dialogue pet peeves is when characters say each-other's name all the time. Think on it; if you're having a conversation with someone, especially if it's just the two of you alone, how often do you say their name? Maybe once, in the beginning to get their attention, if even then. In this book these characters used a direct address or name in almost every interaction, sometimes multiple times in the same brief conversation. It drove me absolutely crazy. It just feels so very unnatural.There is non-stop action in this book and, while action is good, it prevents boredom, there is no downtime in this book and I think it needed some. The characters needed a breather here or there, so that the reader could take a moment to digest. You're never given any time for big reveals to settle before the book whizzes off to something else, denying the moment any gravitas.It's also a cliffhanger. True, it's not a precipitous as some of them I've encountered and I don't mind some open threads to carry over into a next book, but nothing really wraps up in the story, which annoys me in general, but is especially annoying when the ebook is $8.99 (a new paperback is only $5.20), as it is as of the time of posting this. Seems a little expensive for just part of a story, and that's honestly all this is.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12IIAHJQQALAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00578CPA8#wasThisHelpful","R12IIAHJQQALAV","AUF0OPKICU6D4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUF0OPKICU6D4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This author, Cynthia Eden, does an outstanding job of describing the feelings of romantic love!

The doctors say she has dissociative amnesia.  Eve learns of L.O.S.T., Last Option Search Team, and goes to their office and begs Gabe Spencer to help her figure out who she is....she's hoping that will lead to getting her memory back.

"This is a well-written, complex, and interesting romantic suspense; it is somewhat predictable, but that does not take away from an excellent story.  The Rivera Cartel is horrifically violent and looks like they have someone in the United States helping them with drugs, weapons, and sex trafficking.  The ATF Agents Boyd and Roberts are getting help from an Ex Ops Team who specialize in ""hostage rescue, high target bodyguards, and security"".The love story is amazing! Hot, Hot, and more Hot.

She's a chef who is determined to make the restaurant vegetarian with a smoothie bar.  She meets a rancher, Jonas, who is a former soldier with injuries that have scarred him emotionally and physically.  He's rugged and strong but it seems many women have made him feel less that a man because of the scars.

The strong thread of patriotism, excellent imagination and writing, full-bodied Alpha men, and a storyline that is not predictable are just some of the reasons!  In ""Disavowed"" Cal Stokes and his team, known as ""The Jefferson Group"", are a virtually secret group of former soldiers and other specialists ready to fight people who threaten the United States, or rescue hostages in foreign lands.  The team, Trent, Gaucho, Neil Patel, Daniel Briggs, to name a few, are memorable, well-described characters.  In this story, a friend of Cal's, Andy, is on a mission for the CIA in Afghanistan when he is severely injured and kidnapped by terrorists.  He manages to get one partial message for help to Cal.

"""Fallen"" is a sometime sad, but fascinating story of Daniel Briggs! At this point in his life he is just roaming the countryside, (like Jack Reacher, the main character in books by Lee Child.)  This author, C. G. Cooper, is a better writer, not predictable, and his characters are strong Alpha men, not quite as messed up as Reacher.  Although in this story, Daniel is really messed up with guilt and angst from being a decorated Marine in Afghanistan and other places.  He gets off the train in a small town to eat and wrestles with getting back on the train or ""playing"" with suicide.  He doesn't do either; he meets some interesting people and gets embroiled in their problems.

"In Alabama, Wilson Hilliard is dying.  His friend and associate, Bernard, has helped keep him alive long enough to see some vengeance against a group of men who Wilson feels have wronged him.  We again meet Jess and Dan, who are now married and expecting a baby.  Dan is the Chief of Police and Jess is the Deputy Chief of Major Crimes.  Sylvia, the Coroner, is falling in love with Buddy, a local P.I.  When men start dying in bizarre ways, Jess and Lori have to find the killer, hopefully before Jess gives birth.  This is an interesting romantic suspense, but we never really learn what horrible deed these men have done to Wilson to deserve to be murdered.  Maybe the next book in the series will clarify this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBFW4K8L0IBYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCAWQEC#wasThisHelpful","RBFW4K8L0IBYA","A1SKQ5W90YXHF4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SKQ5W90YXHF4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first of Michael Prescott's books with Abby Sinclair as a main character.  She is a fascinating character, a hunter of stalkers.  Abby is a singular person, preferring to be alone and work alone.  She has a Masters in Psychology and trained for years to learn how to act, how to fight, and is technologically savvy.  Working with the Travis Protective Services, an investigative and bodyguard service, Abby does up close and personal threat assessment of stalkers.  This story is fast moving, exciting, and has lots of surprises.  The writing is, as usual with this author, crisp and imaginative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NXI15WIQZ2F9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081S9OUA#wasThisHelpful","R3NXI15WIQZ2F9","A1SKQ5W90YXHF4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SKQ5W90YXHF4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Kendra Elliot at her best!!!  Excitement and romance mixed in with evil and more evil; this is a can't-put-down-until-finished story!  A small plane transporting a ferocious serial killer crashes in winter in the Cascades.  As luck would have it, the only survivor is Darrin, the serial killer.  A ""hasty team"" is sent out for search and rescue.  There is a nurse, a former Marshall, 3 other cops/search and rescue types and a wonderful large dog!  There are many surprises and twists and turns.

"I'm a little surprised by the many 5 star reviews for this series co-written by Melinds Leigh and Kendra Elliot, both excellent authors.  The story is good and the mystery and romance that run thru the series are interesting.  But, as I read the novellas, I realize I'm feeling these are not the usual high quality I see from both authors.  I think it is because these 'novellas' should just be one book, in my opinion.  Book 3 highlights the relationship between Zane and Stevie, Carly's sister.  The drug problem in this area in Oregon is still killing people and the police have no idea who is manufacturing 'C-22'.  In Book 1, Bill Taylor dies of an apparent heart attack; in this book we find out he was probably murdered.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKZ72I377P85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV4HZFM#wasThisHelpful","R1YKZ72I377P85","A1SKQ5W90YXHF4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SKQ5W90YXHF4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Seth and Carly are separated; but their lives intertwine when a dangerous drug is being sold in their area.  This is a fast moving novella, and interesting.  This is, however, Book 2 of 4, all roughly the same size, and all about this small town area in Oregon.

This is a complex, engrossing, and thrilling story of not just one vigilante, but a whole group of government sanctioned vigilantes.  They are called ""Discreet Activities Covert Team.""

"Loved it. Just finished the series today. The only complaint I have is the ending. The ending isn't bad, mind you. It's just that I expected more. I think probably it all depends on whether they continue the series.I like that it can show violence without it being overly graphic. I mean, there is blood, but we're not talking anything worse than you'd see on regular television. There is slight nudity, but in only two episodes. The main thing here is the story. It's driven, you'll find yourself holding your breath and oddly enough, seeing the perspective for even the bad guys.It is what it said it is. Imagine if we lost WWII and if both Japan's and Germany's ideology continued on. Imagine if there were a treaty between them to bend certain rules, like Japan agreed to anti-semitism. This comes at the perfect time. A time of terror. A time where innocents die and we have to decide for ourselves what we're willing to sacrifice to stay free.On the lighter side, I think the scene stealer is the antique dealer. He is hilarious but still so cool. I would have liked to see more of him. The actor was simply amazing.I truly hope there will be a season 2.

"This is great and inexpensive. Granted, I question the legality of it all, but the NFL's price gouging makes this patch affordable. One tip though because I know this will come up eventually.

"I can't believe the reviews I'm seeing. This is not a body spray. It's basically water, with a small scent of something of which is a total mystery. My daughter is a lavender freak. I told her to close her eyes and I'd spray it on her and I wanted her to tell me what it smelled like. Her answer? Water. Yep, it smells more like water than it does like any scent at all. I could just put a few drops of essential oil into a bottle and add water to get an even better scent. No. I'm not kidding. Believe me, I wish I were.I'm so disappointed. I will never buy this again.

"I got the largest size and it still didn't fit my medium sized dog. Yes, the measurements are posted and mine fit the measurement for size 5, but she could get it past her toes. The depth is small and it doesn't list what that is. It's a really inexpensive set, so it may be worth it to go ahead an order set, to if it fits yours. In any case, these are for small dogs only. No mediums or anything.It ships from China, which I know is bad for some people. It does however tell you it will take a long time to get here, so that shouldn't surprise anyone buying them. Still, expect you to forget about them and then be surprised when you do receive them. Well, that's what happened to me.They're surprisingly well made for the price. I mean, the quality isn't Martha Stewart, but it is your simple standard. I was expecting something badly sewn and was pleasantly surprised when I got them, even if they were small. My daughter works for a vet and all of the employees have dogs, so she took them to work to give them to someone who wanted them.All in all, it's a great deal if you have a small dog.

This could be a better book if they would simply reformat it and make an active TOC.Grimm's Fairy TalesThis edition has an ATOC but no other special features such as an intro, biographies nor any illustrations. It is simply bare bones prose.This version is similar to the one above in that it has single spaced paragraphs, but thankfully each paragraph has an indentation so it is easy to spot new paragraphs. I do like the text formatting better than the one above. It highlights rhymes very well.It's main downfall is that it too only contains 62 of the original 211 stories.This one also only gets 3-stars. There is no feature here that is all that worthy. You're missing most of the stories and you get no extras.Grimm's (Complete) Fairy Tales (Annotated)This edition has an ATOC, introduction and biographies of the brothers. It however does not have any illustrations, sadly. That would make it near perfect, except for the annotated thing, which I'll come back to.This edition is the most exhaustive of the three. It has 210 of the original 211 stories, which means if you want all the stories, this is the book for you. Most of its text formatting is better than the others as well. Paragraphs are double spaced, but the thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't highlight rhymes like the previous version.The one very serious problem I have with it is its claim of being annotated, when it very clearly is not. There's not a single annotation throughout the book. I'm not sure why they claim it to be so. Perhaps the print edition is annotated? In any case, I can say with the utmost authority that the Kindle edition is definitely not. What a disappointment!This one gets 4-stars simply because it does contain all of the stories. It looks like one story may be missing (I'm not going to go through all 211 to see which it is, but it could be that one was combined or a number was missed. Either way, it's the most complete version.---All in all the one I find most useful (so far), even if it's lacking, is the so-called ""annotated"" version. If you're wanting illustrations, then I would get both that one and the first one. The second one is, in my opinion, the least useful.The truth is that at the time of this writing there is not yet a perfect edition in Kindle. Perhaps one day. If you find one (that is low priced) let me know in the comments and I'll take a look at it.Hopefully this helped you in your choice. If not, please let me know how I can improve it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXFRXB7VWS2NR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LDYMPIW#wasThisHelpful","RXFRXB7VWS2NR","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I see plenty of complaints of formatting and picture size, but perhaps those were previous versions. Whomever formatted the book can upload updates. I believe a number of older reviews probably had earlier editions. The one thing Amazon needs to be sure of is notifying customers of better editions.Though I have not checked rhyme-by-rhyme (I mean, there are just so many!) it appears to have each rhyme and every illustration from the original 1916 edition. I like to read illustrated books on my desktop (Kindle has a desktop app so you can do that) and the images appear to be large enough to see just fine. I would imagine on a smaller tablet, maybe not so much. For this reason, I recommend using a desktop for this book.The rhymes are well transcribed. I imagine that the text here was copied from Project Gutenberg, which offers Kindle editions for free. It is completely readable. I see a lot of complaints of only getting the first few sentences, but that is no longer the case. It could be that those users were unfamiliar with the original text and assumed that the two-line rhymes were incomplete, when in fact they actually were.The one thing that is definitely wrong, hence the 4-stars instead of the full 5, is that the text was centered throughout the book. That is the one thing that seriously irritates me to no end. The centeritis that floats throughout the world wide web. I cannot fathom why writers love it so much. It makes words appear more jumbled than they actually are and it is definitely not aesthetically pleasing, in my opinion. I hate it. It irks me because the author, Ms. Wright, published hers aligned most of the text to the left, but some with some in-between lines with an indent. Clearly, text alignment in the original was well thought out.Still, that is my only complaint. It's a great electronic edition and is a bargain for the price. I would like, however, to echo getting an additional hard copy for children too. They'll find it fun to look at.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LJ49DITZB8HO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C10SWM#wasThisHelpful","R2LJ49DITZB8HO","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a great game. I just finished all the Agatha Christie ones and that's been my entire hidden object experience until this one. I was really surprised at how different it was. As others have mentioned, there are two ways to play. I took the more laid back way. What surprised me most is that it's not just hidden objects. In fact, there really aren't all that many hidden object screens. The majority of the game has logic puzzles. I saw a lot of reviews mentioning ""puzzles"" but that didn't explain to me what kind of puzzles they were. Some are memory games, some are matching several shapes with other several shapes (it's a bit more challenging than it sounds), some are connecting different things by swapping tiles (sometimes wires, sometimes book covers), some are tracing lines by numbers with a total number not to be exceeded and some are creating shapes when the original is distorted. Those are just a few of the many types of puzzles there are.The story is strange and pagan based. It just wasn't all that compelling for me, but that's okay. The game part was fun, and that's what matters most. The one thing I didn't like were the way quests were organized. It's inside a large city and you slowly make your way through the city. I suppose you could say each level is a new part of the city. The thing is, you'll be on one side of town, then it'll tell you have to go to the X part of the city to find an object. You then have to go all the way back (it's like a maze) and then it has the nerve to tell you you now have to go to yet another part of the city. Couldn't they just give you a shopping list? I would say a large percentage of the game play time is going back and forth through the city and that annoyed me, which is why I've given it only the 4 stars. Had that not been an issue, then I would've given it 5.The graphics are okay. We're not talking HD now, but it's quite beautiful. I played it on my Win 7 laptop, but it did have moments of lagging. I don't think it's my computer because I didn't have this problem with the other games. I suspect that the main character does most (if not all) of the female voices, but even so, it's enjoyable.All in all, I do recommend it. It's definitely worth the $3 (for the download) that it is, at the time of this writing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2REGEMX09MHYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L45HS50#wasThisHelpful","R2REGEMX09MHYT","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will say that the liquid part of the product works wonderfully. It has some interesting ingredients (Water, Coco Betaine, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Glycerin, Honey,  Colloidal Oatmeal Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate) too. I put it on my dog and it really did help her itching.She has environmental allergies and is allergic to grass. Unfortunately grass is just something she will have to live with. I've tried a number of things. I even tried a canine cortisone spray but was aghast when I realized it had alcohol in it. Alcohol?! What moron put alcohol in an anti-inflammatory?! Poor thing. I tossed that one quickly.I really haven't found anything that truly helps (I've even Googled home remedies and tried so many of them). I have found that using this really does help her. The problem though is the sprayer. The sprayer doesn't work after one or two uses, so be prepared to pour into your own sprayer. For this reason it loses two stars. I have run into this problem before with other spray products and there is simply no excuse for it. Since it is a repeat offender, there is no reason this should be happening. Clearly, they're not testing their end product and that is bad business.I also want to say that the price here is too expensive. I got mine for about $6 at Petsmart. Check your local stores first. Just saying.===========Update: Just after posting this I contacted the manufacturer about the problem. Within one hour they responded saying they would send me another sprayer and I had it within two days. I have since upgraded this to 5 stars. It's entirely possible that this was just a defective item. If I don't post back, you'll know that the new sprayer worked.

"There is really only one thing I want from a cookbook: recipes. I don't care about the preaching on food safety or environmental concerns. Really. I don't. If I wanted a book on that, I'd buy it. What I want are recipes and just get to the recipes! This book resorts to this very fluff in order to fill the book.As for the recipes, I was very excited to see that this boasts recipes for all seasons. I was buying this because I'm taking a winter trip and would like to have a romantic winter picnic. I used to live in Alaska, so I'm not talking that kind, but this time it'll be in Socal and I live along the Gulf Coast. You see that winter weather here is more like Autumn for most.Anyway, I selected this book for its winter ideas. I was really disappointed to find that though this book does have a few all seasons recipes, they are very few. Summer has only 7% less than what Spring, Autumn and Winter have combined. I'm not talking about number of pages or recipes, but Kindle gives us percentages, so I'm talking percentage wise of each of those chapters.If you're wanting a frugal picnicking cookbook, then this is not the one for you. From Grilled Salmon Fillets to Artichoke Salad to Barbecued Butterflied Lamb, these are not for budget households. The foods are expensive, but they are also very elegant and upscale. As far as that is concerned, you have to decide for yourself which you prefer.Another thing is the amount of alcoholic drinks without substitutions is a problem for many. My ex couldn't drink any alcohol (he was an alcoholic) and I think because of my many years him, I just don't have a taste for it. Either way, it is disappointing that there were not some creative suggestions for drinks that didn't have alcohol. Obviously not all drinks have alcohol but each menu does suggest it and does not suggest an alternative.Now that's the bad. How about the good? The good is that the recipes do sound original (there are a few in there that aren't; like the chocolate chip cookie recipe -- I've made the same cookies for over 30 years and my kids, now grown, still act like children when they eat them). There are a lot of things in there that I had not thought about, as far as picnic foods. Many sound very good and I look forward to trying the high number of summer recipes provided. As mentioned above, there are a lot of elegant dishes so if you're out to impress someone, this is a good source.I have both a paperback copy and a Kindle version. I saw where someone complained about the Kindle version's format. The formatting is actually very good. The problem stems from the size of the Kindle. If you turn it where it's longer width-wise, it'll format much better. Also, turn off highlighting if you have it on. That often obscures part of what you're trying to read. Anyway, I don't usually use my cookbooks on my Kindle, but on my Kindle for PC, which makes it even easier to see. The one thing that I don't like about the Kindle is its lack of photos and illustrations. Gee, I guess I need to check my paperback because I can't remember if it has them or not. I won't say since I'm uncertain.All in all, it's helpful but not the book I was hoping it would be. The recipes do sound delicious and if that's all you're after (and money isn't an issue) then this is the book for you. If you're looking for recipes that are outside of Summer, then look into other books first and compare to this one. If you're on a budget, then skip it entirely.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K9B8HUEDT1P3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AOW5ZHC#wasThisHelpful","R3K9B8HUEDT1P3","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have this speaker that uses a cord and I'm very happy with it, but I was ready to move on to something cordless such as a bluetooth. I read the glowing reviews here and ordered it with trepidation. I've seen a lot of glowing reviews and then I get a piece of garbage, but I've also seen a lot of bad reviews and struck gold. You never really know sometimes.Anyway, it paired easily with my S2, but it did take a minute before it would show up. Once paired, I was amazed at its sound. I thought the sound on my other one was grand, but this is just unbelievable. It's designed so that you don't have to have two speakers. I see a lot of questions about using more than one, but it isn't necessary nor designed to do so.It gets quite loud and I have no static or shaking sound at all when it's fully turned up. The documentation says it'll last 4 hours via bluetooth and 12 via aux cord. Mine lasts longer, so far.  In any case, I was so impressed I bought 4 more and gave them out for Christmas this year. Every single one of them absolutely loved it! They were really impressed and one asked me if I spent a ton of money on it because of its quality.One thing to note. Of all of us, only one required a PIN number. The number is on the bottom of the speaker. It doesn't say ""PIN number"" but is a 4-digit number. It's also located on the bottom of the plastic jar-container as well.To be honest, I was really happy with my other speaker, but I am so happy I decided to upgrade.

"Not exactly the ideal set. At the time I bought this, I couldn't see the wheel very well and assumed wrongly, that it was serrated. It isn't. On the surface that sounds okay, but serrated works much better with tracing paper.I don't know why others are having pen trouble, but mine isn't dried up. My guess is that it's not really dried completely, but has retreated and needs to settle toward the top.One tip that may help with some of you is to store markers (pens as well) with the writing end facing downwards in a cup. Many turn it the other way, where the writing end is up. That actually dates back to leaky refillable pens, in breast pockets. Today though, you're less likely and besides, the cup won't matter so long as you're not using Grandmother's china. The problem with the upward issue is that the ink retreats backwards resulting either in what appears to be a dried up marker, or a pen that takes a few minutes to write.Usually, you can work that out by storing markers in cups with the writing end down and then the ink will move toward the writing end, dampening the tip. I'd let it sit like that overnight and then try it again. You may be surprised at how well it works after all!Anyway, I digress. All in all this is an okay set, but honestly had I realized the wheel wasn't serrated, I likely wouldn't have bought it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P893RO8HGK27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W5HNJY#wasThisHelpful","R2P893RO8HGK27","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I live in a first strike hurricane zone and to put it plainly, Katrina took off my roof. That said, as a child who grew up during the Cold War, I never expected to live past 30. I was sure that we'd be nuked. Then when Orson Welles warned us that Nostradamus predicted 1998 to be the end, I fully believed that it would be. It was all nonsense, yes, but here in my mid-forties now, I still have a nagging worry that something may happen. Not zombies, but something.All that said, my husband and I are looking to rely less and less on technology and more and more on ourselves and nature. My hope was that this book would be a good start in the right direction. It's too bad that it was disappointing.I have read that blistering review here that had some reasonable arguments and some not so much. For example, it is true that there are fire bans in certain parts of this country but in a serious disaster, police will be incapable of enforcing those bans during a serious crisis. Survival is key, despite fire bans. I'm not going to die because someone has banned fires.My problem however is with all the advice but at the same time all the secrets. For example she says (not exact words but you'll get the meaning) ""You can buy a certain manual washing machine for $60,"" and leaves it at that. A certain one? How do I find it? Where did she see it? We'll never know because she does not share any of her resources. I mean none of them.How many of us get books on hobbies and in the back it has a list of online stores where you can get supplies? This is supposed to be a book about disaster readiness and she doesn't have a list on where to obtain supplies. Really?I appreciate her efforts and there is indeed a lot of helpful information. I just think she needs to share a little more of her knowledge that she was unwilling to do for whatever reason. I seriously doubt product (or business) placement applies here, for the very reason those craft and hobby books ARE able to share their suggested suppliers.Perhaps this can be an addition in a future edition.

"I will have to agree with a couple of reviews here, so let me address those first.To begin with, I didn't buy mine here on Amazon. I was at Walmart and found them there. I was looking for a sandwich keeper that had a freezer container. I had previously bought this salad keeper (which I did buy here on Amazon) and I fell in absolute love with it. I wondered if I could find a similar container for sandwiches. When I was at Walmart, I remembered about it and looked for one. The thing is, it's cheaper at Walmart, much cheaper ($8.97).It's also true that this has absolutely too many lids. The top of the freezer tray is sectioned, so that the vegetable containers sit within those sections. Each separate sectional vegetable container (which again, sits in the top of the freezer tray) has a lid. Why? Why not separate the freezer tray from the vegetable container seat and use one lid to cover the sectional portion of the box? If they did it that way, there would only be 2 lids, but instead there are double that amount. Still, that's only two extra so it's not a horrible thing.This is still a great container, despite its shortcomings. The freezer gel stays frozen for a couple of hours without a cooler, and just about all day with one. It's great for picnics with the kids or whatever.I bought this small cooler and these freezer things. On errand days or days out, I just toss in the freezer things, my sandwich and some water, then I take off. This helps me avoid a run at a fast food place while I'm out and about.All pieces are dishwasher safe and all pieces are microwave safe, EXCEPT for the freezer tray. That's easy though because it doesn't need heating anyway.I sure wish they had these when I was still working. Why does all the cool stuff come out as I get older?========== UPDATE ==========I wanted to add a comment about the Sistema product someone else recommends. I personally don't see how it's better at all. Where is the freezer gel pack? What happens when you've rinsed your carrots and you put them in the container? Does it leak all over everything else, including your sandwich? It looks like it does. Then what if I want to have pudding and veggies at the same time?No. I don't like that one at all and now I'm rethinking my lid complaint. I could even put soup in one of the sectional containers and if it were all one piece, then it would spill into another section.Yep, this is definitely the better option... for me anyway.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NHQDTWGKX4TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSZJGII#wasThisHelpful","R1NHQDTWGKX4TK","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought the fuchsia dress (note that they have spelled the color wrong, as many do), to wear at the beach, over my swimsuit. It's absolutely adorable and would look great as a regular dress too, except that it's just a wee bit sheer. I would feel the need to wear a slip under it if I were to use it as a dress, but if you like sheer then you'll be okay. I also bought these shorts to wear under it too. They're cute together!It's soft and comfortable too. The fabric doesn't breathe well though, so on hot days it'll be sticky, but any spandex clothing would. It's too bad that spandex isn't breathable, like cotton. Woe is the earth on that score.I've seen where someone complained about it being cheap, but hey... you get what you pay for. Surely no one thinks they're going to get a Donna Karan for the price we're paying here, right? That said, don't expect to be using it with machinery. It IS sheer and it IS spandex so it will rip with sharp objects. Of course, most dresses would.If I had to list a complaint, it's probably the banded breast area. I'm rather buxom and so my girls are not fully covered by the band. For you well endowed women such as myself, go larger. You can always hem the bottom and take in the straps. That's one tip I wish I had known about.Other than that, I'm very pleased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O0NNQBXOF7EB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CH39CS4#wasThisHelpful","R1O0NNQBXOF7EB","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lovely scent! I was at Penney's today and bought mine. It is truly beautiful and has a soft scent. It isn't overpowering at all.I saw a review by someone who complained that you couldn't smell the vanilla. You're not really supposed to. Lavender by itself plain is a bit on the spicy side and is strong. Vanilla sort of relaxes the scent and tones it down. This perfume definitely qualifies for Lavender and Vanilla scent.I have worn Estee Lauder's ""Beautiful"" for 30 years, but now I have a new signature perfume and it is this one.

"According to Amazon, I bought this back in June of '10. Mine is still working for me, as though I bought yesterday. It was one of the best buys I've ever made, but I need to explain a couple of things.The manufacturer says to NOT use this with temperatures over 550. Most silicone mats cannot tolerate temperatures over 500, so I make my limit 475, just in case. It's a good idea to verify any temperature with an oven thermometer (this is the one I have) because not all ovens are made alike and sometimes the temperature fluctuates.It is easy to get clean. Everything pretty much slides right off. Occasionally there is something unusual that will be a little stubborn, but soaking it in warm soapy water usually does the trick with those. However, it IS dishwasher safe.Also, you can cut it if it's too big. There are some silicone mats that don't allow cutting, but this one is okay, according to the manufacturer (the link for the spec sheet is the first comment for this review).I see questions for gas ovens, but I wouldn't suggest it unless you contact the manufacturer. It's better to be safe than sorry.All in all I'm very pleased. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B9ZUVTIUCJRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HM8B9I#wasThisHelpful","R1B9ZUVTIUCJRV","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the Salmon 13.2-oz (at my local pet store, but will buy here in future) for my dog's monthly flea/heart prevention, which requires a meal when taken. She is allergic to just about anything and everything and also has a sensitive stomach. She's an 80 lb. dog and I give her 1/2 of a can before I give her the medication, then the remaining half after.The first time I gave it to her she danced around so happily you'd think I was giving her a prime rib fresh off the grill! She loved it and it's super healthy for her too. So now once a month she'll get this as a special treat. :)I sure wish I'd known about this. My elderly dog who died a couple of years ago may have lasted longer if I could have mixed this in his food. This is great for dogs who are sickly or whatnot.The important thing to know is that this shouldn't be their only food.

"I don't know what picture they had before, but the the board I got looks exactly like the board in the current picture. The size is perfect too and is standard for ribbon memo boards, that being 20-inches by 18-inches. There are coupled sawtooth picture hangers on the back so you can hang it lengthwise or widthwise and one large plastic hanger that you can use to hang on a hook. In other words, you can easily hang it any which way you want.Mine easily went up with a couple of Hercules hooks, that I borrowed from a friend. I have never tried them before now, but love them so much that I just ordered some for myself! In any case, unless you use a hook, you'll need two nails (or hangers or whatever) to hang it up.Below is how I hang it evenly, when I have no help. You see, coupled sawtooth hangers are often attached unevenly, which makes leveling difficult. I've been doing this for over 30 years (my husband was Army so we moved a lot and he was always gone, such as Gulf War I, etc.) and I figured out a trick that I wish I had figured out so much earlier, in my life. I will share it with you here.1. On a flat surface, turn the board over so that the back is facing up. Make sure that you are using the edge that you want to hang.2. Lay a long piece of paper over BOTH of the sawtooth hangers on the back edge. Note that a standard sheet will not be long enough, you can either tape together two sheets of paper, or use wax paper, parchment, etc. You just need to have it long enough to cover both.3. Do a pencil rubbing over each sawtooth. If you don't know what a pencil rubbing is, Google it. It's really easy but does require a pencil. Amazon won't allow me to post links so you can see what it is.4. Mark a dot under each rubbing, where your nail will go. That is, exactly the spot where the sawtooth hanger will land on your future, but presently imaginary, nail.5. Tape (use a mild adhesive tape, like cellophane, but not heavy duty such as duct tape) the paper on the wall. You can now move it around, until the line-up is right.6. Use a ruler to line up both dots that you drew below the hanger. If you have a leveler (they're cheap at Walmart) you can put that on top of your ruler, to ensure accuracy. Usually though, I just eyeball it.7. Nail your nails (or insert your hook if using the hooks I mentioned above) right through each dot on the paper.8. Once both are in, carefully tear the paper off the nail (I say carefully because sometimes smaller nails come right out with the paper) and then hang your board.Oh and during #6, you can alternatively draw a line connecting your dots and then use the leveler to line up the line when you tap it to the wall. Either way works.Good luck and hope this helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R124T0BTHGJ1EZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002U26HI#wasThisHelpful","R124T0BTHGJ1EZ","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that I initially bought this for two reasons.1. I would like to have my own chicken coop (very soon).2. Cookbooks are always a plus.I will say that I wish she had written more memoir-ish stuff, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. It seems that the actual focus of the book is on recipes, rather than memoirs, and that's too bad. I love animals and hearing about farm life (if you agree you simply HAVE to read James Herriot's All Creatures Great and Small series books). When I was a child, I visited my father's farm every summer and I hated it at the time. As a 6-year-old I saw it as a symbol of the divorce of my parents and I resented watching him with his new wife (who incidentally divorced him a number of years later). I surely wish now that I'd had a more open mind about the farm (not necessarily her), but I digress.Janice Cole's stories are sweet, amusing and highly informative. For example she sends a gentle, but strong, message that chickens need protein and should not be vegetarian. Yay for her, for not succumbing to what society wants to hear. I love that!The recipes are organized by what is in season. That is pure genius, in my opinion! It is always best to capitalize on what is plentiful. It's not only cheaper, but also healthier, because they're fresh. It's funny because I always categorized my recipes by name, or by type, or whatever (I use Living Cookbook 2013), but categorizing by season is simply brilliant! I may have to re-think my entire system.I own the Kindle edition, and I have to admit that I haven't noticed any formatting issues, which is a blessing in and of itself. Cookbooks are frequently victimized by Kindle formatting, but as far as I can tell this one has remarkably escaped from the evil-formatting curse.All in all I have to highly recommend this to anyone, if for no other reason than just simple fun and great food!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WQL5RYVG95F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZQZ8J8#wasThisHelpful","R1WQL5RYVG95F","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, this isn't going to be a review of what is included in the book. There are plenty of reviews that explain that. Mostly this review is going to focus on how it is presented. I am a stickler for organizing things in a simple yet logical way.Also let me say that I really wanted to love this book and very much wanted to be able to give it five stars, but unfortunately that is not going to be possible.I also was disappointed in the publisher not allowing us to search for the ""Look Inside"" feature. Many books will let you search and had I been able to search, I would have saved myself some money. This was a lesson learned. If you can't search it, then it's very likely that the publisher is afraid that you won't buy after you search.I just needed two things out of this book. My requirements seemed simple enough to me:1.  Tell me how much sodium and potassium were in foods.2.  List the foods I normally eat (I don't eat unusual foods)The problem is that I didn't think I needed to include this part:3.  Organize it where it would be easy to find what I am looking for.I suppose I should have made that a requirement too, because this book is a total fail on that part. I spend more time trying to figure out where the heck something is, than actually finding the answer.Let us use tomatoes, as an example. Where would you expect to find tomatoes? Technically it's a fruit, but if you go to the fruit section, you won't find it. Okay, so maybe its in the vegetable section? No, it's not really there either. Would you have guessed that it would be a vegetable sub-heading called ""Fruit (Seed-Containing) Vegetables""? I kid you not. We'll forget for a moment that there is no such thing as a ""fruit vegetable"" (it's either or, not both), but to assume that we would know to actually look for that type of sub-heading is simply madness.This means that most of the vegetables you are going to be looking for, could be under no less than 8 different ub-headings. EIGHT!!! You cannot simply open the book, turn to the Vegetable section and look something up. That's not how this book works, at all.Another example is the sub-heading ""Flower, Stem and Stalk Vegetables"". Really? I've never EVER heard the term ""stem vegetable"". There are plenty of city folks who have never even gardened before, in their life, so how would they know where to find their vegetables?I see no reason at all why the entire thing cannot be done alphabetically. If you go to look up a word in a dictionary, you don't expect to have to look up the word 'run' under a heading of Verbs, so why is this book organized in such a way? It doesn't make any sense.Then there is another problem with the entries too. You will not find bell peppers under ""peppers, bell"" nor ""bell peppers"". In fact, you'll not find any entry that has both those words (bell AND pepper) in them. You'll find a global word that says ""sweet peppers"" and in that order too. It's under Sweet, NOT Peppers. I use this example because it's an example of theirs on how to use this book. Normally I don't need to actually read instructions on reading a book, but this is definitely required reading for this one. Don't even try looking for ""blackeye peas"" because it's not under ""blackeye"" and it's not under ""peas"". It's under ""cowpeas"" and there are people out there who have no idea cowpeas and blackeye peas are one in the same.Let's talk about portion sizes. The title says very clearly ""Portions Commonly Used"". Really? I've yet to meet anyone who eats a single raw tomatillo. That's the nutritional information you get. The correct information is that they are ""commonly used"" boiled. They'll give you potatoes boiled and spinach boiled, so what's the deal with tomatillos? Then, what are 9 pieces of cilantro (I get that they are sprigs, but ...) and how would that figure in a ""bunch""? Most recipes call for chopped or bunches, but never ""pieces"". Calculating that would be next to impossible.Now my other gripe is about #2, which it also failed on. Imagine my surprise when I read that it has a ""dish cloth towel gourd"" but does NOT have ""poblano peppers"". It has ""jalapeno peppers"" and has even a ""Hungarian pepper"", but it has neither anaheim nor poblano peppers. Those are used in a lot of dishes here in America and I don't know about you, but I've yet to EVER see a recipe which includes the ""dish cloth towel gourd""! I am just dismayed at these entries.All in all, were it not that it carries meticulous information about some foods, this would get a single star. The information contained in this book, if you're lucky enough to find it, is valuable. For this reason, it gets two stars. Honestly, it probably deserves 3-stars but that would insinuate that it's actually a good book, which I believe I've demonstrated that it is not. Is its content useful? Yes. Can you easily use its content? No.Also, you may wish to know that a large part of this information is available for free at the USDA website.  Just Google ""National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference"". Granted, not all the information in this book is in the database, but I'd say most of it is.In the end, if there was another book that met all 3 needs above, then I'd warn against this one completely. How then could I say this is an okay book if I wouldn't recommend it against its competition? I've not found another book that does what this one does (yet). I surely hope that I will some day, or that they'll fix this one. For now, this is the best bet you have, but in the future check to be sure that there isn't another.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YUIEX69QQT8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0781781345#wasThisHelpful","R1YUIEX69QQT8C","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the DTP482 model and their official site (Component Design Northwest) has the manual available for pdf download, if anyone is interested. It's a decent unit for a decent price and so far I'm very pleased for the most part. I like that it does most of the thinking for me and that I can use it for hot oil and candy (so long as they are within the proper temperature range; less than 482F) as well as meats.That doesn't mean it doesn't come with a couple of annoyances; hence the 4-stars instead of 5. The first of which is the most important to me and is the eyestrain to read the small things, such as Meat Modes. For us forty-somethings and above, be prepared to have a magnifying glass handy or squint trying to hold it as far away as you can without a reflection. It would be nice if it were backlit, but it isn't.Problem two is the reflection. It has a very reflective surface so it's hard to read at times, even for you young people out there.All that said, it seems to function very well. Time will tell me how well it works, and we'll see. If I have any problems I'll be sure to update it here.It does come with some sort of a hook that the instructions don't mention at all, and a magnet you can attach to it. That's so you can just put it on your oven door. The only problem for me is that my oven door isn't metal. My oven vents are metal, but there is no way I'll put that thing on the vent. Needless to say, that stuff for me is useless.It still has a little stand on the back of it, so you can rest it on the counter or whatever.Finally, and I see many complaints (or questions) about this with other products. For me, I could care less but I know for a lot of you it makes it a big deal breaker. The device IS made in China.

"I was very pleased with this episode. The problem with documentaries such as this is time. There is a lot to be told in a short amount of time. If you want true in-depth information, then I recommend a book. However if you want a visual, and seeing people who lived through it, then this is the one you want.This documentary interviews several living survivors, which of course were children at the time of the pandemic. They share their memories, the loss of their family and friends, as well as their pain. There are photographs of overcrowded hospitals, reminiscent of the hospital scene in Gone With the Wind.One adult surviving victim recorded her tribulation and her writings describe the absolute pain and suffering she went through. I am a nurse and have worked for 23 years. She shared something that I had never even heard of, in all of those years. I had to look it up. I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say she went through 'hell on earth'.I do want to make a correction though. One reviewer wrote how the second wave was not at all mentioned, in this episode. That is incorrect because it most definitely was. It's important for me to say that because I'd hate for anyone to ignore this, thinking that were true. Perhaps the reviewer saw another documentary and confused it with this one (there is no verified purchase, so that seems likely). Anyway, I just wanted to make that point.All in all, this is a very moving, if not frightening, episode of the great American Experience series. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7QTMVPP4XUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EOTEM2#wasThisHelpful","R7QTMVPP4XUC","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had Book Collections until now. I used the other one until I couldn't stand it anymore. This one is a super improvement. I wrote some of this for the other review, but it definitely applies here because it is a comparison of them. Note that BC is the other one and C is this one.* BC requires you to either ""copy to"" or ""remove from"" each folder. C simply says Categories and you can check the ones you wish to use. That alone is much less tedious than BC.* BC requires you to keep selecting the book again after each edit, unlike C which is one edit only.* BC window automatically closes after editing a title instead of going back to the previous window, so if you want to edit more you have to go back to the beginning.* BC and C scans for books each time you want to download one (C even does it at startup which annoys me). I have a suggestion about that further down.* In BC when you're in a folder you cannot simply move a book (you can copy it and delete it, but you cannot move it). It snaps back to uncategorized then you have to move it. The way Categories words in C this isn't an issue.* In BC when you edit book information it is completely deleted once you copy it to another folder. That alone made me scream in frustration because not only was it not reading titles properly but it wasn't reading edits properly either.

"This is a glitchy app that still misses the most important function, open with bookmarks, highlights and location memory. It may be an Amazon issue and Amazon needs to get on the ball and fix the whole situation, if you ask me, but alas, that has yet to happen.I personally think Collections is a better choice. Note though that you must find the right app for your particular device. It's not a global app, which is good news for those who can't get this one working on your device. My review for that one is linked in the comments here.The quick problem is that this app is tedious and clunky. I'll offer more detail in a moment, but the other one I like better is quick and efficient. In my opinion, the other is a near-perfect app and I've nothing at all to do with the company that develops it.This is actually more of a comparison between this app and the other one. Note that BC is this one and C is the other one.* BC requires you to either ""copy to"" or ""remove from"" each folder. C simply says Categories and you can check the ones you wish to use. That alone is much less tedious than BC.* BC requires you to keep selecting the book again after each edit, unlike C which is one edit only.* BC window automatically closes after editing a title instead of going back to the previous window, so if you want to edit it you have to go back to the beginning.* BC and C scans for books each time you want to download one (C even does it at startup which annoys me). I have a suggestion about that further down.* In BC when you're in a folder you cannot simply move a book (you can copy it and delete it, but you cannot move it). It snaps back to uncategorized then you have to move it. The way Categories words in C this isn't an issue.* In BC when you edit book information it is completely deleted once you copy it to another folder. That alone made me scream in frustration because not only was it not reading titles properly but it wasn't reading edits properly either. C remembers the change.* Finally, for some reason BC is checking my ibirdpro information and I've yet to figure out why. That is rather disturbing, though ibirdpro isn't all that private, but the fact remains that it IS checking it when it starts up.What NEITHER BC or C have that is absolutely necessary:* Retention of location memory, bookmarks and highlights.

Bad BAD business.For all these reasons it gets two stars. It really deserves only one star, but it was the first book organizing app for Kindle Fire so that's at least notable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SPCRJPDY43LD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J0PZ8K#wasThisHelpful","R3SPCRJPDY43LD","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rarely do I absolutely hate a game. In fact, to date this is the only one I've ever actually hated.I downloaded the game because it was a bubble shoot (love those) AND because I believed what they said above about it having ""options for ... [the] timer"" and ""[a] settings screen..."".On the Kindle Fire there are no such things. I had my son look at it, just to make sure that I didn't miss anything and no surprise, he agrees. So let's go over all that it is lacking on Kindle Fire (I cannot speak for other devices).1. There are absolutely zero settings at all.2. There is no timer option. I wanted a timer option because I hate timers. I don't mind games that have them, so long as I can turn them off. I have a busy life and can't always just keep playing because the timer is going and the game won't stop.3. There is no way to get back to the game home screen (not the KF carousel, but game home screen). This is not to be confused with the KF's back button, that will do it, but the game itself has no option at all to get to its own home screen.4. There is no ability to pause the game, except to use the KF home button.For me, this game is a total fail all the way around. There is not one single thing about this game that I like and it is going to be permanently removed from my KF.If you have a Kindle Fire and don't mind timed games, not being able to pause it and not being to get back to its own home screen, then this game is for you. Otherwise, steer clear.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WBIXTGFOHOQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004O9G750#wasThisHelpful","R2WBIXTGFOHOQ9","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love bubble shoot games (I'm not an Angry Birds fan and prefer this type). This one is okay, but it's different than most. The goal for this one is not to simply clear the screen, but to gain more bubbles as you clear the screen.I'm not sure I agree with its shots. *Almost* always I can get between two bubbles to shoot the ones just above them, so long as it's not important to do so. If I *need* to get between two to bring down a large number of bubbles, it won't go through. This seems obviously fixed. Additionally, if you avoid a matched set of bubbles it will continuously give you that color bubble over and over and over again, but that never happens with colors I do need.I am a busy person and hate timed games, this one is thankfully not timed. I never can understand why we are forced for timed games. Those are a 'delete the game' for me. Not everyone has nothing to do but play games.It works fine on Kindle Fire EXCEPT that it's Save and Exit doesn't work properly. You have to either bring up the bottom Kindle Menu OR the top Settings Menu, then return to it and the Save and Exit will come up. Not sure about that glitch.Finally, I don't like that there is no level system, but I suppose that's because the goal is gaining bubbles. Still, it feels like I'm just in an infinite loops of going back to the beginning over and over and over again.All in all, I'll play it, but I don't particularly care about it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R167N8FB26GNN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IQ39AY#wasThisHelpful","R167N8FB26GNN4","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, this isn't a review for the TV show. Anyone with a brain knows that the show is a solid 10 on a scale of 1 to 5. My review is for this particular DVD set.The pro is that you can get all of series 1 and 2 as well as the Christmas Special for one low price. There are a few select extras without any commentaries and that is about all.I don't know if it's a manufacturing issue, or if all are made the same way, but I was exceptionally disappointed as I watched the show. All of series 1 and parts of series 2 have serious color issues. Everyone's faces look so pale and sickly with red splotches all over their skin. It looks like everyone has the measles.Now I will admit that I have a new blu-ray player (which I love). However, I do not have this problem with other blu-ray discs. On the other hand, I have a very limited number of blu-ray discs since I'm just now getting into the blu-ray world.I'm reminded of the quality of the Pride and Prejudice DVD set that I bought as soon as it was first released on regular DVD (post the VHS world). It too had color wash out issues.Also, I am so disappointed in the lack of blu-ray features in this set. For Christmas, my husband bought me this set along with the new blu-ray player. Maybe it was a bad set to start with, but it has such interesting features! One clever one is saving your favorite parts of the films. My assumption was that this was a standard, but perhaps not. Either way, I wish that a series so great as this one would have taken the time to infuse rich features like the Hitchcock set.It's worth noting too that if you purchase the separate series blu-rays (this one and this one), you'll likely (at present in any case) get a complimentary digital copy of the series via Amazon's Video Library. I actually bought them first, then cancelled those in lieu of this set. I'm very much regretting that decision now. This set does NOT come with a free video library copy.All in all, I'm gravely disappointed. Because it is a blu-ray I expected quality HD and that was what I did not get. The final disc worked fine, but not the others. Well, you get what you pay for, I guess.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XLGBZTMY02FB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HT4FUW#wasThisHelpful","R1XLGBZTMY02FB","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent book. The author (not the same Paul Newman that is a movie star) is clearly an expert on the subject of the middle ages. The pages are loaded with information that most of us would not even think about. It is clear and concise, and written in a very understandable way.Mr. Newman is very meticulous with every last detail. There are sketch examples of many things, but admittedly those are very few in comparison to its content. It is not simply about clothing, for example. It is about the dye for the clothing, the many cloths that were available (which were made in Europe vs those imported), who could afford which cloth (nobles vs peasants), how theses cloths were actually made and even how they made the thread or string that they sewed it with. That's only a very small part of the clothing chapter and there is just so much more. It's is an exhaustive encyclopedia, in my opinion. After reading this book, I feel like I earned an actual degree on the subject and you likely will too!Which brings me to what this book is not. This is not a stylized written book with a flair for words and rich content such as artwork or poetry. It is anything but that. Some reviewers have called his writing dull and boring, but even if I thought that were true, his writing does not make it any less informative. You wouldn't tell your professor that his lecture was boring because even if it were, it would still be information that you need to know. If you want to learn about the middle ages, then you must deal with whatever style it is. Sure, he is no great story teller, but there is no story to tell since this is a reference book after all.Now let's talk about the 4 stars. Why only 4 stars? I would have given it 5 stars until I read a comment (a comment in the Kindle edition extras) about not noting sources. I had not even noticed that, but the commenter was right. On the other hand, the introduction pretty much explains his credentials in that he has ""studied"" art and literature of the time. Unfortunately there is not much known about this author, except that he has written several non-fiction books about the middle ages (it's worth noting that at the time of this writing, the other books are not yet available on Kindle), so he appears to be knowledgeable. That said, the reader was absolutely correct though on his sources of information. They are not listed at all.I'm not saying that I don't trust his judgement or information, it's just that those who would like to learn more about the details Newman describes will be sorely disappointed. There is no way to know how he drew his conclusions. For this reason, and ONLY this reason, it gets 4-stars instead of 5.All in all, I highly recommend this book and look forward to the Kindle editions of his other books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BOBDFDV67XZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TUTVZO#wasThisHelpful","R2BOBDFDV67XZT","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very excited about this player, even though the reviews were love it or hate it. I like to think myself reasonable and will often give things a chance. It's too bad then that it didn't work out.The first one arrived and we happily plugged it in and hooked it up and turned it on. Hmmm. Nothing. The blue light said ON and the splash screen came up for about 1 or 2 seconds then it went black. Okay, well maybe we need to insert a disc, so we inserted the disc. It said loading. There was a lot of grinding noise and nothing ever came up. So we ejected and put another disc back in. Maybe it was the disc, though it shouldn't have been since it was brand spanking new. That didn't work either. Okay, so this was a dud.Being the patient people we are, we notified Amazon that we wanted to exchange it for another and waited for the exact same model to arrive (which by the way was thankfully a very simple process AND since I my original order had included an additional $4 for overnight shipping, Amazon sent the second model overnight as well).We got it early this morning and unfortunately, we experienced the exact same behaviors that the other one had. It too is a dud.Needless to say, I'm disappointed. Two different players with the same problem spells trouble. This time, I'm going to go with this one. When we bought the Toshiba, we paid $66 at the time and the Sony we're getting is a bit more ($88), but the reviews appear more solid and still does most of what this one does (not 3D though).","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O7GL4A93H63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007B5XQD0#wasThisHelpful","R2O7GL4A93H63","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Right out of the box, the TV refused to come on. I called the manufacturer, thinking we'd hooked something up wrong, but no. There should be a home screen if the power is on despite if anything is hooked up to it, according to tech support.He said he could send a replacement (he emailed me a form that I am not happy about because I have to fax it to him along with a copy of the invoice, this is an additional expense I shouldn't have to make) and then once I got the replacement I could send this one to him. While I was sitting there on the phone with him, the TV suddenly came on. Odd. We turned it back off and no surprise, it wouldn't come back on. About 10-15 minutes later it finally came on again. lol! It's the strangest thing. The tech guy said it should not take that long to warm up. He said he thought that maybe it would do that if it were about 40F, but one, it had been sitting in the house a couple of hours and two, we live in Mobile, Alabama. It rarely gets 40F and even more rarely that temp in November! It was in the 60s when it was delivered.So, we're leaving it on until the new set gets here. Now all that said, let me talk about its function. Keep in mind, this is obviously a defective TV set. When the new one comes, and I've no idea how long that will be, this may change.My non-HD Directv picture isn't all that great. In fact, I'd say it's slightly blurry. On the other hand, the HD picture from my son's games and the bluray and even Netflix are all amazingly clear. I think it's just time to upgrade my Directv receiver.I don't use the TV sound because I have a surround sound system. However, I will say that it works beautifully with even the oldest surround system known to mankind. Ours is a 1996 RCA, with RCA (red and white) plugs... I kid you not. It was top of the line in its day, but it is ancient now. Unlike our other TVs, this new one finally has an RCA out plug for old stereos. I couldn't believe it! That alone makes it worth its purchase, in my opinion.There is still a problem though. You would think that since the TV is putting OUT the sound, that it (TV) would control the volume it is sending out via the jacks, but nope, it doesn't. That means you'll have to use yet another remote, the one for your receiver. If I had one serious complaint, that would be it. Even my ancient rabbit ear TV would at least control the volume out via another source. I'm not sure why this one failed on that.It's very lightweight, has tons of plug options and even swivels. I really do like this TV. I just wish that it powered up better because were it not for that, I'd keep this one.The other thing is that I want you all to know that the tech support was very helpful. I called at 5:30 p.m. CDT and not only managed to get someone, but managed to get someone who speaks clearly and I didn't have to wait but less than 1 minute. I couldn't believe it. That is always a good sign. Also, he emailed me the forms and by the time I hung up and got to my desk, it was in my inbox. I love companies that treat you like a valued customer and this one did just that.All in all, I think it will be a good deal. If only it worked right out of the box and I wish I didn't have to go through the trouble of sending it back.The link to download the PDF manual is in the first comment under my review here.UPDATE: Just got the new set. I first contacted the manufacturer but I didn't like their exchange policy. I would have to fax (I don't have a fax) a copy of their form that they emailed to me and an invoice (which Amazon doesn't send with it) that I would have to print out from my Amazon account. Then I'd have to wait for their ship labels and once I got those, I would have to take the TV down to UPS or wherever. I ended up exchanging it with Amazon and they'll even send someone to pick it up. So much easier!Anyway, the new TV works like a dream. I'm very satisfied. It takes no more than 5 seconds to turn on. That was fresh out of the box. I'm not sure if there is a battery in there, but after being plugged in overnight, it came on instantly the next morning.All in all, I'm very satisfied but I do have to recommend some sort of external speaker system. It has a headphone jack, so if you can find external speakers that have that same jack, you may be able to use those.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IF2Q9DDMC99Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085WMATO#wasThisHelpful","R1IF2Q9DDMC99Q","A1N6712C6JHYJ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6712C6JHYJ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't buy these for the conventional purpose of using them as grocery bags. I bought them for my chest freezer and I am so glad I did!Having a chest freezer makes it nearly impossible to stay organized when it comes to freezer foods.

Figuring it wouldn't work, but I could use the bags anyway if it didn't I bought them.I am thrilled with them for this purpose! I can even color code them for foods. The other day my son was looking for hamburger patties I had put up. He asked me which bag they were in and I said ""the red one"" (red meat, get it? lol!) and he found it in 2 seconds flat.Now I know a lot of you are thinking my review is useless for you because you plan to use them grocery shopping. How wrong you are! What is notable about this is that with all that heavy frozen meat, all those frozen packages with sharp edging (yes, they get sharp when frozen) and so forth, they are strong and can handle it!These are very well made. I expect they will last for many years and they will wash very well.All in all, you can't go wrong with this. There are endless other ways to use them too.

"This showed up on a list of the funniest books of all time.  It is classic British humor involving the tales of 3 British male friends and a dog taking an extended boating/camping trip down the Thames.  The mix of content is about 50/50 on the events of the boat trip and their observations and commentary on the human experience.  The humor is seldom laugh out loud, but a mix of sarcastic insight into the foibles of modern (for that period) life and society and their travel travails.

"I moved to an older historic building (circa 1853) with very thick brick/masonry/lath and plaster interior walls.  The building has a ""whole building"" WiFi setup with routers on the first and 4th floors. My condo is on the second floor, immediately up the stairs from the first floor router and with pretty good line of sight placement for the WiFi signals.  In fact in the front portion of my unit the signal is great.  Unfortunately, I work from home and my office is in the rear of my unit - farthest from the router.  As a result, I was getting very weak signals on both my Mac desktop and my work Windows laptop.  I had an extender/adapter put in my front living room to boost the signal, but it didn't completely solve the problem. So after doing some research I tried one of these for my Mac (it plugs directly into the computer), did the setup (pretty straightforward) and was very pleased with the results.  My reception and signal strength is now ""very good"" - not excellent, but certainly good enough to make it painless to use my Mac.  It worked so well that I bought one for my work (Windows) computer as well.  However, the installation software comes on a CD and my Windows laptop doesn't have a CD/DVD player!!  So, after some head scratching, I put the CD in my Mac, copied the installation software to a USB drive, and put the USB drive into my laptop, and voila! it worked.Overall very satisfied, and the price was great and they even look nice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R201NN96JR69GC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006THNH7Q#wasThisHelpful","R201NN96JR69GC","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in the city, and street parking is the norm.  You walk down the street and see beautiful cars, then look at their bumpers - very sad.  ""Bumper Contact Parking"" (i.e. back up until you make contact with the car behind you) is the norm.  Although I have a parking garage space for my car, getting around town requires street parking.  So when I first moved here and saw all the bumpers ruined I started looking for bumper protection products on Amazon.  For the front of my car (a Mini Cooper) the license plate is/would be the first point of contact, so I bought one of those thick, rubber protective license plate covers (great reviews) to protect the front of my car.  After much research for a rear bumper protection product, I decided on the Pacer Performance strips for two reasons. One, the reviews were consistently outstanding. Second, most of the other products were far inferior in terms of providing protection.  These are heavy duty - I mean REALLY heavy duty. They are made out of hard rubber, very good quality, and between the two of them they cover the entire rear bumper of my Mini.You would think from looking at the product photo that they're more for protection than aesthetics, but once applied they really look cool and sporty - and boy do they protect your bumper.  One word of caution - be absolutely positive of your placement on your bumper (location and level) before you press even one small portion of the product on your car.  The car adhesive is extremely strong, and once you make contact you CANNOT remove it and if it is crooked (not level) or not in the right location - you're out of luck.  I went so far as to put a piece of masking tape below where I want them to go and checked it to ensure it was level, and THEN gently pressed one of the product on my car and worked from that end down to the other end.  There are two matching pieces.  The end result, again, is really attractive and no worries anymore about bumper scrapes and dings.  Highly recommend and would buy again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHEF7B2R4021N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00029X0XI#wasThisHelpful","RHEF7B2R4021N","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I appreciate authors that can write descriptive prose of scenery, settings, feelings, loneliness, and regret in language that literally seeps into your being, putting you in the same place and time as the character.  Per Petterson can do this, and do it well.  I understand the praise and critical success for this author and this book.  But ultimately, I need a book that has more of a plot - a storyline, and this one does not. It is written, in a manner a bit too long, of the observations, thoughts, and reflections of an old man and events that affected his life.  As a short novella it may have worked for me - the language is amazing, leaning towards Hemingway in long sentences echoing a stream of thought.  But as a novel - a book - it fell short of the mark.  I do not criticize other readers their 5 star reviews - the author is truly talented.  But my own taste runs a little counter to what the author offers.  I finished the book with mixed feelings. Glad to have the weariness of scene-setting over with, but also hoping, along the way, that a denouement would appear.

"I came across this book while reading an article on the ""10 funniest books of all time.""  Of course there are inevitable arguments about what should or should not be on that list, but the fact that I was ready for a humorous read after several excellent but depressing WWII novels, Wilt looked worth a try.  Briefly, Wilt is a career underachiever at the small Fenland College of Arts and Technology.  Continually passed over for promotions and pay increases, his life is on a dead end path consisting of teaching classes no one else will take to vocational students working in labor professions, i.e. butchers, bricklayers, etc. who are only attending because the government is covering their costs and it gets them out of work for a while. Wilt sleepwalks through these classes, having given up on trying to expose this underclass to literature at any level.  But, as it turns out later, his exposure to these rather rough but street smart and rather plain spoken (yes, there is sexual language) group actually prepares him for the travails he will undergo later in the book.His marriage to his wife Eva is equally dissatisfying. She is convinced he will never amount to anything - and frequently reminds of him of this shortcoming.  She envisions herself as an enlightened woman, constantly pursuing (but never sticking with) various yoga, meditation, and similar ""new age"" interests.  Wilt's life, in short, is dreary, repetitive, and wholly unsatisfying. One of his outlets, in a sort of ""Walter Mitty"" turn, is to take his dog for walks and not only dream of, but logically think out plans to get rid of Eva.  He sorts through various ideas, from poison to auto accidents to - whatever. They are more stress relief efforts; his desperate attempt to at least visualize a better life.The real story begins when Eva meets a new age couple, the Pringsheim's, Sally and Gaskell. They are unbearably pretentious and off the map sexually liberated. Eva is of course entranced, and Sally senses that Eva can be manipulated (sexually and otherwise), and as a result Wilt and Eva attend a party at the Pringsheim's house.  It involves nudity, crude language and acts (the only part of the book I found less than satisfying was the Pringsheim's - they are definitely ""not likable,"" but do serve as a good foil and plot device for the story).  It is at the party that Wilt, as a result of machinations by Sally Pringsheim, becomes 'attached' to an inflatable female sex doll, ""Judy.""  And the real story begins...Wilt ends up leaving the party to go home to find a way to ""unattach"" himself from the doll, while Eva ends up (liberal amounts of alcohol involved) leaving with the Pringsheims on a boating trip.  Wilt, not overly concerned about Eva's absence and unknown whereabouts, decides to use ""Judy"" as a means to practice his plans for getting rid of Eva.  This leads to ""Judy"" ending up at the bottom of a construction hole at Fenland College, and Wilt being investigated for the murder of Eva.  His adversary is Inspector Flint.  The remainder of the book focuses on his conversations with Inspector Flint and others in their efforts to get him to confess to Eva's murder.The interaction between Wilt and Inspector Flint (and his other police peers) is hilarious. The satire is marvelous and entertaining.  The interesting part is that Wilt, a career sub-achiever, finally comes into his own.  He knows he is innocent, and as the investigation goes on (filled with endless police mixups, wrong assumptions, and an exasperating inability to break down Wilt), Wilt gains confidence and a sense of self worth for the first time in his life.The ending, as is the entire book, is entirely satisfying and appropriate.  This is inimitable British satire, done well.  Aside from the off-putting Pringsheims, the characters are well drawn (in a caricature manner) and the central humor, again, is the bumbling police vs. the suddenly inimitable Wilt. I laughed a lot throughout, and think you will as well. It is a light read, and a good break from reading ""heavy"" novels.  I wouldn't put it in the class of Wodehouse, but it certainly does have elements of his writing style. Read it and enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MUTWA9IHEF26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051UPLC6#wasThisHelpful","R2MUTWA9IHEF26","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great ""light"" read.  Basically it's a career frustrated, cynical college English professor writing a never-ending litany of 'Letters of Reference' (""LORs"").  The laugh out loud part is he can't resist going the ""too much information"" route.  Yes, a lot of them are similar, but the length of the book, the variety of addressees and topics, and his ever-increasing inability to simply ""stop, you've said enough"" make it very enjoyable.

"I didn't like this book, but finished it anyway.  I had read one previous by the same author, and it was marvelous, so I know she can write.  And that writing talent shows in this book as well. But the plot, storyline, structure, and characters are unbelievable, unlikable (for the most part), and undeveloped.  As other reviewers have noted, she uses the (gaining popularity) method of jumping from one character's narrative perspective to another. The result breaks the flow and frankly is a mess - you're just beginning to get engrossed in one storyline and perspective, and then it changes to another character.  Alice and her Husband are unlikable - Alice has terrible judgment for being such a 'smart' woman, and her husband is a nut case.  Jenna, her left behind daughter (there's a pun in that line re the ending) is unbelievably precocious for a 13 year old. I could go on, but trust me the other characters are thinly developed and don't add much to the plot - you even tend to forget who is who. Some criticize (mildly) the Elephant angle.  I liked it, but then again, I am fascinated by Elephant behavior.  If you REALLY want to read a wonderful book on the subject read ""Elephant Company,"" a true story based on one Englishman's life in Burma working for a Teak company where Elephants were the lifeblood of the industry from the early 1900's through the second world war.  This book barely touches the surfaces of Elephant behavior.  Read 'Elephant Company' (a great story as well) and you'll fall in love with Elephants forevermore.  I can't recommend this book, and I will be more careful regarding ready Jodi Picoult in future - i.e. download a sample.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQTMOT5H5MVB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXYKYIE#wasThisHelpful","RQTMOT5H5MVB8","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Liane Moriarty is one of my favorite authors.  I read ""The Husband's Secret,"" which prompted me to read ""Big Little Lies,"" (which in my opinion is her best novel, soon to be a movie with Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon), and now ""What Alice Forgot.""  Liane has the ability to make her characters so vivid they literally jump off the page.  Her dialogue is wicked good, interspersing humor, angst, and the highs and lows of everyday life in a ""I wish I could write like that"" result.  That talent and ability is what saves this novel.  It has some weaknesses in plot, construction, and believability, but somehow her brilliant words on the page keep you up late at night.  Other reviewers reveal the plot - Alice loses her memory of 10 years spanning age 29 to 39 - she can remember nothing of that period, not even her children's names or the fact that she even HAS children.  As she slowly discovers, primarily though interactions with friends and family, what has transpired over the last 10 years she's amazed. She finds that she has changed from a young, sort of ""whatever"" person to a driven ""super mom"" who is a 24/7 dynamo in everything from social activities to personal health  - in other words, the complete opposite of the young Alice.  Oh, and her Husband Nick is divorcing her. And her children don't really like her.  I could go on.  While this is an interesting plot device, it really stretches the bounds of believability.  Also, in terms of construction, the author inserts lengthy ""diary"" type entries by Alice's sister and her grandmother.  Frankly, they get in the way of the story, and made it about 100 pages longer than it needed to be.  I found myself going ""oh no"" when I saw one coming up, know the next several pages would be the meandering thoughts and musings of the aforesaid relatives.  In my opinion it was distracting.  In believability, the sheer fact that both Alice and her Husband changed so completely, and then in some ways (after her memory came back) reverted to their younger selves was, well, I don't know...hard to accept.But, having said all of that, I couldn't put it down.  Liane Moriarty is that good of a writer.  And I will continue to read her books.  She is able to take an amazing cast of characters (it usually takes me about 30 pages to figure out who's who) and spin a tale that is both provocative and fun read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B7QLTB1L0PLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XFYN9M#wasThisHelpful","R1B7QLTB1L0PLV","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this for my wife - who admittedly has a weakness for the latest exercise gadgets. But to her credit, she uses them all, and the few that don't meet her standard are swiftly carried off to be donated to the thrift store.  I read reviews before buying this, and they were mixed.  All reviews cited the good workout, but some talked highly of the quality, while others described it as ""cheaply made.""  After receiving it and putting it together (amazingly easy - you can do it in 15 minutes - don't go looking in the box for all the listed bolts and screws - they're already installed) I was impressed with the heft and quality of the pieces.  My only observation less than 100% positive is that, while there is no danger of it tipping over, it is not 100% stable (by that I mean ""motionless"") on carpet.  It needs a solid floor, but it will in fact work on carpet.  It is fully adjustable (the height of the upper handles can be raised or lowered), although there is no resistance setting - but for this type of machine you don't really need one.  If you want a more strenuous workout just lengthen your steps (all the way to the bottom vice halfway down) while using it. The little clock/timer is worthless, but my wife doesn't need it.  The grips, foot pads, and frame are all impressive. She loves it.  Plus it folds up neatly to be stored in a closet or unobtrusively against the wall.

"I had previously read Herman Koch's ""The Dinner"" and loved it.  After reading the first few pages of this book in preview mode I noticed, again, how adept the author is at translating a character's innermost feelings, biases, perspectives, and observations into words.  One of my literature professors once told us that a very good writer can express something in words so well that it resonates in our mind as if we had thought of it ourselves.  We literally stand in the shoes of the author and view the world through his (or her) eyes, but it's so vivid it's as if we arrived at the same thought at the same point in time. Such an author is Herman Koch.  His stories (at least the two I've read so far) are not pleasant - the characters are flawed, unlikable, and exhibit the worst side of human nature.  But, we all know or have observed people like this - we recognize them instantly - in a sense becoming so immersed in the story that it's as if we are there, in those scenes, as an invisible observer.  I can understand those reviewers who didn't enjoy the book - it is not a tidy book, with likeable characters, a well-framed plot, and a ""tie up all the loose ends"" ending.  It is a character study of the darker side of human nature, taking us to where most of us have never gone before, but, given the right circumstances, one never knows what each of us is capable of doing. I found it delicious reading, enjoying the mastery of a not only a brilliant author, but a brilliant observer and interpreter of human nature, albeit the darker side of same.  While I don't envision a steady diet of delving into the dysfunctional side of human behavior - the occasional read, done with the excellence of the author, is a fascinating journey.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24E1TUQL4I24H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6JHM18#wasThisHelpful","R24E1TUQL4I24H","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Liane Moriarty's books!!! This is my second of her books (the first was ""The Husband's Secret"") and her ability to tell a 'can't put it down story' is first rate.  The two books I've read (and from what I read about her, this may be a central theme), are oriented towards female leads, set in Australia. One could almost characterize them as ""chick lit,"" but that would be grossly incorrect.  Both books had multiple characters (it takes about 30 pages to get the characters sorted out in your mind, but trust me, you will), and the way she interweaves their story lines is seamless.  There is drama, humor, mystery, and (in the two books I've read) murder/death. There are nasty characters and good characters, but they are not caricatures - they come to life on the page.  Her ability to write dialogue is unparalleled.  Two of the most enjoyable reads I've had this year.  I strongly recommend you give Liane a try - you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VY1IK9ABKKDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDMMISA#wasThisHelpful","R3VY1IK9ABKKDE","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I make by book choices by reading the reviews and reading the opening section of the book - these are both amazing features Amazon has provided and one of the primary reasons I am an avid Amazon books fan and buyer.  But this book proves the occasional exception - you can't always depend on reviews.  Now that I've read the book, and wasn't terribly impressed, I went back and reread many of the reviews and noticed a consistent theme - almost all were long-time ""fans"" of both the authors and more specifically, the character Aloysious Pendergast.  As I read the opening section, it appeared that (as others have stated) this series is somewhat of a ""tongue in cheek"" approach - to be taken lightly.  The initial introduction to agent Pendergast made me think ""OK, this is going to be sort of a Sherlock Holmes character - brilliant, big ego, independent, doesn't suffer fools, etc.""  I can handle that angle - I love Sherlock Holmes.  As I read further, I find that agent Pendergast does not even come close to living up to those expectations. He is far from brilliant (thoughtless blunders throughout the book), pompous, and downright rude - not a likable character.  And, he is not even the central character in the story.  Other NYPD detectives drive most of the plot, which is all over the map, and as the book nears closure the two female characters take over the story and, as another reviewer noted, we witness a fantastically unbelievable sequence of out of character events and actions by these two ladies that suspend belief - all to save the life of Aloysious who, frankly, given his negative qualities, may not be worth saving.  I was also put off by the authors use of 4-bit words when 2-bit words would more than suffice. I imagine they were showing their extensive vocabulary, but really, why not just say a person died of alcoholism rather than some esoteric word I need to look up in the Kindle at-hand dictionary?  So, to sum it up:Cons- Aloysious Pendergast is neither likable or brilliant- The story has so many holes in the plot and unbelievable moments it all seems contrived- The characters come and go - very little continuity, with the exception of Lieutenant D'Agosta - the only character I actually liked- It is ""Romance Novel"" quality writing adapted to a mystery genrePros- It wasn't so bad that I quit reading - I did finish it.I don't plan on reading any more books by these authors","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FQN89X8UUSWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRISI74#wasThisHelpful","R2FQN89X8UUSWE","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are very mixed reviews for this book, and I can understand it.  It is more of a deep psychological character study than a novel.  There isn't a lot of plot, per se, but the interplay, both in dialogue and background writing, among the characters is spot on. This is a dysfunctional group, who on the surface are not only upstanding, but highly regarded and well known citizens. The book delves into, and does an excellent job of giving significant insight, into their flaws, prejudices, jealousies, and lies in the course of an evening dinner.  I found it fascinating and thoroughly enjoyed it - and clearly see why it is/was a prize winner. If you're looking for a traditional novel/story with a beginning, plot setup, plot development, and tidy ending don't look here.

"Excellent writer, elements of an epic saga, but a little too much self-importance in the characters.  By self-important I mean drawn as caricatures - the Southern oil man, his ruthless father, his psychotic wife, and his philandering. The main character's over-confidence and irresolute values that belie an innate opposite result - poor judgment, braggadacio, and outright stupid statements and actions that lead to terrible consequences for himself, his wife, and his partner.  More like a soap opera than a saga - at least for me.

The Gathering is similar, but different. Still soothing, with a little less of the didgeridoo foundation but retaining that excellent mix of sound that, in total, put the listener in a different, much calmer state of mind.

"Admittedly, I was attracted to try this book as much by the low price ($1.99, Kindle) as I was by the erudite and positive reviews. It is a collection of four novellas, written primarily in first person form. The most famous is ""Letter from an Unknown Woman"", which leads off the collection, but I truthfully enjoyed all of them.  Written and set in the early years of the 20th century, the dialogue and settings are consistent with that milieu, but nevertheless timeless in their story lines.  Each of them portrays, in different ways, a compelling event, character, or life lesson, with elements of tragedy, but not overdone in that regard.  They cover plots ranging from the (literally) lifelong obsession of a young teenage girl through adulthood who is obsessed with an older man who happens to take an apartment in the same building as her family.  Even though her family moves away, her obsession never wavers and her whole life, focus, and thoughts center around this 'man of her dreams,' who has no knowledge of any of this. It goes beyond the simple story mechanics and edges into observations of the human psyche, in a very enlightening, somewhat macabre, but also very readable approach.  The other stories, in their own way, portray ""life lessons' - not in a preachy way, but through simple dialogue, leaving the impression to the reader.  I can't think of a better way to introduce a change of pace and reading style into your book list which provides so much in so little reading time - around 2-3 hours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TM98UV60NPR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGUEXFG#wasThisHelpful","R3TM98UV60NPR0","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I said in my review for the 10 foot long version of this charging cord, I've learned my lesson about buying inexpensive lightning cords that are not apple certified.  They either don't work or they stop working after a month or two.  Lesson learned. This cord is great - very sturdy with a thicker cord and thicker plastic piece holding the lightning pin connector.

"I've gone the route of buying inexpensive charging cords for my iPads and iPhones, and finally learned my lesson - you get what you pay for.  Most of them didn't work, and those that did stopped working after a month or two. You need to buy either Apple, or Apple certified charging cords.  Yes, you'll pay more, but how much did you lose buying those less expensive inferior cords?  This monster is heavy duty. The cord is much thicker than the Apple cords, and even the end piece with the lightning 8-pin connector is thicker and more sturdy.  The ONLY downside to this cord is the size of the lightning connector piece.  It may not fit through your iPhone case charging slot.  I have both an iPhone 5c and 5s, and both have Speck cases. The charge cord opening on the 5c case is too small to accommodate this cord, but the case on the 5s accommodates it fine.  Since the 5s is my traveling phone I'm happy - which is why I bought the 10 foot cord.  Hotel rooms are not always well-designed in terms of where they put their power outlets, so no I have no problems having the phone close by (e.g. night clock, etc.) with the longer cord.

"This is a fantastic read.  I finished it in two days - couldn't put it down. It is really three linked stories. The first is the abduction/kidnapping of ""Alex,"" a 30 year old woman, for essentially (at that point in the book) reasons unknown - presumably random cruelty. She is subjected to a horrifying experience, so those of you with tender stomachs beware, there are very graphic descriptions of torture and suffering.  Miraculously, through a believable chain of events and realization she is a determined, smart woman, she escapes.  The French Police are involved, and we are introduced to (in more detail) to the lead inspector ""Camille"", who reminds me (in a very positive way) of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot.  Very small in stature but with millions of ""little gray cells"", he leads us on a combined action and mental deductive path as he works the case. The second ""story"" is that of Alex escaped and in the world.  As it turns out, she is not what we thought she was - an innocent victim, and without spoiling the story, murders occur, and she is the likely suspect - but no one can find her.  The third story begins when Inspector Camille begins to unravel her life, relentlessly tracking down her past through friends, co-workers, neighbors, and finally her mother and brother.  The final denouement is the detainment and questioning of her brother, and this is where Camille's supreme detective and intuitive powers come into play.  He is masterful - every bit Poirot's equal, both in the mental and verbal sparring with Alex's brother as he slowing reveals the facts at exactly the right moment, drawing the case closer and closer to a most satisfactory, but somewhat surprising (you won't realize it until the final paragraphs) ending.  A masterful work, and one of the best books I've read this year. Inspector Camille is the star, but the author paints all of the supporting characters extremely well.  If you like detective stories, police procedurals, and  just plain can't put it down reading, this book is for you.  Highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B408KN2CL29E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSX5J4K#wasThisHelpful","R1B408KN2CL29E","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this book immensely.  Like many, I enjoy mystery/detective novels, and this is among the best.  It is more along the lines of a police procedural, and stays true to that format throughout - which is a good thing.  Yes, it does provide good character descriptions so that we feel we know not only Wallender but his colleagues, but most of what we find out is clearly in the context of police work - no wandering off into other character information that drags us off the storyline.  And the storyline is intense.  Wallender is pursuing the most difficult prey - a serial killer who seemingly offers no motive or pattern upon which to base a methodical investigation.  It is Wallender's determination and dogged, self-exhausting approach to finding the killer that makes it riveting.  He foregoes sleep and his own health issues to stay on top of the case and his police team.  Once that process starts in earnest, this is a page turner - you might be ready to go to sleep but you just have to see what's on the next page.  The plot evolves masterfully. There are subtle clues, chance comments, and Wallender's logic that slowly tighten the circle on identifying and finding the killer.  Wallender is relentless, and despite setbacks and missed opportunities, he does succeed.  My only minor note is that I suspect some of the dialogue was affected by translation from Swedish, but very minor and not at all detracting from the enjoyable read.  This was my first Wallender book and I look forward to reading other books in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XTRIJ9HLN1Z5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GX1OZ6#wasThisHelpful","R2XTRIJ9HLN1Z5","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think I may have finally exhausted all of the Bertie and Jeeves books/stories by Wodehouse, so in a sense this is a sad day for me.  I suppose over time I'll have enough mental distance to read some of them again, but I feel as if I've lost a treasured group of close friends.  The unique, and very different, characters of Bertie (the loutish but well-intentioned moneyed upper-class wastrel) and Jeeves (the classic ""gentleman's gentleman"" who anticipates every need, magically appears when needed, and applies his ""huge brain"" (""eats lots of fish"", per Bertie)) to consistently delivers Bertie (and others) from precarious predicaments.  There are no plots, per se, to these books; just the wonderful repartee, musings, and misadventures of Bertie countered by Jeeves unflappable demeanor and ability to ""save the day"" at the denouement moment.  I won't describe the details of the story because they are ultimately irrelevant - it's the dialogue and situations that carry the day.  IMHO there has never been a humorist as brilliant as Wodehouse.  I love his other 'series' (Blanding's Castle, Uncle Fred, etc.) but Bertie and Jeeves top the list.  My life has truly been better having discovered this exquisitely entertaining world old P.G. created.

"I liked this book, but found it dragged a little, and frankly had a hard time keeping all of the characters straight.  Probably the best part about it is the author's writing style.  Very straightforward and direct - uses words economically.  The milieu is interesting - the backwoods area and people of upper Northeast Pennsylvania.  Survivalists, hunters, meth labs, subsistence living - sort of a ""Deliverance"" cast in the Northeast part of the country. The central character is of that culture, but also a lawman.  He works doggedly to solve two murders, one of a ""person unknown"" and the other of his deputy.  He does a great job of describing the physical environment and the characters in the area.  But again, I wasn't really ""grabbed"" by the plot, found it somewhat difficult  to follow the characters and the evolving plot line - it shouldn't take that much work.  I did enjoy his writing style and the book came to a satisfying closure in pulling all of the various characters and plot line together (unlike some other books I've read recently.

"I've gone through numerous iPad cases/covers since I bought my iPad 4 a couple of years ago.  Everything from the ""rugged"" covers (didn't like) to slide-in cases to - you name it.  I finally tried one of the Smart Cover versions and really liked it, primarily due to it being light, not adding much thickness or weight to my iPad, and pretty much suiting my needs.  Unfortunately the one I purchased was made out of pretty cheap vinyl and within a month the corners were separating, etc. - so back to searching on Amazon. I found this ""leather"" Smart cover and I've had it about a month now and really like it.PROs- I don't know if it's real leather, but the cover looks very nice and is very well made.  Much more durable than my previous cheap vinyl cover.  it looks like it will stand up to handling for a long time- There is a unique magnetized portion of the cover (hard to explain - I think the listing shows how it works), but in folding up the cover into a triangle shape to use it as a stand you fold it so that the leather side is facing out, and the outer edge of the leather cover magnetically connects forming the triangle base.  Pretty cool - and it holds its shape and position very well- well made and durableCONs- the only con, and it's a minor one, is that I think the magnetized cover, when folded over to use the iPad in landscape or portrait mode, can accidentally put the iPad to sleep.  What I have done is to always fold under the outermost section of the cover so that it doesn't extend all the way to the back edge of the iPad - a minor issue. That solved the problem.Over all, very satisfied, and the price is unbelievable. It looks beautiful, and for me the thin cover allows me to use my Anker stand with the iPad fitting in the bottom slot, whereas thicker covers do not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CO8JHOATYK2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBDBSF8#wasThisHelpful","R1CO8JHOATYK2M","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book has no weaknesses.  It grabs your interest from the very first page and holds it right through to the end.  Its probably my shortest duration read of the year (not shortest book  I just couldnt put it down).  First, it is eminently readable; the author has a way with words and storytelling that show real talent.  The setting is Western Australia, and while the focus is more on character than environment, she manages to mix excellent dialogue, descriptions of the country, people, setting of time and place, and cultural milieu perfectly.The storyline focuses on a couple, Tom and Isabel Sherbourne, newly married  after World War 1, living on a remote lighthouse post one hundred miles off the shore of southwestern Australia.  The insights into their characters, primarily Tom, is telling, as he deals with the terrible memories of his time in the trenches during the war, the friends he lost, and the Germans he killed.  He is eminently likable in terms of his values and character.  He meets Isabel (or I should say she meets him  and sets her sights on him) not long after his return from the War and his obtaining a post as a remote Lighthouse keeper  a job well-suited to his desire to get away for a while to deal with his emotional war memories.  They fall in love, get married, move to the remote Lighthouse island and set up as typical newlyweds.  Isabel desperately wants children, but after multiple miscarriages becomes resolved to the fact that their marriage will be childless.  No plot giveaway here, because it briefly opens the book, but one day a boat washes up on shore with a dead man and a young, but very alive, baby girl.From this point forward the book moves away from its day-to-day life of a family focus (which is still interesting), to a character study of the decisions they make, and eventually the consequences of those decisions.  It covers many perspectives  love, innate desires, rationalization of decisions, internal turmoil resulting from those decisions, doing whats right in a broader moral sense vs. doing whats right on a personal level, all carried off in a very deft manner by the author.  I had a sense of what the ending would be, but frankly was never certain.  Not until the last few pages does the reader find out the denouement.  In the end I would say it probes deeply into several life realities; how seemingly logical in the moment decisions can have long term consequences, how life is filled with both good events and bad events and their outcome (and our sanity) depends more on how we deal with them than the events themselves, and that life is never perfect and we must learn to make the most of what is given us, and cope with what is taken away from us.In summary, I found this book enjoyable, with likable but deep and interesting characters, and perhaps most importantly made me think (and will continue to make me think), about how our decisions, our character, and our attitude toward lifes ups and downs determines our ultimate satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our lives and ourselves.  Strongly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JC51Z5DU11E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064CL1T2#wasThisHelpful","R2JC51Z5DU11E1","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's really mystifying to see all the glowing reviews for this book. I was very disappointed, for many reasons. First the entire first half of the book is tedious. I guess it's supposed to set up the second half of the book, but if so it could have done so in fewer pages. I was ready to give up on the book at the 50% point.  The two main characters are not likable, occasionally to the point of disgust.  I understand that characters don't need to be necessarily likable (e.g. Anna Karenina) but c'mon, this is a summer read, not classic literature. I'll admit at the 50% point it did grab me, and I'm thinking ""ok, here' s the payoff for the miserable first half.""  I won't write a spoiler review, so I'll just say that the second half sets the reader up for what could have been a sublime ending and frankly, even with having to wade though the first half, I would have written a positive review.  But sadly the ending is...extremely disappointing, unbelievable, and unsatisfying.  Have I made my point?  I literally felt cheated - a waste of my time is the best way to describe my feeling. Again, I wonder what book the praising reviewers were reading. It wasn't this one.

"I wanted a bluetooth transmitter for my iPod Classic.  I bought this before seeing that there were models that attach via the iPod 30 Pin connector port.  This one attaches via a 3.5mm to 3.5mm double male connector (included with purchase, as well as a charging cord).  I think in retrospect I would prefer the 30 pin connector version since it sort of makes the iPod/Bluetooth device one compact unit.  Anyway, I can tell you that it does work, but not at a great distance from your speaker.  Max range line of sight is about 10 feet, and if any walls or doors are you are in the way it will not give a clear connection. When the connection is clear you will get good music play on your bluetooth speaker. The sound quality is more dependent on your speaker than on this device.  I am buying an inexpensive compact (no wire, one piece, metal) 3.5mm to 3.5mm plug that will come close to making this a ""one piece device"" with my iPod Classic.  Pairing is relatively easy, but be patient.  Put it in pairing mode close to your Bluetooth speaker and be prepared to wait about 10 seconds before pairing completes.  From that point on it should pair easily with the same speaker.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EWZDE4HO8WPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQUNODQ#wasThisHelpful","R3EWZDE4HO8WPN","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did an unbelievable amount of research before buying this portable bluetooth speaker/speakerphone.  I watched dozens of YouTube videos, tried out as many models as I could at airport kiosks (I do a lot of traveling - hence the need for something portable).  My firm criteria was a) good sound quality - not ultra priced headphone or speaker quality, but not ""tinny"" or cheap sounding, b) ability to use (easily) as a speakerphone with my iPhone with good sound quality both talking and listening, and c) handy travel size and construction (i.e. can take some rough handling).  This one meets my standards on all three criteria. The sound is great - amazing bass from something about 4.5"" in diameter. The Treble and Mids are great as well - you will enjoy your music, much better than your iPhone or iPad can produce.  Second, pairing is easy.  When you press the Power On button a pleasant female voice says ""Powering Up,""  When you turn on Bluetooth on your phone or tablet the device says ""Pairing,"" and when paired is successful says ""You are connected.""  I went with the black with red outer ring model because the controls are easier to see on the red ring, plus the black/red combo looks cool. It's built solid - no cheap plastic feel here.  And it comes with a carry bag,  a carabiner to hook to your bag, a 3.5mm to 3.5mm male connection cord, and USB to micro-USB charging cord.

It's infinitely adjustable for any angle (just push in the round ends of the swivel bar and move to the position you desire), and best of all it holds my iPad with the Smart Cover.  If you have a thicker cover you may have to remove the rubber inserts, or let your iPad st on top of the holding ledge vice inside it, but my Smart cover fits with no problem.

The author has an excellent command of language, but that was only enough to hold my interest about a quarter of the way through the book. I kept waiting for other characters to emerge, other dialogue, a plot, a story.  I think it might have worked well as a short story, but not a novel.

"My Fiat is, as you know, a tiny car - but with a huge windshield. After careful measurement I figured these would fit, so ordered them.  They are well made - not cheap, and fit my car perfectly.  I had always had the ""single"" large foldable shades before, but after getting these I find I prefeer the two separate pieces; they give you more options for coverage and are easier to use.

One hand on top in one corner, one hand on the bottom on the opposite corner, and just ""twist"" them closed into a small circle - which stays closed by the way.

"This magnifier is just OK.  The slide cover mechanism is a little cumbersome - it does work, but not as smooth as I had expected.  Overall not quite the quality I wanted.  My major issue is with the magnifier glass/plastic portion.  There is a lot of distortion around the edges.  The usable portion is a smaller circle in the center of the area. The item is not big to begin with, so you're not getting the full magnification across the entire lens area that you might want or need.

"Yes, there are some aspects of this very well written debut novel that strectch believability, but in real life we see these things happen, and in the end I found it to be an engrossing read.  Those of us that are growing older can certainly empathize with the aging Ruth and her evolving issues with both recognizing her onset of dementia and weakening ability to cope with it.  In this state she is the perfect victim - isolated, alone, and (as we learn from her recollections of younger days), burdened with a ""willing to go along"" personality.  Into her life comes the unexpected, ""too good to be true"" Frida, who's strong presence and assertive behavior Ruth willingly succombs to, blithely indifferent to Frida's increasingly invasive intrusion and control of her life.  What I found unbelievable (but again, this happens) was Ruth's son's reaction to this sudden change of condition; He readily accepts Frida's thin explanations of her presence - perhaps too quickly glad to distance himself from concern about his aging mother's welfare.  By the time he  realizes his mother's risk, it is too late.  In a sense, the ending was inevitable and no surprise, but in spite of that I found this to be a page turner.  I literally read it in two days.  Ms. McFarlane has talent; her dialogue is superb, catching the nuances of Ruth's confusion in the present and her vivid memories of the past.  Cast against the cunning, illogical but seemingly logical arguments of Frida, she is helpless, carried inevitably toward her fate unable to cope with the strength of her predator Frida, as sure of her prey as the allegorical Tiger in the night Ruth hears, but never sees, prowling through her house. Aside from the story and the enjoyment of reading it, this is a representation of the world as it can be, where the weak are spotted, tracked, and ultimately fall victim to the predators in our midst.  Sons and daughters, look after your parents.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30IRK4JU0SGCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C74VCQ8#wasThisHelpful","R30IRK4JU0SGCM","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've purchased numerous ""Apple or Apple compliant"" AC to USB charger units with hit or miss results.  When I saw this unit it prompted research on it and similar units, and I finally found out why some work and some don't.  They have different voltages!  I don't have an iPhone (yet), but I do have two iPads, and I'd get frustrated when I bought an ""Apple equivalent"" charger and it wouldn't work on my iPads.  The answer is that they were only generating less than the 2.1A needed for the iPad, and were likely generating only 1.0 or 1.5A, sufficient to charge an iPhone or Android phone.  So, after considering both the corded and uncorded (this model) I went with this one.  I have enough clutter, and didn't need or want a cord to exacerbate the problem.  Since receiving it I've been very satisfied. The outlets are clearly marked for the types of devices you can charge from each USB port.  As a result, my desk/work area top is much less cluttered, plus it's small and very handy for traveling.

"Other than being a little difficult in the beginning following the dual story lines from WW II to 1999-2000, the story begins to get a good rhythm and takes off from there.  Harry Hole is the prototypical beaten down but persistent but talented detective.  Smokes too much drinks too much, too often caustic, but ultimately knows himself and his business.  In other words, you may not like him in person, but you love reading about him.

"This is an amusing and pleasant read, for about 100 pages.  After that, it becomes interminably repetitive and self-absorbed.  The author writes in an engaging style about life in a small New England town and his adoption and growing interaction with his dog Atticus and their mutual evolution into a renowned local twosome in accomplishing the physical and mental challenges of climbing all of the 4000 foot mountains in the state not once, but twice in a single winter. He presents himself as an iconoclast, writing and editing a local paper, touting himself as the lone voice against local political shenanigans, and tries valiantly to describe how his ability to overcome physical (he reveals his weight at over 300 pounds early on) challenges is eminently worthy. But put simply he tries too hard, and succeeds, at putting himself and, by association, Atticus, in the center of their own little universe, touting their accomplishments and ability to see the true beauty of nature while too often pointing out the inability of others to do the same.  Ultimately, this persistent theme of self-importance and blatant lack of any evolution of the story beyond simple numerical progress (""we made four peaks today"") caused me to put it down - I could take no more.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZK26MVEZJP3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XVN82Y#wasThisHelpful","R2ZK26MVEZJP3O","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have lived long enough to have read articles, books, textbook sections, and seen movies about the institution of slavery.  I have also read books about the horrors of Nazi Germany's death camps and the plight of Jews throughout WW II Europe (e.g. Jodi Piccoult's ""The Storyteller"", Elie Weisel's ""Night"", among others).  The Holocaust, more recent and therefore more easily recalled, described, and verified, displays man's inhumanity to man and, perhaps more telling, the social acceptance, handed down from parents to children and reinforced by political and social leadership, of the inferiority of another race as justification for treating them no better, and often worse, than animals. Reading first person accounts of life in the Nazi death camps gave me some sense of how the day-by-day, no end in sight inhumane treatment including verbal and physical abuse, near starvation, lack of any medical care, and lack of sleep can lead one to concluding that anything, including death, is preferable to living in such conditions.  I guess I never really put slavery in that category of suffering - until reading this book.I always knew that slavery was terrible - my own sense of human equality and common sense told me so.  But unlike the Holocaust, slavery had its rose-colored glasses perspectives as well - witness ""Gone With the Wind,"" et al.  But Solomon Northrup's story, especially the ten years spent in the Louisiana bayou on Epp's farm, portrays it in stark, brutal terms.  What must it be like to spend every waking hour in fear? From the lash and interminable back-breaking labor to the reality that you have no worth beyond serving the needs, financial, physical, and psychological of not only your owner but every other non-slave person in your world?  And no matter how terrible and physically punishing this day was that the next day held the same, or worse, outcome?  It was into this hell that Solomon Northrup was consigned for 12 years, and the sheer luck through which benign help and pure coincidence restored him to his freedom somewhat restores faith in human care and courage in helping his fellow man.The story is compelling - a page turner - and Solomon's account is articulate and objective.  Yes, it is not pleasant reading of such horrors, but it is written more as a documentary than a novel - a diary, as it were. Yes, it was slavery at its worst, and yes, even Solomon talks of owners who were more humane towards their slaves, but even those few, in perspective, separated mothers from children, husbands from wives, and had no qualms about selling their ""property"" into far worse situations. It was ""the way life was"" in those times.  Everyone, young and old, needs to read this book.  Not to wallow in self-guilt of the sins of more than a hundred years ago, just as none of us bear guilt for the Holocaust. But to better understand not only the glory, but the depths, of our country's history.  And while human cruelty and disregard for the value of life will be with us always, perhaps better insight and knowledge about its suffering and consequences can in some small way prevent it, in any form, from happening again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MPIGBTJA3VN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GA3JEXK#wasThisHelpful","R11MPIGBTJA3VN","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've accumulated about 5 or 6 iPad covers, ranging from the bare bones thin rubber slip-on to the ""leather-like"" book style where your iPad slips sideways into the inner pocket area to the rather nice Devicewear book style model with the little ""clip"" that ensures the iPad won't slip out of the several grooves available for upright landscap horizontal stance use, etc.  Of those mentioned, the Devicewear is, by quality, the best.  It has a very well-fitted hard plastic case that your iPad literally shoe horns into (not easy to get in, but never worry about it falling out), and I liked the ""tab and groove-channel"" feature to prevent slipping. But I also found that those cases are really great for landscape use (watching movies), but not so great for portrait applications or taking photos. I even bought a bluetooth keyboard that snaps on top of the iPad, made of aluminum, with the result that it looks like a small laptop, and if you do a lot of typing it's great.  But when I really analyzed how I used my iPad - basically just grabbing it and holding on my lap (at home) or on the fold-down table (plane flights) I could do without the front cover, wanted something a little rugged that would protect it well and also protect the screen (even if there is no screen cover) with a raised area to prevent the screen from contacting the floor first if dropped, so decided to give this one a try.  It comes in three pieces and zero instructions.  It's already assembled, so you have to take it apart first.  When I figured out you need to remove the outer silicone cover first (not intuitive), it was reasonable easy (a few tries) to separate the two plastic pieces inside. The iPad fits well into the bottom piece, then you simply work your way around the edge snapping the top and bottom pieces together (be sure you've got it turned so it aligns with the right buttons, switches, and camera).  It's a pretty snug fit once done. Then put the silicone cover back on (it fits snugly, so you'll have to do some stretching at the corners to pop it on).  Once on, it fits well, and the appearance is fine.  It does make the already heavy iPad even heavier, but I don't consider it a problem. It does protect the iPad very well, in my opinion.  Most of the iPad controls (charging plug, microphone, speaker, etc.) have notches cut out for them - no cover flaps (the speaker has holes, vice a cutout).  The exceptions are the side volume controls and the home button, but I find it easy to control them/press them through the silicone cover easily marked and tactile raised areas designed for that purpose. Finally it has a fold out stand on the back.  I had read many reviews about these fold out stands being ""cheap"" and breaking quickly.  I find this one one well made and unless you're crazy and pull it out very hard it's not going to break.  So you have a great stand for landscape use (watching movies, videos) and yes it works for portrait mode as well.  But frankly I usually hold my iPad on my lap or lay on a table when using portrait mode.  I think the Pros of this cover are that it is well made, protects your iPad, has a good stand, good fit, and easy access to all ports/controls/buttons.  The Cons are it makes your heavy iPad even heavier (not much of a bother to me - I like the solid feel), and it's not going to win any beauty contests - just your basic black.  Time will tell if this is the ""keeper"" iPad case/cover for me, but so far I like it - and the price is very reasonable. Oh, and it comes from China so you'll have to wait about 2-3 weeks to get it.  But it did arrive as promised.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R387ORMECUCI9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GN17NNM#wasThisHelpful","R387ORMECUCI9D","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't really looking for an external speaker for my iPad, but in browsing around on Amazon I saw several relatively inexpensive speakers with good to very good reviews.  Given the average built-in iPad speaker, at the prices I was seeing, I started doing some research across the various products, and settled on this one.  The factors that 'sold' me were the compact size, the ability to use it standing alone or attached to the iPad, the rechargeable battery, and most of all the very good reviews on the sound volume, clarity, and quality.  At this price I could't resist.  After receiving it, I found it well packaged and attractive, in a 'techie' sense.  I charged it for 3 hours as instructed, then tried it out on my iPad and the sound was very good.  Certainly not audiophile quality or anythng close, but a marked improvement from the iPad internal speaker. The size makes it easy to pack and use.  It comes with a charging cord (USB, but you can plug that into an AC adaptor) and a dual end audio connector (3.5mm? - the standard plug-in jack).  As an added note and recommendation, I purchased the ""Bongiovi DPS Pro"" app, which is a music player app.  I tried several (Accudio, Stella, Equalizer), but Bongiovi beat them all hands down.  It has a 'DPS' sound processor that really, and i do mean really, works.  It enhances the sound of music on your iPad (they also have a Mac version, which I also purchased). The difference with the DPS turned on and off is night and day.  The music quality, clarity, and refinement will blow you away.  I think the iPad app is $3, and the Mac app is $20.  And you can customize it to your earphones, headphones, or external speaker models.  But back to this product - with or without the DPS enhancement it's a must have.  Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JMOANIAP889H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZEZGE2#wasThisHelpful","R2JMOANIAP889H","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a ""readable"" novel - I finished it. I don't finish books that don't hold my interest in (pick one): compelling writing, compelling plot, outstanding use of language, or interesting characters.  This one meets the mark in interesting characters and a sense of learning more about what slavery, and day-to-day relations between race were like pre-civil war, but that's about it.  There are a range of characters from the young black woman who had supposed magic powers, a plethora of ""bad people"" led by a ruthless slave trader woman, an honest and courageous widowed farmer who treats her slaves with honor and integrity, and a lesser group of low-character types on the trail of any negro target they could catch, abduct, or otherwise capture and turn for profit.  This leads to a range of concurrent storylines which detract from the plot - not add to it.There are a few likable characters - the widow farmer, her male slave, the ""Woolman"" (a black man who has left society to live mysteriously in the swamplands of Maryland's eastern shore), but the remainder are in a contest over who can be more vile, greedy, or contemptuous.  Read it if you are hostorically minded and interested in learning about slavery with some elements (few) of the underground railroad, but if you're looking for a good story and a good page-turner read, pass it by.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OIBGSP0E4PF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012RMVJ8#wasThisHelpful","R2OIBGSP0E4PF1","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What caused me to choose this one was that it was all-metal; the others at this price point are a combination of metal and plastic, or all plastic.  And if I have to change a battery with a little tool, I definitely want metal, not plastic. Second, although I couldn't really confirm it until I got it, is that it is well made in terms of opening and closing easily, yet it stays closed when closed.  The loupe portion is large enough to easy look through while holding up close to your eye (and holding the object of interest about an inch away from the other end, and it works whether you wear glasses or not - just a slight adjustment in how far you hold the object of interest from the loupe is the only adjustment needed.

We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.

"I'm a HUGE fan of P.G. Wodehouse, one of the most brilliiant humorists of the last century - probably longer.  His Jeeves and Bertie books stand head and shoulders at the top of British humor fiction.  And he achieves all of this without a plot - just a series of misadventures.  Bertie and Jeeves never really change - but their dialogue and predicaments and odd quirks and...the list goes on, are knee-slapping funny.  Still great, but lesser so, are the Blandings books, Psmith, and a few others.  But many of his earlier books, and those that stray from the tried and true characters and settings, leave us faithful waiting breathlessly for the crackling humor and craziness of his core novels, and as good as they are, they don't quite meet the standard.  At worst they ""drag"" a little - you keep waiting for the crisp, laugh on every page writing that one has become accustomed to.  Cocktail time is not unfunny nor unreadable, but just don't expect ""classic"" Wodehouse.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q8PD83UR5RQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AN86KB2#wasThisHelpful","R1Q8PD83UR5RQH","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is either a long short story or a novella, easily read in one or two sittings.  While the plot is a litle contrived, it is eminently readable. The author knows how to turn a phrase, set up and describe a scene, and transition along at a good pace without bogging down.  It comes close (but no cigar) to being a ""page turner,"" which is not bad for this price point.  It held my interest and, despite what other reviewers have written, I had no problems with the ending (i.e. ""saw it coming"", ""unsatisfactory"", etc.).  In a story this short you can't really delve into every character's psyche or motivation (in this case the ""bad person""), so, again, it didn't bother me.  Probably perfect for a 2-3 hour airplane trip, or an afternoon read at the beach or cabin.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S861FCVPT9I4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008R08YUI#wasThisHelpful","R3S861FCVPT9I4","A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJNRYYZ2OJ5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a little bit of an ""over the top"" person on flashlights - I have them stashed all over the house and garage, and I love the new LED models - they are infinitely brighter than the older models, and much smaller in size.  I was going to get an extendable inspection mirror with a led lights when I saw this LED flashlight, extendible with a flexible end section (about the last 3-4 inches can be curved as needed) AND it also has an attachable inspection mirror - two tools in one!  After receiving it, I can tell you the quality is excellent. The mirror attaches very securely and easily to the flashlight tip and stays there.  There are magnets at both ends of the flashlight - the back (so you could attach it to something without having to hold it while you're doing work) as well as on the lighted end (i.e. to both see and pick up metal items in tight spaces).

"I feel like we have been tolerating the same water pitcher for far too long.  Plenty of competition, but other that an LED light, which is not really that new, it's still an annoying water pitcher with a reservoir that is too small, and clumsy to use.  However, still a quality filter which does filter water well.  So it's basically down to selecting which water filter suits your needs and fitting into a pitcher that stores well in your fridge.  You replace the filter every couple months no matter what.  And I usually just toss the entire thing away once a year, hoping for improvements.  They are cheap enough, but still looking for something less bulky and easier to handle.  We have no found that yet.

"After a few days of use, I am quite happy with this lotion.  I will follow up in about 30 days for results.I have been using this lotion right before I leave the house for a long morning walk.  It offers great SPF and firms well in the open air.  It has a bit of a scent, and I am very anti-scent, but this is tolerable, light and natural.  It applies easily and absorbs quickly. I almost want to apply another lotion on top, but after physical activity in the morning, I find that even with sweat, the lotion stays on well.  Apply on a clean face, and I merely rinse when I return.  I have been using it a couple times a day.  I would say it is fine for sensitive skin, as I typically need to choose that option.  No issues at all.The firming aspect is yet to be seen, that is why I will follow up. But I do feel is invigerates the skin slightly, and the quick drying nature makes sense. Does not dry the skin, just absorbs quickly.  So I put about 5 dots on my face and work in to get best coverage.

"Even at the list price, it's a pretty decent deal.  But currently on the date of this review, it's almost half off.  I have many air purifiers all over the house due to allergies. I have reviewed many due to my constant use.  So my 5 star rating is not based on the precise quality of cleaning, but the value for your money.The HEPA filtration is impressive. And the Ionizer option is great.  I remember wasting money on the Sharper Image Ionizer towers that did nothing.  Without airflow, it does not work.  This has both.  With three speeds, I find medium works perfectly in my office and any sound is hardly noticeable. I also like the compact nature of it as is fits well on top of my bookshelf without taking much room.Typically when a purifier is in this price range, they lure you in to be stuck paying high prices for filters that don't last long.  Though I have only had it a month, Holmes suggest changing the filter every 12-18 months.  That is amazing.  But the filters are very inexpensive.  So even if you had a heavy pollen or dust situation, you are not breaking the bank feeding this thing filters.  This takes an ""A filter"", but on this page it suggests or shows ""Frequently Bought Together""... and that filter is fine, but there is a better updated one, and it's cheaper.  Ber sure to get the ""HAPF30AT4-U4R"".  The single pack is the one to buy, also, if you use Amazon's ""Subscribe and Save"", you could set it to send every six months, and save 15%.

"So far so good. It's a heavier cream with glycerin and oils that remain while key ingredients are absorbed.  I have used it during the day when I know I will not be seeing anyone.  Just because it does shine a bit.  I do like the natural extracts and attention to less chemical ingredients put into the jar, as there are so many.I do have sensitivity to scents and perfumes, and this does have a flowery overtone, but not too bad.  At first I was afraid to put it on but stuck with it and ultimately wish it was not added.  There is no definition as to what the ""parfum"" is except that it is natural.  So maybe that's why it's not annoying me that much.I like to put it on at night, but not at bed time.  It will get on your pillow, so I want some time for it to absorb.  So a couple hours before bed I will apply.  It has a light invigoration to it, not unpleasant.  I exfoliate and cleanse before applying, so that would add to the sensation.

"Yes the price points of these products are a bit obnoxious, however, once you start receiving compliments, you may rethink the value.The first time I tried this exfoliate, I wasn't very impressed.  I lightly washed my face prior to use.  Applied a generous amount to my face, scrubbed in circular motions, and left on for about ten minutes.  Rinsed off and applied my normal moisturizer.  I didn't feel or see anything different.  However, a few days later, I repeated the process, but got a phone call.  It was left on for at least twenty minutes, and I could start feeling the soft and natural oil result.  Before it just felt like a typical apricot scrub.  But with more time to sit, it really felt great.  It was also easier to rinse the second time.  Applying moisturizer felt like it was merely blending with my skin and not just layering on top.My skin appeared to me a bit more even toned and refreshed.  Obviously the scrub aspect bring out your color, but there was a definite change in softness and radiance.  But the true result were friends going out of their way to tell me how good my skin looks and asking me what I did etc.  That's pretty huge since I could care less and never asked them.  I did nothing different except use this exfoliate along with my normal lotion.I am highly sensitive to scents, perfumes and fragrance in general and the product did not bother me at all.  I am assuming the organic and natural ingredients were the reason I had no issue.  So for the price, it is most certainly a splurge or luxury product, but even if used prior to special events or occasionally, it would be worth giving a try and having on hand.  If they cut the list price in half, I would use it regularly and explore their other products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2166ZF13ZHRSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB85WKW#wasThisHelpful","R2166ZF13ZHRSF","A1WXG10FJ353K0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WXG10FJ353K0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This took some time getting up and running because I didn't want to risk doing it myself.  I relied on a neighbor and his friend to help me out.  So I was lucky to get away with the cost of a case of beer, and a game or two in the future.  This is an invasive permanent installation, so you really have to commit to where this is going.  However, once you find the right spot, you are able to adjust viewing angles in all directions with ease.I have a 60"" screen and never really trusted the thought of it being mountable in a movable form due to size.  But after seeing what when into the instal, I trust it is safe.  They obviously needed to mount to a stud, but he also reenforced with a an interior cross beam, basically connecting the parallel studs together.  All beyond me, but after a slight mess and worry, the mount was securely inserted and functional.The result is more like an unexpected feature since it appears flush like a wall hanging, but you can view from any direction without much effort with a very smooth glide in the direction you wish.  I can now watch from the kitchen from a distance if I wanted to.  The ergonomic design is well thought out and built to last.  I will be adding a frame around the opening and the wiring will be hidden inside the wall.  So that will require an electrician just for aesthetics for when it is pulled away from the wall.

In other words, I don't see it to be a problem.It's a minimum of a two person job to get this anywhere.

"Right off the bat I have to say this stuff does not stink. It is such a huge thing with me as typically such bronzers or self-tanners etc. have a smell that I cannot tolerate.

"I am actually a long-time TheraBreath product user.  I have used their rinse, toothpaste and even their mints and gum.  However, just the normal original strength versions.  I don't use them every day.  Just on days where I want to be sure and confident that the breath is important.  This is about eliminating the causes of bad breath, not covering it up temporarily with a minty fresh flavor or alcohol based wash.This toothpaste is not normal in a sense of what you are used to.  You don't use water.  You brush as you would typical paste, however, you are not going to get the rabid foam dripping down your hand.  You are merely treating your breath with your brush.  Brush as you normally would, but don't expect invigoration.  Expect your mouth to feel naturally clean.The ""PLUS"" series is new to me, and I already love it.  The normal series is still great for regular but periodic use.  But I will be using the Plus version for events, parties, meetings and dates from now on.  It definitely has an extra boost of clean as a result, and lasts a bit longer to me.Yes, it is expensive, but used at periodic times, it will last quite a bit.  You don't need much product when using them.  A little goes a long way.  It will take some getting used to. But do a before and after with your mate to test the result.  You may just get a little more action than usual.A tip for you.  For $1 and free shipping, if you go to their web site and enter Coupon Code: BTVK100 (current on May 2015) you will get the travel kit which contains a sample of everything.  Mouthwash, toothpaste, mints, gum and even a tongue scraper.  They also include coupons.  I'm sorry if the code does not work when you read this.  If it does not, just google ""therabreath $1"", just pay attention to the search result to make sure it is their web site.  It's a good way to try everything since it would be costly to buy all the normal sizes at once.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33GQ9HU6B260W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GLCES8#wasThisHelpful","R33GQ9HU6B260W","A1WXG10FJ353K0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WXG10FJ353K0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not a curling iron.  It's a straightening device that happens to also curl.I've been a licensed cosmetologist since the 80's. My most popular in demand service was hair straightening.  And I never used chemicals.  I was all about blow out.  I could straighten any type of hair with a blow dryer and roller brush.  However, you pay for it, because I do it right and it can take over an hour depending on your hair.I'm not big on novelty devices or tools that eliminate your creative methods.  But I will try anything once.  This is well made, but for the home, a single person use iron.  The appeal with this device is that it does is correctly, and well, if you do it correctly and well.  People that brush there hair and just iron it is damaging the hair and it never looks straight.  If it is not straight, flowing and shiny, then the person that did it, if not yourself, did it wrong.  There is no reason why your hair cannot be straight without chemicals.  Since the only correct way to straighten is with roller brush and heat, this is very impressive tool to do exactly that, continuously roiling the hair with heat.  The roller goes in both directions at your desired level, and control of heat.  The incorporated brush sounds simply enough, but is the answer to getting the shine.The list price is okay, but my opinion is that is needs to be about 20% less.  But due to the quality and the fact you would pay this amount or more for a stylist to do it once, it is worth every penny.If you are not getting the shiny flowing straight hair result, you are not holding the hair tight enough.  Start as close to the root as possible and don't overload the chamber.  The length is there for wrapping.  Not straightening.  You should not be working more than 2"" width of hair and keep the hair taught all the way to the end.  If you're hair is sagging at all during this, you will burn your hair.  If you have very long hair, you have a lot of work to do, and the length of your arms will be tough.  Just don't do a portion of a section.  If you cannot handle the length, you will need to get a friend to do it for you.  Someone that is not afraid of pulling your hair tight.  Your hair should not be wet when using the iron.  You should use a roller brush and blow dry your hair just a bit.  Then use the iron.  And finish by blowing with a roller brush again so the strands are loose and flowing.It's not a professional tool, to me, but close.  I'm not sure how long the ionic bristles will last, but for home use, it should last quite a while.  There are very important features that seem simple, but the fact the power cord is 6' long and swivels means you will not get tangled, and will be able to get to any angle easily.  The handle is comfortable and ergonomic which helps since this process takes a while.  But it takes half the time than just using a brush and dryer.  Use an alcohol free gel before ironing, and your work will last a few days.  Wear a hair net to bed, and not a hat or scarf as your hair needs to breath and sweat will ruin your work.  Extend it even more with dry spray shampoo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUJN50YQGZZHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5N5KZO#wasThisHelpful","RUJN50YQGZZHG","A1WXG10FJ353K0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WXG10FJ353K0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sadly I was among the few that received an advanced copy of the Mayor's book, and while reading it, he passed. It certainly brought a higher level of emotion as we examine how much the man did for so many, without one word of boasting.  There was a reason he made history winning a fifth term of my great city. He was loved.Mayor Menino was never about politics or party.  He was truly about the people.  From 1993, I remember my career in Boston just starting to take off and as he took office, you could immediately see the changes in employment, education and the quality of the city in general.  We had some really rough areas before he got into office.  So many high profile neighborhoods and business locations were dangerous.  Streets of filth, homelessness, drugs, violence, prostitution and the ""combat zone"". There will always be issues with homeless and crimes, but it certainly got better for many.  You never see crime in the city anymore.  You feel safe walking anywhere at night.  And the combat zone or porn theaters and sex shops are just plane gone.  What took over was our thriving theater district giving NYC something to look out for.  All really just a taste of the good he did for our city.Our thriving economy due to President Clinton can also be connected to Mayor Menino.  They worked well together, and everything was perfect until the bush years.  But even so, he pulled us through.  Jobs were threatened, but not the people.  A disaster was taking place across the country, but he kept our city above water.Massachusetts is proud to be the first state for marriage equality.  Such a controversial issue, but he showed the ignorant that love is love.  The support for the gay community is widely unappreciated.  There is so much acceptance in jobs and living in general in the city, and he so encouraged people to be who they are.  Nothing was about gay rights.  It was about civil rights.  He recognized the difference and it was never a gay issue.  Just equality.  He even officiated weddings and supported all students to have pride, no matter what lifestyle they lived.  It is such a great example of how he truly loved his city, the people, and expression.It's is upsetting to think about the Boston Marathon bombing.  Not only for the city to be in such shock and fear, but knowing the Mayor's health was failing.  He was in so much physical pain, but demanded to stand for his city.  It was horrible and extraordinary.  Governor Patrick knows the importance of the man, and I wanted to leave this quote:Mayor Menino started Monday morning frustrated he couldnt be at the finish line this time, as he always is, and then late that afternoon checked himself out of the hospital to help this city, our city, face down this tragedy.It's just one more example of how he was our rock.  Our anchor.  Our friend.This is not a memoir putting himself on a pedestal, even though we put him there. It is a side we never saw.  His true feelings of all the great experiences the city has seen, be it good or bad.  He reveals so much more about how he found strength to accomplish so much.I cannot even tell you the name of our new Mayor.  I don't even care to google it.  He was forgotten as soon as he took office.This is required reading for all leaders, or those who think they are leaders.  This is how it's done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF6AIYE0L8S92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544302494#wasThisHelpful","RF6AIYE0L8S92","A1WXG10FJ353K0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WXG10FJ353K0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off... perfect timing!  New England has been going through waves of extreme weather, cold winds and rain.  Just like today.  It's a mess outside.  Cold and damp inside.  So I opened the box, plugged it in, put the included Duracell batteries in the remote, and was up and running in a minute.  The controls are simple.  Power button, arrow up and down to select temperature, or select a temperature and set a timer.  I set it to 67, it went from 61 to 67 in less than five minutes, filling a room to a comfortable atmosphere.  You can hear the fan, but it's not an intrusive sound.  If playing stereo or TV, you don't notice.  In fact, in bedroom, the sound is a nice white noise.I was concerned with the air intake and it picking up dust etc, but there is a washable filter easily removed from the back from a flip-down cover.  There is no heat concern to the unit itself.  It's very safe and secure.An appealing aspect is that this is actually a nice piece of furniture.  Made of solid hardwoods and real wood veneers. A very heavy piece, however, the hidden casters makes moving it along the floor super easy.  From room to room, Grandma and move it with no problem, nor will she be confused on how to use it.  Scratch the wood along the way?  They were nice enough to include a matching furniture scratch marker.At 1500 Watts, I am not sure how the energy consumption will hurt the electric bill.  However, with the quick response in filling a room and automatic shutoff thermostat, I am confident this would help save fuel costs.  My primary heat is oil, and I am looking forward to using this unit in the coming months.  And it looks nice as opposed to an ugly space heater.The export area of heat is not one of those fake flames things.  It does glow orange in the opening, but doe not project light to distract.  It's a very comfortable unit that is easy to use, and would recommend to anyone looking for a secondary heater.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EJNS5KU3PRK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K172SVG#wasThisHelpful","R1EJNS5KU3PRK3","A1WXG10FJ353K0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WXG10FJ353K0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used a few variations of Maca before, and buying it is tough as not all are the same.  It depends on the variety which could be black, red, and in this case, yellow.  There are forms in capsules, but I like the raw aspect and finding various uses.  It is most certainly an acquired taste, as it really is it's own.  So I can only put it in a family of flavors based on nuts, harvest and cider.  To me, it's a perfect Autumn ingredient.  I go with what I taste and build on it, and it leads to a few different uses.For smoothies, it's an excellent additive.  Especially in a protein shake.  I enjoy a combination of ground flax, cacao, peanut powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, chia, coconut water, a slash of soy milk, agave and heaping teaspoon of the maca powder.  Blend with ice, and it's a nice wake up.The smell of this Maca powder is quite unique.  It inspired me to make a pumpkin soup.  Honestly, all the above ingredients except the cacao and ice, blended, with a bit more chia, add a little minced onion and parsley, heated, was a surprisingly tasty soup on the first try.I also tried broiling chicken breast by making a ""breading"" of flax flour, Maca powder and sesame seeds, dipping the chicken breast in soy milk and coating with the mixture.  Baking at 400 for about 15 minutes.  Quite good with a side of squash.The quality is top notch, and a generous supply.  Only a teaspoon needed per serving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TAPK47AWG361/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HES7572#wasThisHelpful","R1TAPK47AWG361","A1WXG10FJ353K0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WXG10FJ353K0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a big fan of the Pure Protein, but keep trying their products thinking it all can't be bad.  I've tried several of their protein bars in the past and all have been quite awful to the point of not being able to complete an entire bar, and wasting the rest.  So far ""S'mores"", ""Peanut Butter, Caramel Surprise"" and various ""Chocolate Peanut Butter"" types all have been intolerable.  I decided to give their canned shakes a try, and, well, yuck.  Frosty Chocolate (Pack of 12) and I managed to get down two in a couple weeks. It's nasty chalk water.  I used it for a smoothie base to not waste them, but it's so watery that it does not blend well.. and it's already blended.So this was my next attempt at this line with a small tub of protein powder.  Not sure where ""Mixed Berry"" comes into play, but it's okay as a base for a fruit smoothie.  Drinking on it's own is not so great, but blending with greens and frozen banana makes it more tolerable with less odd sweet aftertaste.  There are plenty of mixes and additives that make such drinks unpleasant.  But a protein shake should have the ability to be enjoyed with a simple mix with water.I didn't totally hate this product because it serves a purpose.  The protein source is good, and nutrient additives are fine.  It also remains low fat and sugars.  So it's not so bad if you are creative.  But when I get a protein powder, I want it to be easy to use and enjoy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KT3VB3PTT2T0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KS6X3FU#wasThisHelpful","R3KT3VB3PTT2T0","A1WXG10FJ353K0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WXG10FJ353K0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Corel has really stepped up to the plate in the last couple years. Wisely watching the missteps of Adobe, and not following their path.  But this pretty much gives them a home run. I have used Photoshop for many years, then, Adobe happened.  Basically tolerated it, but no more. Software like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop etc. has been replaced by CorelDRAW, Paint Shop Pro and a suite of Corel editing and creation tools. Now their amazing Painter outdoes itself.  No subscription obligation required.First off, if you have a Wacom tablet, buy this software yesterday.  If you don't, you will want one after you play with this in a matter of minutes.  Though a tablet is not necessary with plenty you can do with your mouse, the control of a pen makes this absolutely perfect.This is obviously great for professional use, but it is also just fine for budding artists.  I actually also recommend getting this for children.  The creative freedom here is endless.  Also, if you give it to a 10 year old, you'll have someone to teach you!  Don't underestimate the child's mind.  I say this because once you begin the program you will be overwhelmed with so much, you might think it's over your head.  Beginners can simplify their fears and go at their own pace.  You will see the only overwhelming aspect is that there are a bazillion brushes and tools to choose from.  Just click and play around.  You can save your favorite brushes etc. for easy access.  You won't ruin any image.  If you make an error or something you don't like, you can undo anything or start over.  There is definitely a lot to learn, but you truly learn by doing here.I am using the program on my MacBook Pro 2012, 2.7 GHz, 16gb memory, Intel HD Graphics 4000 1024 MB. I have had the software for almost a month, and have been running the OS X Yosemite (beta and new) and having no problems, freezing or crashing.  Very fast response and no lag, so there is a flawless flow of brushing and drawing.The variety of brush categories are endless as there are sub categories as well.  But there are also many special effects giving you access to create with patterns and color mixes. Also playing with photos is fun with features like tracing paper and making a painting out of any photo. There are some software programs out there that just create painting effects on photos, but you dont have any creative input.  With Painters version, you still have access to all the brushes and the tracing paper allows you to be as detailed as you would like.There is an app in the Apple app store called Cinco for Painter by Corel, but apparently they have no plans on updating it for 2015 since its last update was 2012.  It would be great to have the mobile app.  There is supposedly and app specifically for Android, but I do not have access.  I have Kindle HDX and its not available.  Maybe its coming soon.  And so far no books that I can find for training.  But, again, you really do learn by just using it.  You teach yourself easily, but be patient.

"This infuser is specifically for the Autoseal West Loop travel mug line, and it's the perfect accessory for premium tea lovers.  No more teabags and mess.  The clever design is very well made and securely clicks under the mug lid.  The infuser is well made and includes a quality plastic cup cover.  You can use the cup to put the infuser in to stop steeping and catch drips.  If you are going somewhere that you have hot water, and just fill the infuser with tea and brew when you are ready.  You can also reuse the previous tea leaves to refill.  So there are many elements of travel use.  Feel safe to throw in a bag, or desk drawer etc.  Of course keeping it hot is key, and the mug needed it retains heat for about 4-5 hours. So it makes for a great pair.

"Clever.  It reminds me of something that would be on Shark Tank.  But would they take it seriously?  Sure, why not?  However, this concept needs to be adjusted and improved.You get a lot of pieces, but essentially you are getting 6 caps for what is currently a list price of 20 bucks. 15 would be more acceptable.  10 would make it a known household item.  I am thinking doubling the content, getting rid of the useless bag, and a plastic tub to keep them clean.  But, with that said, the plastic pull tops do not feel like they are going to last. The quality of of dish detergent bottle is better in comparison.  So we are are paying for the legs so things stand up.  The point.All the pieces help you get the right fit for your ketchup, syrups, soaps and other things that would be easier to use if upside down.  However, I don't like the fact that the pull tops may touch the surfaces.  The legs need to be higher.  If anything, it's the legs that need to be adjustable.  Even if they flipped up and down.  So, I don't like using them with consumable items.  Telling us to boil them before use in the instructions was a bit odd as well.  They are supposed to be dishwasher safe, but I wouldn't.The last issue would be the washers (gaskets) that are merely styrofoam rings that will never last.  You slide them into the caps to help keep the liquid from leaking. There are extra washers included, but enough for one replacement each.  Clearly a rubber washer would have been the lasting choice. The price deducts a star, the questionable longevity another, and replacement pieces sold separately, the third star.I think anyone looking at this, in person, or even just the photos could not answer this question positively...would you pay over 3 bucks to cap one bottle of ketchup that probably will not last and will need replacement rings?No.This company makes drain stoppers, and they look interesting.  They are made of stainless steel with rubber gaskets.  Not THAT would make more sense for this product.  Plus it would give the item bottom weight. And they would last for years.  That is an item I would pay up to 8 bucks for each cap.

"I was not expecting much from a vacuum at this price point, but I am pleasantly surprised.  If you have a room or area that is hard to get to with your regular vacuum, then this is a solution.  Even if you don't have room for it in that area, it is so light that you won't struggle to get it there.  We are using it for a hallway entry that is annoying to clean with the regular machine.The most important thing with me personally is that it does not trigger my allergies.  And, it does not.  So far so good.  It has great suction and does not expel dust.  The unit requires bags (UD30010) and though I have not needed to change the bag yet, it is very secure and easy to discard without risk of spill.  However, it will still be removed outside.I would suggest that it would be a great machine for use in a dorm.  Not much space, and easy to use.  But maybe the bags would be a bad thing for students to deal with. But it's also a good choice for elderly that have mobility issues.  Once again, the unit being light is a major plus here, and it does a lot of work without much effort.Even at the list price, it is quite a bargain.  If it breaks, it not much of a loss compared to repairing or replacing a higher end machine.

"My Father is 71 and does not deal well with change.  He has been welding countless things of all types all my life.  Never as a primary business.  Mainly as an obsessive hobby.  Not only to repair or service machinery but also to create artistically in various forms mostly in sculpture.  I realized that I don't remember him ever using any other helmet except the one the same one that looks like it came out of a bad 60s sci-fi movie.  So I decided to get this because I knew he would hold nothing back and tell me how bad it was.When I first showed him the package, he laughed hysterically and went back to work. ""Very funny"".  Clearly thinking it was a toy and was humored by the flames.  But once I convince him to try it, I told him I would read the directions with him.  After a few mumbles under his breath putting the thing on, he took me to the garage.  He sparked up and had no idea what he was supposed to do and then instantly realized its doing it for him.  Amazed at the automatic darkening and he loved that he did not have to remove or lift it constantly.  A clear view when safe, and adjusts to all conditions to protect.  He loves that he can adjust to his preferences and I pretty much will never see it again.  I told him about the  solar power aspect, so he has it set on a hook near the window.The helmet looks pretty cool on.  If its your gig, its a must buy. Initially we were concerned about the lightweight feel and plastic aspect, but the thing is super durable, and the weight is obviously a big plus.

"Dear GREENPEACE:I just want you to know that as a supporter of Greenpeace for decades, I have had just about enough of your ignorance and juvenile actions.  You no longer represent me or my beliefs.You are doing more harm than good by recruiting trolls exclaiming ""rabble rabble rabble!"" with no purpose, just to abuse the review and rating system of a cell phone.  You ignorant freaks send hundreds of these trolls to rate a product they do not own, and know nothing about WHY they are rating it as such. Talk about ""dirty energy""!It is a discussion.  Not a freaking game.  Amazon and it's head staff, founders and developers have done more for the environment than Greenpeace has ever done.  If you got your heads out of your arses you would be able to see that.So continue your stupid slanderous campaign, as each day continues to devalue your organization and embarrass all that supported you in the past or present.  Clearly all these kids needed something to do with their time when not folding shirts at Hot Topic.I believe this is the end of your organization and you deserve every backlash there is that will bring you down.I regret every dollar and minute of my time ever devoted to your ""organization"".Amazon is surely going to address this abuse, the allegations and accusations.  I trust this company and it's ultimate purpose and they do not deserve any of this ridiculous harassment.Based on the plethora of negative reviews, I will now consider buying the Amazon Fire Phone, because I know Amazon stands behind their product.  I also know that if I am not happy in any way, they will always make it right.PROOF that Greacepeace is the cause of the negative reviews, due to a flooding campaign by David Pomerantz ""Greenpeace USA Senior Energy Campaigner"":us.greenpeace.org/site/TellAFriend?msgId=43061.2In case Greenpeace removes the page, here is all of the text reply you get after submitting your letter to Jeff Bezos that they wrote for you:-----------------------------------------------------------Friend -Thank you for telling Amazon's Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos to finally come clean about his company's energy performance and environmental impact. Making this information public is the first step to getting Amazon to clean up its act.And the more the company hears from its customers, the quicker it will happen. Let's take this to the next level by talking to Amazon in the one language we absolutely know it understands: product reviews!HELP flood Amazon.com with 1-star reviews for their first ever smartphone, the Amazon Fire.Why the Fire? The recently released Fire phone's major boast is its unlimited cloud data storage ... but there's a BIG catch. Unlike Apple's iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy, Amazon's cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.Amazon's Fire's reliance on dirty energy isn't cutting edge, and it's completely unnecessary. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn't mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities. Apple, Facebook, and Google have figured out how to store our photos and music with renewable energy, and so can Amazon. These reviews will show Amazon that it's time to move to modern energy sources and make a ""smarter phone"" supported by clean, renewable energy.Do you have an Amazon.com account? Great! Now, take these TWO easy steps to tell Amazon to shape up:1) Copy the following review (or just write your own):It's time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire's reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.2) Click HERE to leave a 1-star review on the Amazon Fire Phone product page:Pssst ... don't forget to click ""one"" star when you paste your review. And you may need to log into your Amazon.com account first before accessing the review page.Thank you again for taking action. Time and time again we've seen that your support makes a big difference in getting companies like Amazon to embrace better policies. As an Amazon.com customer, it's important they hear from you directly.For a greener internet and future,David PomerantzGreenpeace USA Senior Energy Campaigner-----------------------------------------------------------","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KL3MWBOG8GJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EODYW6M#wasThisHelpful","R2KL3MWBOG8GJ","A1WXG10FJ353K0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WXG10FJ353K0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent quality for instant photo printing.  The ability to print a crisp photo up to 8""x10"" so quickly is impressive.  Take a photo with your ironed, use the app to send to your printer wirelessly and have it hanging on the wall in an 8""x10"" frame in moments.  It also makes an awesome personal birthday card you forgot to buy.  Or a card for any occasion.Of course you can print standard paper documents.  I suggest setting the unit to monochrome to save the color inks.  The cartridge cost could add up quickly if you don't make sure you are not using the colors.The unit does not take much space at all.  Of course you have the ability to make document copies.  Or scan an existing photo to save as a file for uploading or printing the photo after editing or restoring.I love that I don't have to deal with my computer at all to use the unit.  Using a tablet or phone is cool, but printing from any desktop or laptop in the house wirelessly works flawlessly.  You can also print right to social media, but I prefer editing and uploading myself.The only cons are the ink cartridges.  Luckily you can buy black separately and have the option to just use black, but don't remove the color cartridges.  But the color comes in a set for about 40 bucks.  Just make sure you use black as much as possible to retain the color for photo use.  The other is the Fax.  I have not tried it because why would I?  Do people still fax anything anymore?","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R187CT2ASK49PA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV97KYS#wasThisHelpful","R187CT2ASK49PA","A1WXG10FJ353K0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WXG10FJ353K0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Definitely a unique, secure binder.  There is a canvas zippered core keeping everything together, but the rest is plastic.  The interior with seven sections.  These are not folders, just dividers.  So it is anything other than a standard size page, it could slide down and settle to the bottom.  I don't really care for that, but since it is zippered, I don't have to worry about anything falling out.  I got it for bills and important documents.  Paper and storage is becoming more useless every day, so I figured a simple accordion binder would do the trick.  It will serve it's purpose.  If I had a lot of checks to deal with, that would be an issue due to the lack of folder aspect.  But I can't remember the last time I wrote or got a check.  The separating tabs are peculiar.  They don't remove, but you can raise the yellow tabs to be higher than the others.  To serve as a reminder.  And when completed, push the tab down. Not really anything special.  There are paper inserts you will have to finagle recreating or overlapping labels.  No extras.  The red is helpful in ease of finding in case of misplacing it.  The colored part is a harder plastic, and the clear part is not as durable.  This is not something for a backpack in my eyes.  It's too big,would get crushed, and the weather and use will have this cracking with falling apart.  But for home use, it's fine.  It's actually fits just fine on the bookshelf leaving more space by getting rid of larger alternatives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RB3XCS56LMU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052S3ACK#wasThisHelpful","R3RB3XCS56LMU5","A1WXG10FJ353K0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WXG10FJ353K0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Herbal Essences has always been a safe choice for me as I cannot deal with heavy scents without reaction.  Otherwise, I try to find something with no fragrance.  But this unique mix of grapefruit and mint is very appealing and leaves your scalp and hair feeling and smelling fresh.  I have thick hair to begin with, but it is softer with a fluffy feel, but still manageable.  I ordered the volumizing souffle that accompanies this conditioner, but my order was cancelled as I believe they ran out.  But after trying just this product, I would be interested in the entire line, even if just this scent.  I tend to latch on to products that don't react on me.  My allergies are respiratory, not dermal.  And the slightest fragrance in soaps and detergents etc. can set me off.  So this was a pleasant, refreshing surprise.

"With only a little diagram card in a ""no frustration"" (plain) box, you are on your own to get these on right.  Luckily they go on easy and well made.  After cleaning and drying the phone, I also cleaned my fingers with alcohol. This will prevent fingerprints from the underside.  The protective sticky side peels off well with a handy tab.  Holding the strip on it's edges and folding slightly the long way toward the phone, placing it from top to bottom, you are pretty much going to have a safe landing the first time. I had to peel back a couple corners for minor bubbles.  Using the heat of your finger to push the from the inside out works well.  I do have an edge that just wont fully stick, but is not noticeable when I put the case on.  My 4 pack were 4 sleeves of two sheets each, so a total of 8 sheets. I don't know if that was a mistake, but if that is normal, it's a great deal for the price.  4 sheets for ten bucks, not so much.

"If you have limited space, would like a ton of printing abilities, and afraid of setup nightmares, this one is for you.  So easy to run with a quick start guide and connecting wireless is a breeze.Not just a printer, but scanner, photo copier, fax (as if we need it anymore), and not only can you print from any computer (I have both PC and Mac) you can even use apps to print from any phone or tablet.The scary thing about printer shopping is buying the ink.  You think you get a deal on a printer and then you soon find out they are robbing you with expensive cartridges.  The prices for this unit are not that bad. More importantly, the ink lasts longer that any compact printer I have had or tried in the past.  Just a tip,  remember to print everything in monochrome as black and white will cost less and last even longer.The controls are easy to understand with a helpful screen to assist you instead of figuring out what a dozen buttons are suppose to do.This is for home office use, and not a business buy.  It would meet all the needs of a small home business, ebay, etc. at a very reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OADFMRRA2US3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGESY#wasThisHelpful","R1OADFMRRA2US3","A1WXG10FJ353K0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WXG10FJ353K0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a die-hard Grand Theft Auto fan.  So much so that I bought a new Playstation for each release.  I buy a lot of different games, and some are played once and never played again.  I just keep going back to GTA.  I don't consider myself a big gamers, but I have just gotten used to the mechanics of this type of game.Thankfully Watch Dogs feels like an extension of GTA, but not really.  It's unique.  Although the ""cell phone"" integration and ""hacking"" is a bit annoying at times.  But I enjoy the free roaming aspect, and hate limitations when I can't walk a free world setting.  You can walk around but need to complete missions to obtain various abilities.  So you are pretty much forced to play the game storyline... except there is not much of a story.  And driving is certainly not as smooth as GTA, but overall, it's worth buying when it gets to the ""hits"" price.  Not the list price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TKKG0L0PQC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGHUS58#wasThisHelpful","R3TKKG0L0PQC2","A1WXG10FJ353K0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WXG10FJ353K0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are definitely better and more elaborate bags and carts out there, but this is quite a bargain for it's durability.  Light but sturdy, and always a conversation starter.  Everyone wants it once they see it.  Very funny.As long as you are not playing in the woods, you are good to go.  Just because the ""realtree"" print is just that, real.  All pockets, zippers, wheels and straps feel built to last.  It's actually a great bag to drag around since it would not matter if it got dirty etc. It moves well, looks cool and sturdy.

"For years I have enjoyed my Bodum presses, like there was no other.  But never really enjoyed the cleanup process.This is far better than a Bodum for many reasons.  Not only does it make a great pot of coffee, but it keeps it hot, and it's a simple rinse cleanup.My only suggestion is that mornings tend to be cooler, therefore, steel would be cool.  Pour some of the boiling water in the carafe for a minute and warm it up.

There is a coating on the inside and out so that they don't tarnish but I've used this several times and it has stayed totaly prestine. I'm so glad that I did get to order this mug to try it out.

"I'm an aromatherapy junkie. I love it and I love trying new scents. I never tried Bergamot and so decided I needed to add this to my massive collection of essential oils. Especially after I read up on it and found out the many uses for it. Since I'm getting ready for surgery tomorrow (Sept 3rd is my bilateral double mastectomy with reconstruction) I've been using Bergamot Essential Oil in my diffusers to help me relax, help me destress and help my anxiety. My Doctor did prescribe me an antianxiety medication but I hate taking additional medications so figured I'd try this to see how it goes. I'm surprised at the scent. It's definitely a cross between citrus and floral. I'm not too much of a fan of floral but there are certain floral scents I do enjoy like Lavender and Geranium.This is not a bad scent at all. In fact it was quite pleasing. It's also not at all overpowering and I love how I need only about 8 drops in my largest diffuser to invigorate the air with this scent. As I try and relax today the day before surgery I know that I will be okay and this is helping me keep from really stressing out or having to take any anxiety medication. That said it truly works fantastically.It also has some medicinal uses as an antiseptic for cuts. I did get a cut on the bottom of my big right toe and it truly worked great on that.I highly recommend this scent Bergamot for anyone who loves essential oils and who wants to destress. Even if you don't have a diffuser you can always boil a pot of water on the stove, let it settle then add about 5-10 drops depending on the size of the pot (I'm talking up to about a 2qt pot) and put a towel over your head and breathe it in. Works great this way too.I did get this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I really love this Professional Cafe Luxe Milk Frother. It's very easy to use.  And it's made or real stainless steal NOT plastic. I've owned several portable models and most are made of a cheap plastic where it will NOT last. This is not the case for this Cafe Lux Milk Frother.  You can now make all sorts of cafe drinks like Latte's in the comfort of your own home and the money you'll save by making them for pennies on the dollar is so incredible that this item will pay for itself very shortly and many times over.It runs on 2 AA batteries that this company includes and they give you Duracell batteries NOT cheap batteries. After all, a premium frother deserves premium batteries.If you're buying this I highly recommend that you also buy the Cafe Lux Milk Frothing Pitcher which is also premium quality (I also wrote a nice review on that product). When you have both the pitcher and this frother you can be your own flawless barista. And you're sure to be the hit of your own parties making drinks everyone thought was only possible to get at those high dollar coffee houses.I love that this is 2 speeds for making a wide variety of frothed drinks and I like how easy it is to clean. Just wipe the part that goes into the drink with warm soapy water and rinse it in cool water. Shake so no water gets into the housing which is NOT waterproof.The stainless on this frother is metal and if you're looking for an ideal gift for a housewarming or wedding for a person who loves coffees or lattes or any sort of coffee type of drinks this is ideal and highly affordable.I did get this frother free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review..all of the opinions expressed within this review are 100% my own and are based on my own experiences using this product and I was not compensated in any other way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN5XH4AG9J1OM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RM2C4SA#wasThisHelpful","RN5XH4AG9J1OM","A3984G9B5FXH64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3984G9B5FXH64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely LOVE this Portable Mini LED Speedlite. It's so easy to use. All you do is charge it with the USB Charging cord that's included in the box for about 60-90 minutes. Then you just plug it in the phone where your Headset Jack is at . Turn on the button on the left as you're looking at the LED Flash bulbs inside the flash and turn it on. You can keep the light on for about 60 continuous minutes. It's great when you're having a barbecue or party that's outdoors at night and you don't want to rely on the small dim flash of your smartphone. I have used this numerous times and I love that it stays on to give me extra light where extra light is needed and then I can just fit it back into my pocket when I'm done using it. This little device has 3 rows of 7 across LED Bulbs that when it lights up it is like having a mini spotlight on your smartphone. It even works great in conjunction with a selfie stick.To charge it is very easy it has it's own USB charger so you put the smaller end into the top of the device and the USB into any USB charger be it a laptop, or car charger or even a power bank to recharge it. It takes about 60-90 minutes. The first time I charged mine after running it down,(it came charged) it took me 73 minutes to fully charge it up, not bad at all since it did last me 64 minutes being continuously lit. (I did this to see how long it would take before the ""lights went out"".).I'm very pleased with this device and how it handles etc. This is perfect for camping trips, hikes, vacations, or just about any time you want to take a picture with not the ideal lighting. This will definitely bring the colors to the forefront.This is one of only a handful of items I would give over a 5 star review if allowed to do so . It is that wonderful an item and one that everyone with any sort of digital camera, smartphone, etc should have in their accessory kit!I was given this product free, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I love my Armband for my Samsung Galaxy S5. It even fit my old Samsung Galaxy S3 and fits my son's iPhone 6 ..It did NOT fit my daughter's iPhone 6 Plus though .What i do like is the fact that my phone is well protected while I work out. That If I have to use the touchpad instead of just using my bluetooth or headset or even my portable bluetooth speaker to answer my phone the plastic is thick enough to keep the sweat and moisture away from the phone, but thin enough I can actually use the touchpad as needed. A lot of these armbands' plastics are so thick that it makes it very hard to use the touchpad , and I'm happy to say this is not the case with the URPPOWER Armband. I also like that I can put my locker key or lock key into the key spot on the armband though it will NOT fit most modern day car keys.If you're not using a set of bluetooth headphones it also has a way to fit it into the armband so that it's not all over the place.This I found is not only great for when I'm at the gym, but it's also great for camping, hiking, and even while walking around those amusement parks. Keep in mind that while it is sweatproof it isn't waterproof so please don't think you can go to the beach or pool and swim with this on your arm. You can't (well you can if you don't mind messing up your phone in the process, which is something that I do NOT recommend).All in all it's a great quality band with the neoprene and velcro making it easy to put on , take off , and adjust.I'd recommend this to anyone wanting an armband for their phone with the exception of those having an iPhone 6 Plus.I did receive this product for free, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"These scrabble tiles to me are like education and money in the bank! I don't use them to replace scrabble tiles per say. NO. I use them to get my grandson interested in learning!

He is at the age where bodily function sounds are funny to him too! EX:When we play operation it's the new version and instead of a funny bone there's water on the knee that sounds like a dripping faucet and there's a toilet flushing sound and a fart sound. He thinks this is hilarious! So....What does Nana Sunni do? I taught him how to spell  with rhying ...Tart, Cart, and of course what else? Fart!!! He thinks that's hilarious too and he is reading .Then what do we do with the numbers on the bottom of each tile? We add them together! Now in addition to reading and learning to spell he's adding and we're also learning to subtract! He thinks it's all a game but this Nana Sunni knows better! He's learning something that will take him into the future. It's a skill. Learning doesn't have to be boring..I'm showing him it can be FUN!!! Feel free to use these techniques with your children or grandkids.

"This car mount is miles above the competition. First of all I love how long the neck is and how durable it is as well. Secondly it plugs right into the outlet charger in your car so that you dont have it wasting space on your windshield, your dashboard or pulling down the vent slots on the a/c vents in your car. While other Car Mounts do the same thing that's the end of the similarities. Now for the differences. This one in addition to being magnetic also has 3 USB slots on the Base of where you plug it into the car charger in your car. This way you can charge your phone AND also two additional USB Devices. Be it a tablet , another cellphone, or an MP4 player, digital camera or more you can charge any 3 devices at once. I love that they give you the option of a plate that's totally magnetic or one that has a tape to put on the back of a phone or phone case in order to hold it to the magnetic part of the adapter. This truly is a wonderfully crafted device and one that is very durable and will last. Plus you're not putting any wear and tear on your vent slots.One other ting I like about this car mount is that it has blue indicator led light when you plug it into the car charger so you can see it  in the dark . It's always helpful when they have a blue indicator light.One safety feature I truly like is that it has an over voltage and over current protection so that it won't break out in a fire. That's what I call safety first.I did get this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"These are a really nice pair of cutting utensils. I like how I can use one end to literally open a bottle cap if I need to. I've also taken apart the two pieces of the scissors and used them as separate knives to cut into some of my herbs. I've used the back to try and crack walnuts but it will take some getting used to and they repeatedly slipped from my grasp, which is why I am giving this a 4 star review.The holder does fit the scissors when put together nicely and it does have a rather large magnet but even with this larger magnet it still slips down the side of my refrigerator for a bit till it stops. Perhaps if they put a longer magnet in addition to the round magnet down the back of it (there's room to do this) then it would hold much better). The plastic handles are comfortable for cutting and I was able to slice through some ribs without any issues so it was brought from a 3 star product back up to a 4 star product.I also love that the metal is made of stainless steel so that it should last for many years to come without any rust.I did get this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is a really fun things to do with the kids. My grandson had a lot of fun watching a roller coaster in 3D. He literally thought he was a part of the action and to me that's priceless especially since I can no longer go on roller coasters with my bad back and neck.I love all the various places we were able to go with this and the codes to scan were a lot of fun. We (my grandson Vincent and I had a lot of fun with this and the fact that it brought my old toy to a new technological level that he can have fun with was a lot of fun as well.To imagine being able to go to the moon or places we'd never go to the North Pole , etc and now we can do that from the comfort of our living room and do it all in 3D just using a cardboard w/ a magnifier and our own smart phone and some QR codes and apps.I highly recommend this to anyone with a smartphone.

"I have several TaoTronics electronics and I'm a huge fan. I love their scanners for my ex-husband's business. When he past away I got to go through all of the sheds with all of his ""Stock"" (he was in construction, owned his own business, and also had parts on hand as he was also a handyman). The one thing Jimmy was NOT was organized. These barcode scanners truly helped me get organized. I've scanned in tons of parts for various jobs like fixing washers and dryers, refrigerators and a/c units etc. I literally had walls and walls of various items and no way to inventory them except on paper until I got this scanner. I love that it is wireless and only takes USB to charge it up and it has a little data transfer so you can transfer your data from one device to another very easily.I especially love that TaoTronics products always comes with very detailed and in depth owners manuals and that they have 24/7 technical support via email. It's never hard to get in touch with TaoTronics. And they're always eager to help. This company is truly one of my all time favorite companies on Amazon.com because of how it treats its customers. Customer Service is #1 With this company! This owner's manual is so very detailed I highly recommend that anyone who purchases this scanner put this in a safe place and upload it to your pc and then download it onto a disc just for safe keeping. It has that much information and I've taken a few pictures of only some of the information you'd find inside the owner's manual for your convenience.This is very lightwight and fits comfortably in my hand. I was also able to get a lot more done as far as inventorying his parts and the warehouse in a matter of minutes compared to what would have taken me hours or even days if done by hand. I love that this is wireless so I'm not tethered to my laptop. I've gotten through his entire inventory of parts so that we can sell it and all the proceeds donated to the American Cancer Society per his wishes.Next up is to inventory both of our movies. We literally have hundreds if not thousands of movies that I'd like to inventory so that I don't have to have duplicates and those that do have duplicates I can sell to raise even more money for charity.I was given this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

" 6:09 Mins This Coolife 4way Garden Hose Splitter is by far the best I've EVER used in my life. I love how the housing is made of a rubber NOT a cheap plastic. The insides are insulated and how this is both heat and cold resistant. This way it won't crack if you forget to take it down in  extreme heat or cold. (I would recommend you taking it off when that happens as soon as possible though to avoid any damage).The fact that you can have 4 different hoses to water your lawn in 4 different areas and have a manual shut off for each and every hose is fantastic. No other splitter I've owned has EVER come this well made.I did put together a video to explain how this is used and how it works.

"I really and truly absolutely love this Coolife Garden Hose , Nozzle and Sprayer. First of all I love how easy it was to hook onto my hose. (Righty Tighty and lefty loosy) and it stayed on without any issues. I took it off to take pictures since my cellphone fell in a puddle as I was trying to take pictures of this with my cellphone! (I know just my luck). Anyway I had to take pics w/ my laptop so I unhooked it and that was just as easy to do and then I dried it off b4 bringing it into my home.I love that it has 8 different jet patterns. They are: CONE, JET, CENTER, MIST, SHOWER, RINSE, FLAT, SOAKER.I like this for watering my flowers and roses or filling a pail with water and then washing my car. it makes the work of washing the car a lot more fun especially when I use the Soaker pattern to rinse off the soap and the Cone pattern for getting my car wet to begin with. What I even like about this nozzle is how clearly each click is marked along the side of the nozzle so you KNOW what spray pattern you're using or about to use. To squeeze a lot of nozzles can be hard, especially with hands that have RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) or anyone with limited mobility of their hands. This has given me zero problems since day one. It's easy to squeeze the handle without feeling like I'm in a war with the nozzle.It's insulated so there are no leaks and I checked it top to bottom for any signs of leakage and there weren't any.I'm very pleased with the quality of this Coolife Garden Hose, Nozzle Sprayer and I'm sure you will be too.I: did get this item free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"These toe sleeves are wonderful. Sometimes My toes hurt from walking alot or if I cut a toenail incorrectly they can really hurt for days. And when that happens it can hurt just to put a sock on my foot and heaven forbid if it touches the toe. Now I no longer worry. I just put on the toe sleeves and then put on my sock and my problem is solved. They are very comfortable to wear too. Whether it's on for a few minutes or several hours they stay in place and make my toes feel comfortable and I can walk and get through the day without any issues.

"I really like this kit for my car. Unfortunately my interior is black so it won't show up so well so I decided to just take pictures and talk about the individual products that come with this unique car accessories bundle set.I love the 2 black pockets that fit towards the console and beside your seat. It should fit most standard vehicles. I love how you can move it around to fit your vehicle. Once in place the entire idea is that anything you drop from crumbs to french fries to business cards and more will get caught in the pocket and won't fall through to the floor below and underneath your seat. It mikes life a lot easier to clean up a pocket then to have to fish things out one at a time underneath the seat.The next thing you have is a black tacky gel item. I suppose you can use  it to hold a phone but my phone was too heavy. It's very tacky on both sides and I've kept the plastic so when I removed it can put it back when I'm done doing this review into my car. I like it for holding a business card or some loose change for when we travel on the road for the toll booths.Once you put it on your dash it will pretty much stay in place as it is that tacky both on the outside and the inside of the gel pack.Finally it comes with a unique BABY ON BOARD sign. I've got one grandson whose 5 years old and if I called him a baby he'd most definitely correct me. That said my daughter and her husband are trying for baby #2 . When and if that happens I'll be using this for my car whenever I transport the little guy/gal. That said I'll keep it and put it up for when it's needed.All and all this is a nice little set that's definitely unique.I did get this product for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I really like this G.G. Martinsen 32 GB Mini USB Port Slim Small Multi-lingual Selection 1.78 LCD Portable MP3 Player , Video Player , Music Player. I haven't been able to get the MP4 player to work yet but I'll figure it out. I was able to download some books from my Kindle Account to this player so I'm happy about that. Quite honestly I didn't think I'd be able to do it. One thing I like is that you get DOUBLE the amount of songs to be able to download onto this for listening. Many more then you'll ever really need as it can hold up to 10000 songs! WOW!What really confused me was the chartreuse button in the middle of the wheel. I thought when I pushed that it would SELECT what I was looking for but it did NOT do that. If I was listening to music it would increase the volume and that's basically all it does. The Menu button is your select button and the two arrows on the side are the up and down buttons. Hope this helps those that were as confused as I was figure it out.That said, for under $40 it's a great little player with good quality sound. The video is very clear which truly surprised me for a player in this price range. It's by no means as fantastic as some of the better known brands but for the money it does a great job.The only thing I haven't been able to do and doubt I will be able to do with this particular model is ""shuffle"" the songs up. There's no way I was able to see to do that. If you want that feature you may have to spend more money to be able to do that.This is a great item for the price and it would make a great gift especially for a teenager. Before spending a ton of money on one of the fancier models I'd want to be sure that my teen could keep up with something like this so this is the perfect ""test"" mp3 player.I also like the chartreuse colors.  It's like a greenish yellow/gold and this is the color they call green! But it's really more of a chartreuse color  (greenish yellow ).I also love the fact it has a voice recorder as I have a habit of parking my car and forgetting where I put it.The only drawback to this MP3/MP4 player is that the earbuds are really pretty poor. They will work in a pinch but I'd highly recommend investing in a good set of earbuds or a good quality headset because the overall quality of the player is diminished when using the ones included with the package.

"This is the perfect wine or champagne opener set for anyone with RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) or limited use in their hands. THis was very easy to use. All you do (after taking it out of the package and washing it in warm soapy water and rinsing it in clean water) is to open the arms of the wine opener (as if they're about to do some jumping jacks). Then use the handle and turn it till the screw part (also known as a worm) catches onto the cork itself. Keep going until the worm is totally or practically totally embedded into the cork itself. Now lower the ""arms"" of the wine/champagne opener and the cork will come out. I've owned a few different models but the same style as this one previously and this one is by far the most oiled machine in the bunch. It was the easiest to use.I also love that it comes with a vacuum wine stopper so that you don't lose the left over wine which is often the case. To use the vacuum wine stopper just put it into the bottle and pump it till it forms a great seal . That's it. Done.For anyone with RA, Arthritis, or limited mobility in their hands nothing gets us more frustrated when we go to use something and it doesn't work as advertised. This one works exactly as I described it would work. At least it did for me. If it doesn't do it for you either you're not doing it correctly or you might have gotten a defective one. In that case contact the seller so they can make it right for you.I did get this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is a relatively very easy selfie stick to use.It's bluetooth and the pairing was very easy and simple to do. What I like about the Amzdeal model is that it doesn't need a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo jargon figured out in order to use this selfie stick. All you do is pair it up, after charging it with the enclosed USB charging cord, and start taking pictures. It's a great selfie stick but it does lack some of the features in some of the higher end selfie bluetooth sticks such as zoom in, zoom out, and video. This is a great selfie stick for mom and dad who have never used one before to get used to especially since there's really nothing to put together. But if you're like me and do a lot of video, and pictures that you want to zoom in and out of you might be disappointed. Though for an extra selfie stick to have around just in case it's a great bargain for the money.It's also lightweight and the telescopic pole is made of aluminum making it easy to slide in and out. The button to take the pics is on the black handle at a comfortable reach which is very important whenever taking a selfie.It's also great as a gift for that teenager who is just beginning to get on social media with their pictures.It does have a nice reach when fully extended and it is made very well. I like that the part that holds the smartphone is made well and not cheap so that it won't drop my smartphone like some of the other less expensive models on the market today.This model also comes with a wrist strap that comes in handy if you don't have room in your back pocket when out on a hiking trail or are at an amusement park and want to catch friends on that ride as they splash down.I did get this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I absolutely LOVE this Calendula Foot Butter. It's like being at a spa. It makes my feet feel so smooth and refreshed. I love that it's all natural made with aloe vera , tea tree oil and oilive oil. It even had Bees Wax in it to really make your feet feel smooth as butter. I know they call it a butter and I can see why. It's a souffle that just keeps hydrating the feet. I love it. I actually use my jar in the following way:I soak my feet in a massage bath (I've got one of those electric massagers that you put water in w/ some epsom salts). I add Lavender Epsom Salts to it and let my feet soak for about 20-30 minutes on a low vibration.I then take them out of the bath and pat them dry.I then take a pair of soft socks and place them over a pot of hot water so that they get slightly damp and then place in my dryer for about 5-10 minutes till dry (This makes them nice and warm and allows the foot butter to really get into the deep crevices of my feet).Next I take a silicone brush and paint my feet lightly with this wonderful Calendula Foot Butter and then delicately place my feet into my warm socks and leave them on overnight. I do this 3-4 times per week and my feet have never looked or felt any better. I always try and make the swirls go in the same direction as the way it was in the jar when it first arrived. A tiny little bit does go a very long way with this butter.I did get this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I really love this High-Speed 1.4 Volt HDMI cable. It's male to male and gives me and my family so many new ways to setup equipment throughout the home. My son who is an avid gamer loves playing his games on my big screen tv in the den rather then on his 42 in tv in his bedroom. So this cord comes in handy with its 35 ft of flat cord he can run his gaming console from his bedroom to my big screen tv in the den, bring out his controller and he's good to go. Right now we're getting ready to upgrade the tv in the den to either a 3D tv or a 4D tv. Just haven't decided yet. In either case this will be a terrific addition for allowing us to add or subtract other devices from other rooms to our big screen tv and allow us to utilize them.

"These are a good buy when you need 2 2600mAH high capacity batteries. They're also known as 18650 batteries. I use these in my flashlight for my headlight on my bicycle and they work really well. I like that they do last about 5 hrs each on a single charge and this way I can always have a spare when I'm riding my bike on a long bike trip. This way I won't run out of light when dusk hits. Some streets are just too dangerous to be riding w/out lights on.I also love that it comes with a nice 2 battery charger. The one that came with my light kit for my bike comes with only 1 battery bay and this way I can take a few with me on overnight bike trips.One thing I like was the longer cord. My other one is a flush mount which is okay as the prongs fold down (something I wish this did ) but the fact that it has a longer cord of about 2 ft or so means I can have it on my desk right near me.

"I really love this modern 8 inch waterfall shower head. I like that it is high pressure and not lower pressure like other shower heads I've owned in the past. This way I get a nice and wonderfully relaxing rainfall shower coming down over me. Not a trickle like others I've owned in the past. I also like how all the holes where the water comes out are lined with silicone so that it comes out in unison. And besides that, I love how this is top of the line stainless steel. It's 304 Grade Stainless Steel so you know it's going to last and not rust out on you. This weighs quite a bit because it is real stainless and not plastic made to look like stainless steel.I also love that the back portion of this shower head is made to be like a mirror and is beveled on all 4 sides for an added premium touch.The pictures you'll see that I'll be posting for this review are pictures I took just prior to installing and showering with this shower head. I've had it installed now over a week and everyone loves this bathroom over my master bath as everyone loves the shower head.  This was extremely easy to install .

"I love to jump rope and I'm having fun teaching my 5 yr old grandson how to jump rope too. The only problem I had up until now was how to teach him how to jump rope using the same rope I did and not have him get hurt as it was way too long for him.Now I've got my answer. I show him how I jump rope, then I adjust the length of the rope so it fits perfectly for him. He thinks me adjusting the rope to his size is ""magic"" and a ""Game"" and I look at it as getting him off the couch and getting a bit more exercise which we all can use.To adjust it is relatively easy. You just open up the bottom of the handles and pull it thru and knot it and than put the cap back on. I turn my back on my grandson and have him say the ""magic words"" ""one to three..make it for me""And voila it's his size!So far he's learned how to do the jumping to ""one two buckle my shoe"" and he's loving it. And me teaching him gives me the added exercise I need too. So here we are Grandson and I both getting a bit of exercise.Just make sure you're both wearing good sneakers when jumping and try not to do it on an extremely hard surface.And best of all? Make sure you're both having fun.I did get this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

" 8:12 Mins This Athena KoKo Aroma Ultrasonic Diffuser is by far thee best oil diffuser I've ever owned. It is in fact BPA-Free, is EXTREMELY , EXTREMELY QUIET (I dont' even know it's on 1/2 of the time), lasts up to 6 hours of running time on a single charge, will automatically shut off when it runs out of water for a cool mist, is a cool mist (no worries about anything hot burning you, your pets or your children), and there's so much more.It is one of a few that actually have a remote control. This is especially important to me as I'm getting ready for a major surgery and when I get home from this major surgery I'll want to relax. I've already been told I'll need help getting in and out of bed so being able to turn on and off my diffuser w/ my own essential oils will be nice without having to call out for help. I will just reach into my duster pocket and turn it on or off. I can even preset the time for one hour of use, two hours of use, or even three hours of use. I can have the rotating lights rotate, stay stationary on my favorite color , or turn the lights off. I can even dim the lights or leave them bright if I choose. I can even control the how much mist comes out from this diffuser. If I had to compare this diffuser to a car I'd have to say this is by far the Rolls  Royce or Bentley of Diffusers. It does it all. I honestly don't think there's anything that this diffuser doesn't do that I'd truly want it to do except maybe to voice  commands (and who knows? that may be next on the horizon!

" 9:48 Mins This is an awesome headlight and tail light set from Sunspeed Cycling. What's really neat is how easy it is to install. NO TOOLS ARE NECESSARY TO INSTALL EITHER THE HEADLIGHT OR THE TAIL LIGHT! This is perfect for those who are like me, inept in installing anything that requires so much as a screw.The batteries which are CR 2032 batteries for the tail light are already installed and they give you a second set included with this kit at no extra cost.On top of that the headlight comes with a sleeve that will fit 3 AAA batteries which are NOT included BUT they DO give you 2 18650 Lithium Ion Batteries AND a recharger that you can use. It only takes one 18650 Lithium Ion Battery so you have an extra and if you keep it charged up won't run out. The charger is nice and slender and the plug folds in for when it's not in use which is a nice little added feature.The tail light is red and hooks right to the rear part of your seat or cargo area. To start it up all you need to do is push it in the center of the tail light (red section). The first time it will be a fast strobe light, the second push is a slower strobe light, the third push is a steady tail light (in red) and the 4th push is what turns it off!To operate the flashlight / headlight if mounted on the handlebar , You push the back side of the light that is closest to you. The first push is a strobe light , the 2nd push is off, the third push is a steady headlight (White light) and the 4th push is once again off and than it repeats the same sequence.I was quite impressed on how much light it gave off. Much more then my current set that's on my Schwinn Beach Cruiser. Where I live there aren't really any sidewalks or bike lanes so having a light for me is an absolute must have if you're going to ride a bike after dusk. I truly believe anyone who rides a bike ought to have a set of these. Just like a helmet is a must have so too should be a good quality light set and this is easy to put on, easy to adjust, is rechargeable, and if I can do it so can everyone of you. (and I also have RA in my hands..Rheumatoid Arthritis).I did get this set free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I absolutely LOVE this Venstar Bluetooth Wireless Portable Speaker. #1- It has an ultra modern design which fits well in just about any room of any home as it can mix in well with old vintage furniture or ultra modern or even an eclectic design.  I love the black color paired with the ultra modern red buttons. And the white to show what each button is for is just the icing on the cake. The top button is for the power and the next button down is for pairing the speaker to your bluetooth device it also allows you to answer a call through the speaker which is very nice to have.Then the other 2 buttons are for next or previous and I use my phone for volume controls which is fine.I love that this came with a bag for travel and it's just the perfect size for my space in my car, and also came with a nonslip mat for it to sit on, so that it won't slip. It also comes with the USB charging cord so you don't have to worry about looking for one. Everything you need is right there in this box including a very detailed and understandable owner's manual.My devices all paired up very easily and I was surprised on how well the bass sounded on a speaker this size.

Be  it winning the spelling bee, or getting an A on a math test this is just a little bit of reinforcement for the kids that will make them feel food. Designed to be like the ""Oscars"" except they have a star in the middle of the body, these are perfect for handing out at Kindergarten assemblies or if for no other reason having at birthday parties to give out to the first , second and third place winners of various games like Pin the Tail on the Donkey, Pinata, Simon Says, Relay Races , etc.They look great and are light weight and besides that, what kid doesn't like having their own little Trophy to display on their dresser or bookshelf?! They're made well and the gold doesn't flake off like some other knockoffs I've seen..I highly recommend them for anyone tossing a birthday party, a Halloween Party (First , second and third prize for best costume, scariest costume , etc,), School Assemblies etc. Even if you're holding your own ""Olympics"" or ""themed Party"" these can be used as prizes. With 18 in a package there's plenty to give out to just about everyone who deserves one!I can assure you I will be buying more for various functions as they are made well and all 18 were in perfect shape..not a broken one in the bunch.I did get this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"These are just so awesome for my dog to be able to wear her own set of goggles. She loves to wear them when I give her a bath so that the soapy water doesn't go into her eyes. she even likes to relax after the bath with her goggles on. These come in an array of colors and are just the perfect accessory for your pet. They're great when they're lying outside or on the beach to prevent sand and other dirt from getting into their eyes. My pet really loves them and even growled when I tried to remove them from her. I'm including a few pics of her after her bath when she was just relaxing on the couch . They are adjustable and while they fit my beagle-basset Lillee , they'd even fit my boarder collie Markie. These are probably too big for a chihuahua but would probably fit a dog about a terrier or bigger up to a very large dog.I also love how the goggles themselves were designed to fit a pet's face and eye shape compared to that of us humans and they fit Lillee very well!I did get these  pet goggles free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

" 5:09 Mins I am always on some sort of a diet in one way or another. But rather then restrict myself, I now eat what I want just less of it. This Imner Kitchen scale will work in grams, milligrams, ounces and pounds (LB) etc and has a nice finish. It's very modern and I love how it even has a place on the back that hyou can actually attach it to your wall via a small nail or peg or hook.That way it's always within reach and not cluttering up your counter  top.I like the modern design and I love how I can use this not only for weighing food but also for weighing small packages of up to 6 pounds.It's great for helping to aid you in your diet but it's only as good as you allow it to be. I mean you can weigh your food but then if after you weigh it you eat 3x what you weighed what good is it? But if you're like me and using it as a weight aid in conjunction of diet and exercise then this works very nicely.It runs on 2 CR 2302 batteries (They're like the flat larger watch batteries or it really reminds me of my alarm system in my home batteries) which are included so it works right out of the box.I did receive this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

" 2:46 Mins This is a great little diffuser for when you're either in the car (you're going to need to refill quite often if using it for this purpose though b/c it only works with the unit and heat no cool mist to let it get all over and into the air. That said it is good for travel when you want a bit of scent in a hotel room or for me when I head to the hospital. I like to have lavender oil to relax and this will do the job (though I will have to constantly re-add the oils to the diffuser paper). What's nice about the diffuser paper is that you can reuse it with the same oil over and over so the amount of paper you do receive should last you quite a while before needing to repurchase more.It is very easy to use..Just plug it into the unit and the USB plug into a USB outlet or laptop or another USB source. Then put one piece of Diffuser Paper onto the black top portion of the unit . Next, take your essential oil of choice and put 2-3 drops of the essential oil onto the diffuser paper and it will begin to generate a nice scent. Keep in mind because of the small size of this unit the scent will only last about 2-3 minutes.This is great for a small office cubicle or in my case when going to the hospital for surgery as an added way to relax on the hospital table next to the bed. (Think Lavender Oil).It's a good product but don't expect a ton of scent or for it to last a long time w/ only 2-3 drops of essential oils. But it is good for what it is.

"I really like the way I can now have many looks w/ only one curling iron thanks to having 5 different barrels. There are 3 clamps and 2 wrap around barrels to ensure all sorts of looks. I truly love the Clamp style barrels over the wrap around ones. There is one MAJOR flaw with this set and that is that it does NOT come with a heat proof glove. I did get burned the first time I used it. Mainly due to the fact I was so used to my previous curling irons I never thought to be careful with this one. I should've known better.I do love that it adjusts to the right voltage when traveling ..it will work on both 110 and 240 volts and you don't have to worry as when you plug it in it will automatically adjust to the proper one. This is great when you're traveling overseas to places like Japan and Europe.To me a set like this is much easier to travel with since I can pack one base and 5 tools and I don't have to worry about going over the baggage weight. The cord  is very nice and long and doesn't get tangled..another added benefit. The cord is 8 ft long which is much longer then other curling irons and other appliances that I own.I have various other products by Xtavia such as a blow dryer and a few diffusers and this definitely did NOT disappoint me with the exception of needing a heat resistant glove for styling my hair and to avoid getting burned.With this exception this is a great product to own and helps eliminate tons of corded appliances in my bathroom.I did receive this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is a very well-made leather wallet for men , though I'm inclined to actually use it for myself.  I love that it is RFID secure so that anyone with a Radio Frequency Identification scanner used for getting one's information illegally can't get mine. Its protection is built into the very nice black and white striped lining! This way anyone with one of those illegal scanners can't get your information. It's the newest technology right now for stealing one's identity. You can always look up RFID and read up on it. I won't bore you with those details here except to say that this wallet will protect you from being a target for an identity thief!I love how the outside is made from a very rich and soft leather. It has 4 credit card slots on each side of the bi-fold wallet and each slot is again lined (black and white stripe) with the RFID protection in the lining.Then behind the credit card slots on each side there is a slot to hold other items including perhaps larger bills or more credit cards or loyalty cards.In the back there are two pockets designed to hold your money. Again all the slots are lined with the RFID protection lining.Finally you have a slot that has a clear plastic front that folds up from the left side of the credit card slot to hold your identification or your driver's license and yes this too has the black and white RFID protecion in the lining.This wallet is also backed by a 100% Guarantee. If you're not 100% satisfied they'll either replace the wallet or give you a full , no hassle 100% refund! So you really have nothing to lose except not becoming a victim of identity theft.Additionally , it comes in a wonderful gift box, perfect for giving for just about any occasion.I did get this product at a discount, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I really love this selfie stick. First of all it is probably thee most functional selfie sticks that I've ever owned. And believe me, I've owned several. This one has several unique and wonderful features which I'll also discuss in this review.I love how this will work on just about any Apple smart phone or other mobile device that is on iOS 5.0 or higher and any Android mobile device that is using 4.0 or higher so it encompasses a lot of various devices that this will work with. There is a complete list included in the paperwork that is included with the selfie stick itself and there's a list of devices on the front page of this product page.I love that it goes from a short 8.8 inches long and the telescopic pole opens up all the way to 42.5 inches long. This is probably one of the longest if not thee longest selfie sticks when opened up fully that I've ever owned. Great for taking family shots or panoramic views.This selfie stick also has on the bottom of the pole where you unscrew it to charge the selfie stick via a USB port. But what's truly unique about this selfie stick is that this feature will also allow you to screw a monopod tripod to the bottom of this device so that you can actually step away from the device to check the view etc.I love the 5 button feature that's on the handle of this selfie stick.The 5 functional buttons includes take photo/zoom in/zoom out/power&change camera/video.. Most or just about all selfie sticks I've owned never had a zoom in or zoom out button or a change camera mode much less a video button. THis is awesome and gives you so many options for pictgures you probably thought you'd never be able to take on your own.It does come with a handle that you can add to the bottom and a soft velveteen case in gray so you can keep everything together. I love how it has a drawstring on it to shut it down.It seems as if Acctrend listened to everyone's concerns about selfie sticks and made one that incorporates ALL of the features anyone could ever want or need.I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is a great 5 port charger to connect to your laptop. It's fast and doesn't take up much room at all. IT can charge up to 2.5 amps per port or overall it's a bit less at 8amps according to the specs. This is enough to charge most smartphones, a tablet (iPad  or Samsung Galaxy, etc) , a set of earbuds, and a smaller bluetooth speaker. So while you're working on your laptop you can charge pretty much all of your USB devices (also think digital cameras, gopros etc) pretty much at the same time.I love how it maximizes your capability to charge multiple devices that we use regularly and does so in a timely fashion in order to keep us all well connected.I did receive the black which is very stylish and I love how the Zilu band is done along the top by the cord in a stainless steel. Just looks very professional and if you're a professional worker it not only is very functional but looks good too!It also has a built-in voltage regulator to ensure that your output produces a clean 5Volts so that your items can charge even faster.There is even an LED indicator light next to each connection so you can see if the item in that port is done charging. It's a nice finishing touch.I did get this product at a discount, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"As many of you already know I have RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) in both of my hands and chopping tends to hurt. Often I don't feel like dragging out the huge food processor when all I want to do is to chop up some veggies for a fresh salsa for myself and my grandson when he's here. It's not like I need a full huge food processor to do this. I saw this and wondered how this little device working manually would work, especially considering my RA. Well I soon found out. The day it arrived I made some salsa. I put a few scallions, a bit of garlic, some tomatoes, and 1/2 onion and a few jalapeno peppers and then we pulled the cord several times and it made a very nice salsa. I didn't expect it to do such a good job to be quite honest. But it did. Pulling the cord was nice, smooth and easy;  especially for one w/ difficulty using her hands. I also like how fast it was to cleanup and we actually used the bowl to serve the salsa in , just removing the blades. When we were done we still had a bit left over so we put the top on (again leaving the blades off) and placed it in the fridge.I cleaned the unit prior to use and it has 3 razor sharp blades inside it that as you pull the cord it slices and dices right through those veggies.When it comes to harder veggies I haven't tried it yet (like carrots) but I don't see why that wouldn't work as well.I did get this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is a very nice quality for a money belt. I prefer to keep mine under my shirt but this one has a rough belt so I would need to wear it over my t-shirt. Not something I like doing. It does extend out to 48 inches but I would certainly measure your waist if you think you might be nearing that size just to be sure.I like that it's RFID secure so that identity thieves can't get my person information by scanning me as I walk by. I also would put my credit cards and driver's license in those RFID pockets as a secondary precaution as I don't see the RFID lining like I do in some wallets that I own, so to be safe (one can never be too safe when protecting one's identity) I recommend using this in conjunction with those RFID envelopes.I like the fact that this money belt has two pockets. The back pocket is large enough to hold my daughter's iPhone 6S and I tried it out on my iPhone 6 and both fit nicely not even snug. In the back pockets along the back wall of this money belt there are 2 pockets ..perfect for housing a few keys or your debit card in one and a key or two in the other..or even a set of earbuds.The front pocket is great for housing your mad money.I did get this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I actually bought these shoes as house slippers to wear around my home and to let the dogs out of the house. But after receiving them and trying them on I decided to wear them as shoes both in the car and around town. They're that comfortable. The only thing I will say (and I'm glad I did this ) , was since they only come in whole sizes , you're best to buy 1 size up if you're into a 1/2 size. EX: I wear a size 8 1/2 but I bought a size 9. It truly fit me perfectly. They're extremely comfortable and I like how the bottoms are rubberized so I won't slip and fall when I rush around town. The tops have that matted bamboo plastic material but the way it's made it is extremely comfortable.The gingham fabric in both red and white and blue and white is a lot of fun, but I wouldn't wear them near a chlorine pool or on the beach. It's made more or less to wear around the house, out to take out the garbage or bring in the mail or newspaper while wearing a  housecoat.I sometimes even forget that I've got them on and will kick back in the recliner still wearing them.A definite great purchase and it was at a very reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EK0ZEC0HHJHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LK1XMSU#wasThisHelpful","R3EK0ZEC0HHJHN","A3984G9B5FXH64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3984G9B5FXH64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love the way these Sport Wireless Earbuds fit. I like that I was able to take them to the gym and work up a sweat and it didn't cut out on me with my bluetooth iPhone 6 . I really love the quality of the sound and how the bass was better then most other sweatproof wireless earbuds I've used and tested previously. It was very easy to pair my iPhone 6 to this set of earbuds and it was done in only a matter of a few minutes and it truly was flawless. I like how it did have a stereo quality to them and it almost sounded like high definition.The fact that this came with 3 sets of ear buds and 3 sets of ear fins to help customize the perfect fit was great though my fit was actually the set that they came with. I recommend trying out various sets before you settle, as the right set might not be the first one you try. I tried a few but came back to the first set!The fact that the band itself is sweatproof makes it great for working out in the gym or out in the yard , and I don't have to worry about it cutting out on me.This does allow for hands free calling whereas some stereo ear buds do not have this feature. It's nice to be able a call and not have to touch the phone when I'm in the gym and all sweaty.This does come with the usb charger plug so anywhere you have a usb plug in you can charge the phone and I love the pouch it comes in. The mesh bag is fun and holds everything in place.This will work on most Android or Window phones as well as iPhones, iTouch, and iPod and Ipads , as well as most other bluetooth tablets.I like that you can also adjust the phone call volume while on the call with this set of earbuds.This is a wonderful set and I'd highly recommend it to any music lover or anyone who has a need for a wireless set of earbuds for hands-free talking on their smartphone.This does come with a small booklet for directions but honestly you probably won't need it.I did get this set of earbuds free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is a great father/son project that my grandson Vincent does on a regular basis with his dad, my son in law Jacob. He loves the fact that not only can he build these animals but that it has a remote control on the back of it so that it can go. Something that is an advantage over other building kits.My grandson and I did do a wonderful original video when we first received this but my camcorder pooted out and as a result I had to rush over to my grandson Vincent's home to have him do a review with me via video. It is a bit rushed and I apologize for that but he wanted to do it and do it now and it does take a while. When I uploaded it to this product it didn't come out right so I'm doing this as written w/ some pictures that I've taken yesterday as well.  He loves this set and it comes with everything you need including the remote to make it go. The remote does take 4 AAA batteries and I highly recommend getting a good rechargeable battery set with a charger as when I got to his home he didn't have any battery power left (he wore it out and that was the 3rd set of AAA batteries he ran out on. And it only took him about 3 weeks to run out of battery power 3 times. He is constantly doing these rebuilds with his daddy and playing with these building block robots. I love how it makes him think and is hand and eye based so he is learning and doing at the same time.He loves the fact that the blocks are very colorful and easy to put together and that he and his dad, my son-in-law Jacob can do this together. It's their father-son time and I like it is a lot more educational then those horrible violent video games that they both like to play.He's already told me for Christmas he wants at least one of the other sets for his daddy and him to put together. I'm so excited that he doesn't want video games I'll probably buy 2 of these other sets.He might be 5 yrs old but he is extremely bright and with the help of his dad who loves to build things the two of them have these things built in no time.I do apologize that I had to remove the video but I hope that these pictures will suffice.I truly love how this set comes with everything you need minus the 4 AAA batteries to make all the robotic animals pictured on the back. According to my grandson his favorite one that he and his dad put together was the dog as they let it run around chasing Harley. Harley is Vincent's Beagle.Vincent' told me the Crocodile came ina  close second.I did get this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I really love this wonderful tie bar. But I did NOT get it to hold a tie to my shirt. Rather I got this to hold two ends of a scarf together. Now I can create all sorts of wonderful looks with my scarves and hold them together without the use of a safety pin. I just slip the two ends together and put them under the clip and they hold beatifully. And nobody but myself is ever the wiser. I also love how this tie bar is packaged. It's packaged in a wonderful By Nelson gift box that slides out and then opens almost like a treasure chest except the top comes completely off. And there underneath the top is the tie bar secured where it can just slide off of its mounting.It's beautifully done.

"I love all the bobuCuisine products I've purchased. They are always extremely well made and never disappoint and this is certainly no exception to the rule.  I love how this is one piece and I don't have to worry about scooping out icecream only to have the part that scoops break off while I'm in the middle of scooping out ice cream for all the kids. This picks up through ice cream, gellato , even buckets of sherbert and Italian Ice without any issues. It doesn't even bend and is very comfortable in my hand. Having RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) makes it very difficult with a lot of utensils to be able to scoop things without a problem. This is definitely NOT the case with the bobuCuisine One-piece Ice Cream Super Scoop! It goes in smoothly and doesn't bend and makes it a pleasure to take out. It's very well- balanced too. And I just love the black rubberized grip and the stainless steel design. It's modern but more important then that it is extremely functional!Being it is one piece it is easier to clean and can also be placed into the dishwasher though I prefer to do my dishes by hand.I was given a discount on this bobuCuisine One-Piece Ice Cream  Super Scoop in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I love my bobuCuisine's Juice Boost Infusion Pitcher. I'm always on the run grabbing an infusion cup and going but when I'm at home I like to have the glass infusion pitcher so I can make a bit more fruit water without having to keep on refilling it. This holds 33 oz of water plus a lot more fruit then any infusion water bottle I've come across. I like having it in the firdge so I can pull it out whenever I want a nice refreshing drink. It has totally replaced my diet soda habit and I am now on  a strawberry lemon with stevia for homemade lemonade w/ strawberry kick. That and I also love making a citrus drink w/ lemons, limes, and tangerines.Whenever I have company I take it out of the fridge to serve a nice healthy drink and everyone is amazed at how terrific it looks and how healthy an item it is.

"I have tried several bunion regulators and splints but nothing worked quite like this. I thought I had bunions on the side of my small toe on my left foot but it turned out it was a massive callus. It hurt super bad so my doctor recommended that I try a splint for overnight. Most didn't work well and it would only irritate the callus. I did soak my feet and use a callus remover but this was in the interim for overnight till it would disappear. I then stumbled across the Dr Frederick's Original Nighttime Bunion Splints and it comes two in a package so you have one for each foot. They were very comfortable and allowed me to roll over onto my side w/out my feet hurting like they did in the past. I must say I got my first good night's sleep in over 2 1 /2 weeks. I'm sure they will work on bunions too though what I thought was a bunion turned out not to be and was a callus which is much easier to treat. It did work on this as well and I'm highly pleased. I put this up should a callus come about again or should I have another need for this if I should ever get a bunion which is also quite painful.These are made of a very lightweight material and have velcro closures so they're extremely easy to put on and take off.I did get these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

" 4:02 Mins I really like this Detox Tea by Young Leaf Natural Wellness. It is all organic and it smells wonderful , tastes wonderful and is easy to prepare. It's a loose tea that has Organic Green Tea, Organic Lemon Myrtle, Organic Linden Blossoms, Organic Holy Basil (Tusli) , Organic Spearmint, Organic Rose Hips, and Organic Ginger Root.As you can see from the list of ingredients EVERYTHING in this loose tea is totally organic!It also has a wonderful scent. The smells that dominate this tea are the Spearmint and the Lemon w/ a hint of the Holy Basil. And this tea is extremely easy to prepare. Just take 1 Tablespoon of the loose tea and put it inside of your tea infuser or if you have a reusable tea bag that will work too. Next boil some water and pour over the infuser or tea bag. Let seep for 5-7 minutes and that's it. If you want to add some sweetness some honey or stevia is recommended (though I personally did not use any added sweetener).This tea is made to cleanse the body of toxins and is a great jump start to any diet.It is made to do for 14 days and you have 1 cup of tea per day. I like that it didn't keep me in the bathroom like some other detox teas and drinks that I've had in the past.By the 3rd or 4th day I did notice a huge increase in energy which was a nice surprise. I know the package stated ""Increases Energy"" but I didn't give it much weight and figured I might see a little bit of added energy. What I experienced was a nice amount of noticeable increased energy but not so much that I felt like I was on overdrive. It was a nice amount of added energy that allowed me to do a workout at a good clip w/out over exerting myself.I really love this tea and I love how I was able to lose 5 lbs in the 14 days. And I'm on track with my diet. It really did help jumpstart my diet for me.Since everyone's body is different your results may be different then mine. You may lose a lot more weight or less weight.I actually looked forward to my detox tea at 10am each morning.I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I have bursitis of the knee on my left knee as well as arthritis and sometimes my knee just goes out from under me. I've got an entire host of problems with my left knee and it seems most compression sleeves only work for a little while but not for the entire day. I decided to try this Knee brace to see if it would support me for the entire day. I really have tried several types of braces and figured it was something I'd have to ""just deal with"" until I could get surgery on it but no more. This really works quite well. It's made of Neoprene which is quite sturdy and has not one, not two but 3 velcro straps to keep it in place. It really helps relieve stress on my knee and by having the 3 thick (these aren't flimsy in the least) velcro straps it doesn't slip down on me like compression sleeves or other types of cloth or other material types of knee braces. I like that there are 2 longer straps on the top  and bottom of this brace and a middle strap that goes behind the knee and up to the part where my knee shows through. I like that the knee shows through as it allows movement and my knee will NOT lock up like on other kinds of knee braces.The back is very well stitched.It's good for anyone who like me has bursitis of the knee, arthritis in the knee. has an injury or a trick knee. It's good for those who also play sports and want to protect the knee or people who are on their feet a lot and complain of knee pain.I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"My grandson as most kids his age (he's 5 yrs old) is into water sports and toys. And he loves squirt toys. My daughter and son-in-law have access to a water slide from a neighbor that my grandson loves to play with.When I unpacked these my grandson immediately (he was over while his father put together for me a rug shampooer) gravitated towards these squirt toys. So I let him go outside with a pail of water and play. He had a lot of fun. There are tons of kids in the immediate cul de sac where he lives so these 20 miniature plastic water squirt toys were a great thing to send him home with. This way they can have water fun in the sun at home.These are great for birthday parties , pool parties, and just about any occasion here in NE FL as it's pretty warm thru Mid December and then warms back up by the middle to the end of February. These will most definitely get a ton of use out of themA few of the tips did come off in shipping , this was no big deal and I twisted them back on. If you're worried about little ones I'd suggest gluing them in place or twisting them very tightly so they don't come off.

"This is a wonderful pirates hat. It fit me perfectly but my grandson Vincent's other grandparents built him a Pirate Treehouse and he basically claimed it for himself. My grandson Vincent ,who is 5 years old, told me ""Nana Sunni , that hat looks UGLY on you. It would look better on me"" so I let him try it on and it does so I let him have it. He promised to take good care of it. He does tend to take really good care of his play toys and other items so I wasn't  worried that he wouldn't take care of this too.It's made of a good quality felt that won't flake off very easily and the mold is wonderful and very well made.It's a great addition to a hat collection or for wearing it during play or Halloween.I did get this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I actually LOVE how soft this pillow is. It's a toddler size pillow which means it's much smaller then your standard size pillow. It is 13 inches tall by 18 inches across . It's made of organic cotton which is super soft. For those of you like myself that has a lot of allergies this is the pillow for you as it is hypoallergenic. Perfect for those suffering from allergies.I also love that this pillow is machine washable. I'd wash it in warm water with a cool rinse and then put it on either air dry or low heat in the dryer or would hang it outside to dry on a nice warm day.It is made in the USA which is nice to see as most textiles these days are made overseas. I do love to support wherever possible purchases made here at home.This pillow is perfect for toddlers but that is NOT the only use I've found for this pillow. It's perfect for car trips when one wants to sleep as it fits right against the headrest of the car perfectly. It's also a perfect pillow for putting in a carryon bag or totebag that you can put under the seat of a plane and then take out when you wish to relax. I don't know about you , but I will NOT get a pillow on a plane as I never know if it's been sanitized or not and I don't want to take a chance. Now I don't have to. I just take my comfy toddler pillow with my own pillow case with me (I found a few online or you can use a standard case fold it over once the pillow is in it and use safety pins to hold it in place. Another thing is to take an old pillow case and cut it down and stitch it into place so you can remove and wash it after each use).I did receive this toddler pillow at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is a great fly swatter. It is much wider then other fly swatters I've had and it is much more flexable. I like that it comes in a two pack and comes with a lifetime warranty so you don't have to worry about protecting your purchase. Here in NE FL not only are mosquitoes a problem but so are flies and what we call  ""love bugs"". This fly swatter was able to get all 3 in one fell swoop. My son in law tested them out and was even able to get a few spiders on the wall and it was fast and easy. It even kept the bugs on the swatter so all I had to do was take it to the trash and bang the edge in it and they fell out.My son in law loved it so much he ended up taking them with him. So..guess who now has to buy another package? Yup...Me! Here is the picture with my son-in-law Jacob showing off how he has BOTH of what I thought was my brand new fly swatters. On second thought. I think  I'll have him buy me a new package on his Amazon.com account!  :)The handle is also a lot stronger then most. My son-in-law has broken several fly swatters in recent months. Sometimes my son in law doesn't know his own strength, which is how the handle gets broken. Try as he might (and he swatted quite a bit to test this out) he did NOT break either handle. For this reason alone I'm giving it a full 5 star review. This is much sturdier then dollar store fly swatters. I figure  if he had to replace a swatter once per month (and it's usually a few times more then that during the summer) he'd spend at least $20 in two years. For about 1/2 you can get 2 lifetime fly swatters in your choice of color. I got the green ones as it was nice and bright. The color green is like a Crayola Crayon Regular Color Green.I did get this package of 2 fly swatters free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I absolutely LOVE these Aqtivaqua Junior Swimming Glasses. I got the Aqua with Yellow for my 5 yr old grandson but out of curiosity since I have a problem finding goggles that fit my small head decided to try them on. Well they fit! I then put on some steaming hot water in my shower to see if they would stay ""Anti Fog"" as advertised and surprisingly they did. (I honestly didn't think they would). I like that they have UV protection too.I'm sure with adjusting they will fit my 5 yr old grandson who goes swimming every weekend at his other grandparent's home and I'm sure he can't wait to put them on. It's very easy to adjust the split strap that's in the back. To fit me I didn't have to adjust this at all. But for my 5 yr old grandson he might need to have it adjusted to fit his tiny head (his is a bit smaller then mine).If you have a hard time finding goggles that fit you because they run to big, I'd suggest giving these a try. I didn't think they would fit me but they do.I also love that they actually come with instructions on how to adjust the split strap and it goes over all the features.One thing it did say on the back of this paper was to NOT spit on your finger and then rub the lense as this can damage the anti-fog protection that was added to the lense. I had no idea. Figured I'd pass this along in case you don't read the paper.Also it says to just rinse in fresh water and  not to use harmful detergents or chemicals on these goggles.And finally to keep avoid heat and to keep it out of ""direct exposure to sunlight"" .I love the case it comes in and is a good way to keep it stored when not in use.I did receive these goggles at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"There are so many uses for peppermint oil. I've been using it for quite a while and I absolutely love it and can't seem to keep enough of it on hand.Here's a fraction of the uses that I've used Peppermint Oil for:#1- I use it to help with headaches and migraines. I suffer terribly from migraines and so there are so many ways to use this to help. Depending how debilitating they are. If minor I'll put about 8 drops of peppermint oil and about 3 drops of lavender oil into my cool mist humidifier and lie down to relax. If they're bad but not too bad that I don't feel blinded or the need for a dark room and I can stand up I'll boil a pot of water over the stove and let it sit so it's no longer boiling but hot and add about 10 drops per medium pot and put a towel over my head and breathe slowly in and out. (This also works for congestion or a really bad cold).. If it's really super bad and I need to lie down in silence in a completely quiet and dark room I'll put about a splash of Peppermint Oil on a dry washcloth and put it onto my forehead. The scent will travel to the nose as its very potent and it helps relieve it by seeping into my skin on my forehead too.#2- I love to use it in a spray bottle with water. About 10-15 drops only. I spray this along the window bases and the baseboards of my home. This keeps mice and spiders away. (In fact sometimes I'll go outside my home and spray the plants with it (very lightly) and it won't hurt the plants and I've kept spiders away too. Living in the suburbs on over 1 acre of property w/ over 200 ft of woods that I own behind my home and backyard tends to bring in mice this helps keep them totally at bay. Mice do NOT like the scent of peppermint (I've done my research some say it doesn't work but I've yet to have another mouse enter my house since using this method so I truly believe it works. I have had one mouse in over 14 yrs of living in my home. It entered after Jimmy past away .. I was getting ready to leave my home for a friend's in home party when I picked up a sealed bag of chips-Jimmy's favorite- and some fell out of the bottom. Looked and saw where a mouse nibbled the bottom to get into it. Funny since I never had a mouse enter my home till after Jimmy past away...Well I freaked out and grabbed my laptop. It said to try this so I did. No mice since. I have since named that mouse Jimmy).#3- Congestion and Colds...use about 10 drops per medium pot of hot water. Take a pot of water and boil it. Let it steep till it's no longer boiling but still extremely hot. Then add 10 drops of Peppermint Oil to the water and stir. Grab a towel  and start breathing in slowly. This well help any congestion and colds break up mucus.#4- To relax in bed and help go to sleep mix 5-6 drops of Peppermint Oil with 3-4 drops of Lavender oil in a cool mist humidifier.#5-  To help rejuvenate  you just do about 8 drops in a cool mist humidifier.#6- Great Makeup Remover .. Add 3-4 drops onto a piece of gauze or cotton ball and remove makeup. No more scrubbing or adding chemicals to your face. (works great with Lavender Oil too).#7- It's also great for the face and scalp. Prior to washing your hair use a spray water bottle mixed with 10 drops of peppermint oil and water. Shake well and mix and put on scalp. Will help with dandruff. For the face helps with acne.  And it feels wonderful. I put some in the fridge for about 5 minutes prior to using to get that ""wakeup now "" feeling.There are many more uses that you can use Peppermint Oil for. If you just Google ""Peppermint Oil"" you'll get tons of articles on it and all of it's many many uses!ArtNaturals is 100% Pure and Organic with no added fragrances , colors or preservatives and is made here in the USA so you can feel good about the quality of this product. I love that ArtsNaturals keeps all of their Therapeutic Grade Oils in dark bottles so it won't degrade during shipping or while in your home and that they include a GLASS Dropper instead of a cheap plastic one. The plastic ones are okay but you can't wash them and use them in another bottle as they tend to maintain the scent and odor of the previous oils. The glass ones you can wash thoroughly and they will NOT keep scents so you're not mixing them when you do not want to mix.I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is a complete bundle for keeping both your finger nails and toe nails totally manicured. You get both a toe nail clipper and a finger nail clipper. And to top that off you also get a very nice emery board for filing them down perfectly. You also get a nice case to keep everything inside.I love the fact that the clippers are made of a very high quality stainless steel. This way they won't rust even if they accidentally get wet. They also should last a long time. The blades are not only stainless steel but are precision blades so this way they will cut where placed with very minimum effort. This gives a cleaner and more precise cut that will be easier to smooth out with the emery board.The joints on the clippers are made to last and aren't low quality which makes this set well worth it.One thing I didn't know that I found out about by reading the back of the box was that by cutting straight across you have less risk of an ingrown nail.You can tell that this company stands behind this set as it offers a LIFETIME GUARANTEE. They stand behind the performance of their products and you can always find out more by going to their website.I'm very pleased with the clippers and have used them on both my toenails and fingernails and it did a wonderful job.

"I absolutely LOVE this set. The bracelet I received has 4 charms on it. Dream, Believe, Love and the Infinity Symbol. And I love the earth tones that they're done in. The watch has matching  earth tones that make them look great either together or apart.I even got a wonderful scroll inside the little linen pouch that held it altogether. And what was unique was that the scroll was held together with a tiny feather ring. I tried it on just for giggles but it fit my pinky finger so it makes a wonderful pinky ring (I wear a size 3-4 on my pinky).The watch band for the watch is made of leather and one strand of the multi faceted band has beds and a feather charm dangling from it.Since I am now battling Breast Cancer the charms of Dream, Believe, Love and Infinity Symbol take on a whole new meaning for me and one I'm going to be wearing as a badge of courage. Though you might just wear yours for enjoyment or because it looks good on your or because you like the wonderful earth tones it comes in.The cute linen pouch is awesome to keep these pieces in and I especially love the scroll that the Belle company put together making you feel extra special and morethen just a number to this company.I did receive this set at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I got this toy for my niece Kali who is 8 months old. I know it said 18 months and older but figured her grandmother and dad who are raising her could help her with it. Turned out Kali didn't need any help at all.I did install the 2 AA batteries that did NOT come with this unit. It did require that I take a small screwdriver to the battery case to be able to remove the battery back housing to be able to put in the batteries and thankfully I did have a small tiny screwdriver set in which to remove the back and put in 2 AA batteries for Kali.Kali is a preemie born at 33 weeks which is why she appears to be so tiny (and she is). But boy did she absolutely LOVE the Guitar.The top button was her favorite (and mine as it wasn't so ear piercing). The top button plays the scales.The middle button plays some songs as does the bottom button. I didTHe blue section lights up to the music which was what Kali liked best.I was going to make a video of her playing with it but every time I took out the video she screamed bloody murder. I was then going to borrow it to make the video but Kali would NOT give it back. Guess that says how much a little one will like this, as they won't give it up.She did allow me to take 1 picture of her holding it and it will be added along w/ a few other pictures to this review.(If you don't see the pictures right away don't fret..sometimes Amazon will take 1-2 days to post the pictures..keep coming back..Kali is a cutie).I did get this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"Chakra comes from Sanskrit meaning Wheel and there are basically 7 wheels or energies in our body. When one of our ""Wheels"" isn't well this can often lead to illness. Another way to look at it instead of a ""Wheel"" is an ""energy center"".. If the energy center in our body isn't working to its fullest potential this can lead to us getting ill.The first Chakra is the Root Chakra and it starts at the base of our spine or tailbone. It is the representation of us being grounded and is our foundation. It is the Red Jasper in the set.The Second Chakra is the Sacral Chakra and is located Lower abdomen, about 2 inches below the navel and 2 inches in. The second Chakra gives us a  connection and the  ability to accept others and new experiences. It also has to do with one's feeling of sexuality. This is represented by the Orange Carnelian stone in this Chakra Set.The Third Chakra is the Solar Plexus Chakra and is located Upper abdomen in the stomach area. It is thought to give us our sense of Self-worth, self-confidence, self-esteem. It is represented by the Yellow Jade.The Fourth Chakra is the Heart Chakra or our Ability to love. It is located by the center of chest just above heart.The Green Adventurine stone is what represents the 4th Chakra.The Fifth Chakra is the Throat Chakra and effects our ability to talk or communicate. It is located on the throat. It effects not only communication but also the ability of self-expression and the truth. It is represented by the Blue stone called a Lapis Lazuli.The Sixth Chakra is known as the Third Eye Chakra and if effects us being able to read into things and see the big picture. It is located on the forehead between the eyes and is also known as the Brow Chakra. It also effects things like our imagination, our intuition, our wisdom and the ability to be able to think and make rational decisions. It is represented by the Amethyst or purple crystal.The Seventh Chakra is known as the Crown Chakra and is at the very top of the head. It represents the ability to be fully connected spiritually. If we're not connected Spiritually then we might be off balance and then can get ill. We need to align our mental and spiritual state so that we can bring our physical and mental being together for a full healing. The 7th and final Chakra also represents pure bliss.There are many books and articles on the 7 Chakras and how to heal one's soul and in turn heal one's physical being.If you feel at any time something is out of alignment your can use these Chakra stones as a healing tool to meditate and get right with that part of the spirit that controls it.It's one more aid to keep well and it goes back thousands of years.It's a very interesting study and I intend to study more of it.These stones are very well polished and are very convenient to be able to carry with you. When I go to the hospital I intend to carry my Chakra Stones with me and meditate prior to my surgery. Getting my mind right will help.The quality of these engraved stones is very good compared to others I've seen.I even like the little very soft linen pouch it came in,  in order to keep them safe.I did get this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"This is a must have for any camper or traveler who drives a car out there. It truly has just about every emergency device you can need in one tool. It has a flashlight that doubles as a strobe light. It works on 3 AAA batteries NOT included. Just twist off the top of the flashlight part of this emergency automotive tool and the holder for the 3 AAA batteries comes out. Place your 3 AAA Batteries inside and put the top back on and just press the black button on the base of the tool and the first thing that will come on is the strobe light. Great for emergencies so others can locate you. Then press again and it's a regular flashlight. At the base you have more tools like a small pocket knife, file, small scissors, bottle/can opener and more. And there's even a built in seat belt cutter and a windshield break out tool on the other side of the base where the tools are located. Just go and press the red button on the silver part of the base to release it.Like i stated great for anyone who breaks down in an emergency or a camper, fisherman or hunter alike. And it's so compact it will easily fit right into the backpack, tackle box, hunters vest or front pocket of your pants.I did get this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I really like this body butter a lot! What I like is that #1 it is NOT heavily scented! It IS very lightly scented with a fresh and inviting scent. They call it a light floral scent and I would have to agree with that. Most body butters I've used in the past have been a tad on the greasy side so I was nicely surprised that this was not at all greasy. It's a bit thicker then a lotion which is why it's called a body butter. I followed the directions and used it after my shower but instead of once per day , I used it after each shower and so I used it twice per day ( I take 2 showers a day sometimes 3 if I hit the gym).  I like that it was absorbed into my skin rather quickly and didn't hold a lot of residue or that it didn't take a long time to absorb. The scent lasted a good long while and didn't interfere with my regular scent that I wear (I wear Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue) and it actually rather enhanced the scent ).The color isn't white but a rather it  has a nice light blue/green tint which might have something to do with the avocado, mango , shea and aloe vera that's in this wonderful whipped body butter. It's almost like a souffle.I have noticed that some of my dry patches, in particular my elbows have become less dry compared to prior to use and my skin is beginning to look a bit more youthful.I did receive this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I love chalk markers. There are so many uses. I love to use them on chalk marker labels to label mason jars with things like cookie mix and put dry ingredients in them with a recipe card and a small wooden utensil .. Makes a wonderful homemade gift.I also love to let my Grandson go to town at the holidays drawing on my glass windows and sliding glass doors to create his :""masterpieces"" and then we have fun taking a sponge and warm soapy water and washing it off afterwards.I like to make a chalkboard with chalkboard stickers and then let him draw on that too at the table and learn how to spell simple words like cat , dog, mom and dad. Not only does he learn how to spell but he has a good time and it's a lot of fun for him and he doesn't realize he's getting an education out of it too! What a combination of education and fun!There are 10 colors in this set and it's a great size for small hands to hold.To being you need to relieve the pressure in the tip by holding it up straight and pushing the tip down gently.Then you need to shake the chalk marker for several seconds with the cover on it so it doesn't come out all over the place. After several seconds what you do next is to hold the marker and press the tip down so that the color flows through the tip and colors it w/ colored chalk.Now you're ready to begin. You need to do this for each color.Before each use it is recommended to shake the marker with the cap on for several seconds, and then gently pumping it against the paper or whatever surface you're going to be working on .It is recommended that each marker be stored horizontially when not in use.The colors are very vibrant compared to other chalk markers I've used in the past and I'm very happy with the results.I did get this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I really have noticed a tremendous difference since I began using the Elizabeth Parker Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner. When I first began using it my hair was truly as flat as a very thin pancake. Now I'm starting to see it come around and I have a bit of volume though not as much as I would've hoped for. Then again, I do realize these things take time. The fact that I'm starting to see a huge difference in such a short time gives me hope that I might one day soon have a ton of volume to my hair.One thing I've noticed is that it's sulfate free. Sulfates basically Bothweigh your hair down, preventing growth and volume. Since this is sulfate free and I don't have anything to weigh my hair down that in and of itself was enough to add a bit of volume right away to my hair.Both the shampoo and deep conditioning mask are all natural ,  organic , and I like that it's fragrance free.Since I color my hair I especially like that it is safe for color-treated hair such as my own.I've noticed some added body as well as strength and I'm noticing my hair is starting to grow at a bit faster rate. This was something I didn't even expect which is a nice added surprise. I will continue to use this product and will report in about a month on how it is now doing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EK0YLIU1TC04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WA8QP68#wasThisHelpful","R3EK0YLIU1TC04","A3984G9B5FXH64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3984G9B5FXH64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This wallet is  wonderful. Not only does it look premium , it also has the RFID factor so that nobody can steal any credit card or personal information. The entire inside is lined with RFID blocking material and the outside is made of genuine black leather and then add to that the RFID blocking material to keep your credit card and license and personal information from getting into the hands of thieves and you've got a winner in this bi-fold wallet. I love how they thought of everything for gift giving too. It comes in a wonderful gift box and when you open that there's a nice felt pouch. When you take the bi-fold wallet out of the pouch you can smell the scent of pure leather and see the quality RFID blocking matterial anywhere the credit cards, money or license may be. This was very well thought out and it is truly a premium item. My son and son-in-law will each be getting one of these for Christmas, since they both travel and my son-in-law is a trucker so he can easily be targeted. But NOT if he has this wallet on him. Just one way we can be proactive in keeping Identity Thieves at bay.This premium RFID wallet besides being lined has a separate fold down compartment for your id or driver's license, and 6 slots each RFID lined for credit cards or debit cards and has 2 billfold slots for money and each slot is separately lined with RFID material so that no ID thief will be able to use one of those radio refrequency machines to steal your information or identification.I also love that this product comes with a lifetime warranty.

"I really like this belt for walking around without having to hold onto a purse all day long at an amusement park. The only drawback is that my daughter's iPhone 6S barely fit. It fit but was  a bit difficult to zip closed. I finally managed to get it to close and again it was also a bit difficult to open up. I do love the color of the hopt pink and the band is wider then most making it much more comfortable then other bands . But if there was one thing I would improve upon would be to make one pocket a bit deeper so that an iPhone 6S would fit inside comfortably.My old  Samsung Galaxy 3 fit w/out the case I had on it and my 6 barely fit at all.It's good for an older or smaller smartphone but not the larger ones, especially if you're going to have a case on them (in particular the Otter box type of case) or a wallet case).I like that it has 2 pockets so I can put money and keys on one side along with my driver's license and a phone (although be it a smaller smart phone) on the other.The way it clips is very secure and it fits larger people such as myself without much of an issue as you can tell by the photos I've uploaded to this review.I do like the waterproof neoprene material that this is made of and the belt is a nice stretchy elastic. It goes for about  a 45 in waist tops so if you have a much bigger waist please measure before purchasing.I do love the pink color and it's great for working out at the gym, taking walks around town and traveling.Anywhere a fanny pack would go this can go too and it's much lighter weight which is great especially in those hot summer months when nobody wants to lug a leather fanny pack around their waist.I did get this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

" 2:47 Mins I've owned many manual knife sharpeners over the years and most you need to exert a lot of force on them in order to get your knives nice and sharp. That is not the case with this electric knife sharpener by Linkyo. This electric knife sharpener is very easy to use. You just plug it into a 2 prong outlet and turn it on by switching the red button located in the front center of the sharpening unit. Next do a few passes through the device using zero pressure on the unit on each slot of slot 1 and again on slot 2 (both slots are clearly marked for your convenience). That's it. Done. It's fast, easy and I like how the slots are thin so that you can't accidentally catch your finger in them.Another thing to keep in mind..this is only good for straight edge knives. If you have a serrated edge knife you cannot use this sharpener with one exception. If your knife has one side that is serrated and one side of the knife is straight edge you can in fact use the #2 pass through only.This is a great way to extend the life of your knives even if they aren't that expensive. It really makes having this device totally worth while.I recommend you watching my video that goes along with this review to see the demonstration and to see how well this device will sharpen your knives too.I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I love Mikee Sriracha All Natural Hot Chili Sauce. I love that it has a nice amount of heat compared to other similar Sriracha Sauces. It is made with Red Jalapeno Peppers which are much hotter then their green counterparts.There are so many ways to use this Sriracha All Natural Hot Chili Sauce. I love to add it to my chile and put it over some nice brown steamed rice. Chili con carne hot version ! Tastes Delicious.I also love to make scrambled eggs and add it to my scrambled eggs or if I'm making a Mexican Omlet Which contains the following: Chopped Scallions, A bit of pressed garlic, some chopped green jalapenos, some chopped mushrooms, some medium to hot salsa and some shredded mexican cheese , After I fold the omlet I'll add a few drips down the top of it and spread it out to add the Umph it needs to bring out the heat.I also use it on my Mexican Burgers.. and If I steam veggies I've been known to add a few drops to my steamed broccoli and cauliflower and carrots along w/ some melted butter for flavor.And I always use it in my Spanish or Mexican Rice for flavor.It does have a lot of a kick so you don't want to add too much , unless you can tolerate a lot of heat.I also love that they give you two bottles of Mikee Sriracha Chili Sauce as we use it on just about everything and  I've already gone through an entire bottle of this wonderful Sriracha Sauce.I did get this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I love this classic game of Jacks. It brings home so many childhood memories from playing with my friends at school to summer camp in the cabins on the floor when it was too stormy to go outside.It's very easy to play too. The way I played as a child , and that I taught my grandson Vincent to play is that you shook all the jacks in your hands (the metal stars) and tossed them onto the floor so that they were spread out. You tossed the jack ball up into the air so it bounced once and you grabbed your first jack. (that was onesies) ..then you picked them all up and tossed the jacks again and went for twosies. etc till you completed it at twelvesies. If your jack ball bounced more then once then you were out and it moved to the next player. The person with the most turns at the end of play or the first person to do twelvesies won the game! My grandson loves this and to me it's a lot better then him sitting in front of a TV set playing video games all day long. He thinks it's a lot of fun. And it's something we do together on the floor in my den (You do need a hard surface to play on).I like that this set comes with 2 balls in case one gets lost and a little pouch to store it all into.It brings a classic game back to life once again and now another generation can have a lot of fun.This company also gives you an ebook (look for it in your email after ordering ) with alternative ways to play this game that are just as fun.I did get this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I absolutely LOVE this cold pressed ALL NATURAL Aloe Vera Gel. First off we all know it's great on dry skin and sunburns. It is also great if you get a bit of poison ivy or poison oak. It also takes the sting out of most bee stings (but if it starts looking red and irritated I always recommend going to the hospital or doctor's office just in case).What I also love about this company is that the Aloe Vera Plants are grown and this product is produced right here in the USA. ArtNaturals makes superior products and they always seem to work just as described and this was no exception.You can also use Aloe Vera Gel for razor burn (especially in those bikini areas) and heat rashes too. I also like to put some in my hair to soften it up. It also helps with dry areas on my face.While I do have aloe vera plants in the front of my home having a bottle of pure aloe vera gel is nice to have on hand so I don't have to press my own gel.With ArtNaturals Aloe Vera Gel there is NO WATER ADDED and no colors added. It's totally pure. It also has no fragrances added and it is alcohol and oil free so what you get is just what you'd get out of a plant without having to press it yourself.I also love that they have included a pump top so that I can pump just what I need or change it over to a pour top if I needed that as well.Personally I prefer a pump top so I get just the right amount.I did get this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"Thi is a great wireless set of earbuds for when I'm working out at the gym.I like that I can go about 20 ft away from my bluetooth source before it dies out (such as away from my cellular phone).The color I got was the Orange and I like how it's more of a salmon organge than that of a tangerine color. So fashion forward these days.I've tested the time and it's lasted me as long as 5 hrs and 41 minutes so the time that it's quoting to be on a single charge of between 4-6 hours is extremely accurate. This is perfect for when working out for an hour or so at the gym. You'll have your tunes with you and still will be able to answer your phone and talk while working out on the treadmillIt takes approximately 2 hours to charge this device with the included short cord USB charger. The charging connection is on the side of the left earbud.It is extremely comfortable to wear and I like that it comes with other earpieces to get  a much more custom and comfortable fit.I love how the music actually sounds, though to be honest the bass is just a tad weaker then other earbuds I've owned this set is truly much better then most.I did get this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

" 2:55 Mins This is a great mattress protector. It's made form microfiber with a polyurethane laminate. I especially like that it was designed to fit mattresses that are thick and plush and up to 18 inches deep. This will protect your mattress from spills and stains and after all when we buy a mattress it is an investment not just another piece of furniture since we're going to sleep there each and every night.An encasement means it covers the ENTIRE mattress not just the top and sides and in doing so this will defend you against dust mites, the dreaded bed bugs, bodily fluids , skin flakes , bacteria, viruses , germs etc.It's not quilted and can be used either directly beneath the sheets or under a mattress pad. It is quite comfortable and it is very easy to wash.I've slept on it for a week now and I love how easy it is to use and how easy it was to remove and wash. I washed it the first time prior to putting it on my mattress and I removed it when I went to wash my sheets mainly to see how well it washed the second time. It washes extremely well. Just wash in cold water on the gentle cycle. DO NOT USE BLEACH as it WILL WEAKEN the threads. And you can either line dry this or put it in the dryer on low temperature. In my dryer it took about 35-40 minutes on low.This is by Home Sweet Home and it comes in all of your standard sizes. I opted for the Queen Size mattress encasement and I'm extremely pleased with it.I did receive this item for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.All of the opinions within this review are 100% my own, are based on my own experiences and use of this product and I was not compensated in any other way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F4T3JI4Z4Z7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125ESTME#wasThisHelpful","R2F4T3JI4Z4Z7L","A3984G9B5FXH64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3984G9B5FXH64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:21 Mins I love my GoPro 4 and the battery that comes with it is pretty descent but when you're hiking, or camping or even fishing or hunting and you run out of battery power it's often a big deal. Because how many times have you ran out of power when you just wanted to take a picture of that one special moment, that one bird, animal , flower or etc  but without the battery power you're unable to because it would take at least 1-2 hours to charge it?! Now you don't have to. These AHDBT-401 batteries are wonderful. And it even comes with its own charger. You can either recharge these batteries inside of the GoPro 4 itself OR you can charge them separately in the charger provided. And it even comes with the USB cord. The cord is about 3 ft so it's a perfect length when charging off of your laptop or desktop and it can even be charged off any other outlet w/ a USB port. That would include a car charger or even a solar charger that has a USB port. This way you're never without a charge.For ways I've used it with my Grandson please watch my video.I was provided this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

" 6:32 Mins This is a great and very durable cellphone windshield car mount! It comes in 2 pieces. The base which has a very large suction cup on the bottom and a clip to get the most suction possible and the second part that has the part that your phone will actually sit in once mounted.The part that holds the phone has a nut on the back that you just unscrew and then the ball of the base fits into the open space and you push them together till they click in place and are secure.Then all you do is clean your windshield and place the suction cup in place and clip it into place to hold it secure and then open up the place that holds your phone till it is open wide enough to secure it.this is much more durable then other similar phone mounts that adhere to the windshield that I've had in the past. First of all the suction cup is larger and is made with a clip to assure that it isn't coming loose. Secondly the rod that goes from the suction cup to the cellular phone mount is much thicker and much heavier and durable then others I've also had in the past.

"I really love how this band fits. It's terrific for any one (Male or female ) in a profession where electricity could possibly zap them and they can be electrocuted! Think of men and women in the military as well. It's a nice replacement band and I like that it is made from a very high quality silicone. I like that the band itself fits like a comfort band.It's also great if you're active and play a lot of sports. When you're active like this playing a lot of sports we sometimes, without even realizing it can lose our ring. This way we're assured we won't.I opted for the midnight blue  which is a very pretty deep blue..a cross between navy and royal blue and is very pretty and goes with just about anything.Some of the benefits of this ring are that it's waterproof, that it will NOT react with electricity, it's safe , non-toxic, and it is antibacterial so you know it is a top quality product.I also love the way it fits. I got a size 8 (the smallest size they offer) and it fits me perfectly the way a size 8 is supposed to fit. I wish this company would carry lower sizes for women who have smaller fingers as I know a few women who could benefit from this ring as well.I did get this product free, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

" 4:04 Mins This is a set of Glitter Body Tattoos . What I like about this set is you get 15 unique stencils , the body glitter glue, and 4 pots of glitter and 2 different brushes.To make a body glitter tattoo it's easy. Just pick your tattoo and remove the 2 layers of white from the back and stick it flat to your skin. Then remove the clear top layerNext put a layer of body glue in the open spaces and let settle about a minute so it's a bit sticky just not wet.Remove the stencil.Next open the pot of glitter you wish to use and use the smaller of the two brushes to pickup the glitter and place on the sticky / tacky gluelike substance and let dry.Finally take the larger bristled brush and remove any excess glitter.Now you're done.To keep the tattoo looking good do NOT put any lotion on it.To remove the tatoo, just use an alcohol pad and gently wipe it off.These are skin safe and FDA Compliant, as well as LATEX FREE.These body tattoos can last up to 7 days depending on your body type and that you don't use any lotions or perfumes with alcohol in them as alcohol helps remove them..I was given this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

" 3:07 Mins This is a great way to organize your makeup brushes , liners (Eyeliner and lip liner), mascaras, lipsticks and lip glosses.There are so many ways to organize your brushes (use the back row and organize your brushes by type, style, brand etc), organize mascaras by type, color or brand, etc.The possibilities are endless.The only thing that won't fit in this cosmetic organizer are the compacts for eye shadows or the little pots or tubs of bare minerals etc.But if it's a thin tube chances are it will fit and will help you be more organized on your counter.I like that the back actually sits up higher then the front which allows me to see what I want to use at a glance.I was provided this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

" 5:23 Mins This Mattress pad is a great high quality product. How do I know? My father had a textile/ linen store since before I was born and so I was raised in the industry.There are several ways to tell that this is very high quality. #1- The fact that it has the polyurethane backing instead of it being on top it's underneath (when the plastic coating is on top it will NOT last)... #2- the elastic is goes all the way around the entire pad attached to the skirting (the part that protects against the sides of the mattress. The cheaper versions of a mattress pad only have the elastic in the corners. #3- The sides are made of polyester so it has some give where pure cotton, while much more expensive has no give and therefore can and often will wear out sooner rather then later.  #4- It has even stitching throughout the quilting #5- The quilting is made of polyfiber filling #6- The surface is a nice soft microfiberThis mattress pad is very easy to clean..Just put it in either cold or warm wash and either line dry or dry in the dryer on a medium setting .No ironing is required and both times I washed this mattress pad it came out wrinkle free. (I washed it the first time a week ago prior to putting it on my mattress and tonight when I went to wash the sheets I went and took it off to wash to see how it would hold up. It did extremely well since it didn't have any loose threads.This mattress pad is designed to fit up to a 16 inch mattress so it went on my 14 in mattress with ease.This mattress pad was Anti-microbial treated to prevent bugs from coming and staying in it.This also protects against dust mites and bedbugs and it waterproof.Because it protects against dust mites this mattress pad is the perfect solution for those who suffer from allergies or who have asthma as a lot of asthmatic attacks are triggered by airborne allergies or microbes.This comes with a 100% satisfaction and quality guarantee so you can buy with confidence.I was provided this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

So if you are caught in a rainstorm, no worries your precious smartphone,  money , passport etc will not get wet or ruined.I also love this color. Most of my travelbags are black. Or on occasion I'd get a leather one that's brown . Of course the leather ones are extremely bulky and heavy. This is a very nice light khaki and goes with just about every color from black to brown and every color of the rainbow inbetween.Also one thing I've totally noticed about this Travelwey Travel Money Belt is that the belt clip to close the belt? It is NOT in plain site. With all the crooks in the world you don't want to make it easier for a crook to find the clip to come up and open it up on you and run. This is well hidden in the front under the second zipper and it truly CLIPS into place so a would be crook won't have an easy time so they'll probably go on to someone else that they can spot as an easy mark.I truly love this Travel Money Bag with the two zippers as both compartments are nice and deep. Yes the top zippered deeper compartment WILL be able to carry a iPhone 6S , a Passport and a few dollars while the second bottom compartment can carry your lipstick/ chapstick, and keys.On the back of this travel bag the parachute material has a sweat wicking back so that if you sweat it won't get all over the bag. This is one definitely thought out bag and as of today this is my most favorite Travel Money Belt.I was given this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.All of the opinions within this review are 100% my own, based on my own usage of this product as I was not compensated in any other way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA57J5PDV4QNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEWTAUC#wasThisHelpful","RA57J5PDV4QNS","A3984G9B5FXH64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3984G9B5FXH64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:21 Mins I love my GoPro 4 and the battery that comes with it is pretty descent but when you're hiking, or camping or even fishing or hunting and you run out of battery power it's often a big deal. Because how many times have you ran out of power when you just wanted to take a picture of that one special moment, that one bird, animal , flower or etc  but without the battery power you're unable to because it would take at least 1-2 hours to charge it?! Now you don't have to. These AHDBT-401 batteries are wonderful. And it even comes with its own charger. You can either recharge these batteries inside of the GoPro 4 itself OR you can charge them separately in the charger provided. And it even comes with the USB cord. The cord is about 3 ft so it's a perfect length when charging off of your laptop or desktop and it can even be charged off any other outlet w/ a USB port. That would include a car charger or even a solar charger that has a USB port. This way you're never without a charge.For ways I've used it with my Grandson please watch my video.I was provided this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is the story of male friendship, writ large. It is set mainly in New York and focuses on the character of Jude, who suffers physically, emotionally and psychologically with the crippling consequences of an abused childhood. The book is not for the squeamish.It's a slow grind through the gears to begin with as the reader struggles with Hanya Yanagihara's failure to delineate her characters sufficiently; with the exception of Jude, they remained indistinguishable to me for quite some time. But the book is not really about JB (the artist), Malcolm (the architect) and Willem (the actor), it is about Jude (the lawyer) - the self-loathing, self-harming Jude - whose 'little life' is anything but.In inverse proportion to the hatred he heaps upon himself, Jude is loved - idolised would not be too strong a word - by his friends and saviours. Their enduring care and kindness throughout the trials of his life are what form the major part of this story. There is a wonderful line where Jude introduces his mentor Harold Stein to his friends: ""He experienced the singular pleasure of watching people he loved fall in love with other people he loved."" Harold, who becomes Jude's father-figure, touched me more deeply than any other character and I found their scenes together far more weep-inducing than all the scenes of shocking degradation (which I found 'de trop').In fact, I found everything here too much: the abuse Jude suffers, his self-mutilation, his litany of glittering talents, his soaring career, his endless suffering, his endless mourning, his continual refusal to accept professional help. Even the length of the book will tell prospective readers that the author is not conversant with restraint and the words ""I'm sorry, I'm so sorry"" recur to the point of tedium.Because of the subject matter, A Little Life evokes Edward St Aubyn's Melrose quintet, scenes from which still haunt me after all these years. There's no doubt that Hanya Yanagihara can write - but she indulges a tendency to pile on the horror with a trowel. In contrast, St Aubyn carried off his semi-autobiographical masterwork with a great deal more panache and wit; as a consequence it was, in my view, all the more devastating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB8G1DQVTZWG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539258#wasThisHelpful","RB8G1DQVTZWG2","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The English, so often accused of snobbery, are rank amateurs compared to the 'old money' East Coast Americans - or, at least, the ones portrayed in novels - who seem to raise it to an artform. This story is about one such monied family: how they got it, what they do with it and what it does to them.Matriarch CeCe Somner is the quintessential rich bitch. She is old and her health is failing her. How dare it!! CeCe's caustic put-downs to family and staff are so biting and so nasty that they are almost too embarrassing to read. Her son George, cosseted with a sinecure and harbouring secret dreams of being a great opera librettist, has married beneath him. Naturally, CeCe loathes her daughter-in-law. She is also scathing about ""women of means who never tried to make use of themselves to the world. She disdains how well they wear their languor: their polished faces, and their veins, so close to the surface, like blue brocade."" (Killer simile.) When CeCe enters a private clinic to undergo experimental treatment for her degenerative condition, she finds a whole new raft of people to torture...Sarah McManus has a distinctive writing style - elegant, on occasion elusive - that suits her subject matter to a T. Whether Ms McManus's prose has been shaped to her story or whether the story has shaped her prose, it's impossible to tell; this being her dbut, we have nothing to compare it to. Initially, some of her more elliptic sentences may challenge the reader but we soon adjust to the author's rhythm, and as the story develops into something darker and altogether more complex, we realise that we are in the hands of an exceptionally talented new author. Her style - as polished as a Harry Winston diamond - works inordinately well in this striking new novel.And darling, what a divine cover.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L3WUZ8NFOQZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374114501#wasThisHelpful","R1L3WUZ8NFOQZV","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kikarin (Kiri) is eighteen years old and studying to gain a place at a good university. She is ferociously bright and stunningly beautiful. (Some reviewers have been irritated by how often her beauty is mentioned but this strikes me as valid since much of the story hinges on her appearance.) Kiri has a Japanese mother and an English father whose work as an arborist has necessitated a family move from London to the Scottish Borders. All things considered, she's adapting well to the new location but the attentions of the local lads are interfering with her intensive studies. With the release of her brother from prison, things are about to get a whole lot more complicated...W Scott Beaven slips into the character of Kiri like a glove. (How hard must it be for a male author to write from the point of view of an adolescent female, I can only imagine.) She is maddeningly inconsistent and judgemental but she is also, in my view, a wholly convincing creation and, I feel, a memorable one. Kiri carries all before her in a wildly over-the-top story with plenty of perplexing details and plot points. Nevertheless, I found this to be a highly original and intriguing novel. If you're looking for something that is utterly 'other', then here's a writer who offers something quite different.Thank you to the author for providing a complimentary copy of his book.

"One has to take one's hat off to Lisa Jewell. She surprises the reader with something different every time. Now here she is, tapping into the psychological thriller/chiller zeitgeist and making it her own.In The Girls she gives us a claustrophobic little tale about a group of people whose homes are clustered around an extensive communal garden in Hampstead. The discovery of an apparently sexually-motivated attack on a teenager launches the story and Jewell quickly builds up a picture of her strong cast of characters, the power games that young adolescents play and the interweaving relationships of the adults. This is most definitely not chick-lit - more like clique-lit - and the air of menace that hovers over the story compels the reader forward.I did have some quibbles though. Despite the line-drawing of the communal grounds at the outset of the book, I couldn't quite see this green urban space in my mind's eye. Since the garden is the focal point of the story, this for me was a failing. All of the main characters are convincingly portrayed but the dialogue of the police and medical staff did not strike me as realistic. A couple of continuity errors jarred. Otherwise though, this is an absorbing, well plotted novel written in the eminently readable style for which Lisa Jewell is so deservedly popular. 3.5*","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WQE8N503PCWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QDGVGKS#wasThisHelpful","R1WQE8N503PCWE","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Louis de Bernires' book opens as the sun goes down on the Victorian Age and rises on the promise of the new Edwardian era. It focuses on the affluent McCosh family, particularly daughter Rosie, and the impact that the First World War has on them. It's a tender-hearted mish-mash of a novel, told from many points of view.There are elements of wartime horror, elements of Downton, elements of spirituality, elements - it must be said - of soap. Despite the fact that the central thread of the book is about loss - the loss of loved ones, the loss of a way of life, the loss of purpose after war - the author's great good humour permeates much of the writing and lifts the book, in my view, from a 3* to a 4* rating.For me, two characters in particular hit home: Mr McCosh, with his entrepreneurial inventions, innate kindness and astute understanding of his eccentric family. And Mrs McCosh, inveterate snob, worshipper of royalty and frequent petitioner of the King. We are not privy to the letters that she sends him, only to the replies from Lt. Col. Sir Frederick Ponsonby, Secretary to His Majesty. These paradigms of diplomacy are alone are worth the price of admission.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27VNZZDHMNDXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101946482#wasThisHelpful","R27VNZZDHMNDXT","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When readers left Sea of Poppies, we were still aboard the groaning timbers of the Ibis and anxious to know the outcome of the voyage. One imagined that in the second part of the trilogy, we would discover everything that had happened to our fellow passengers and the members of the motley crew. Alas, with one or two exceptions, we are still somewhat in the dark - for Amitav Ghosh has chosen to take his sequel in another direction altogether.In River of Smoke, we are now (mainly) in Canton and (mainly) in the company of the opium traders. The author does not wear his learning quite so lightly here. We glean much about the trading quarter of Canton in the 1830s and the build-up to the Opium Wars, we learn about art and the search for rare plants, we glimpse the floating city and hear the speaking of pidgin. But it's not storytelling. Or, at least, not the masterful storytelling that so captured us in Sea of Poppies with its different threads of spellbinding yarns. However, as the impasse between the opium traders and the Chinese authorities comes to a head, the tension builds and as part of the continuing Ibis saga, it is an essential read.Now onto the third and final instalment, Flood of Fire...","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RSQFGUURW4XK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250013755#wasThisHelpful","R1RSQFGUURW4XK","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in the 1880s, Sarah Moss's sequel to Bodies of Light commences in limpid prose, poetry almost. Ally is now married to Tom and they have gone to live in his damp little rented cottage in Falmouth. He is about to sail for Japan to advise on lighthouse engineering and will be gone for six months. Ally is confronting the local prejudices of a woman having the effrontery to practise medicine and is about to take up her work as a doctor at the county asylum. It's not the most romantic of honeymoons.As the dual perspective of the story develops - Tom adjusting to Japanese ways, Ally shocked to her core at the harsh treatment of the asylum patients - so the reader adjusts to the writing style: rather formal, slightly chilly. But the gas is turned up when Ally returns to her parental home in Manchester and we shudder to see that her insufferably righteous Mamma has become ever more critical of her poor beleaguered daughter. I was tempted to sit on my hands for fear of strangling the woman.One wills Tom to return home safely to his new wife. One muses that he might take Ally back with him to Japan where the tranquil ways of Kyoto may bring her peace of mind. And one thanks heaven for kind, insightful Aunt Mary - easily my favourite character. With such moving sentiments and sentences, Sarah Moss is a writer who clearly deserves more mainstream attention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A7EPLLN7QFDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHA9CFA#wasThisHelpful","R3A7EPLLN7QFDQ","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been four years since Skippy died. That's quite a while between books. Like Paul, one of his characters in The Mark and the Void, perhaps Paul Murray has been suffering from writer's block. Or perhaps - and again like his character Paul - he's spent the time researching the ways of investment banks after the Irish boom went bust. (And here it's worth noting, perhaps, that the author has given this character his name.) Now, if that all sounds a bit meta, let me say straight off that Murray's new novel is the most tremendous fun.Claude, the hero, our narrator and a Frenchman, is a lonely bank analyst and so good at what he does that he gets head-hunted to join the rising Bank of Tarabundo in Dublin. One day, he notices that a man is tailing him. This is the aforesaid Paul, failed-author-turned-desperate-entrepreneur. Paul claims to be writing a new novel about banking and he wants to shadow Claude for the role of 'Everyman banker' in his book. Claude may be a highly intelligent financial analyst but he falls for Paul's 'shtick' hook, line and sinker.And so begins Murray's exploration of the Irish banking system, life, love, coffee breaks, lap-dancing joints and post-boom entrepreneurialism in the rain-lashed financial district of Dublin. The book features a gang of characters who have a kind of car-crash appeal. It is rather as though Jo Bronson's bond market satire of the 80s, Bombardiers, kissed the blarney stone. Hugely enjoyable - but fiscally a little scary. The minor characters are excellent too: Claude's whip-smart colleague Ish, his department manager Jurgen and sales wunderkind Howie are given most of the good lines but Paul's wife Clizia and his partner-in-crime Igor get their fair share too.The only real flaw is Claude's credulity which stretches ours beyond the limit. But as a well-natured satire on the materialism of our times, this has some pretty interesting things to say beneath the somewhat farcical elements of the plot. The ins and outs of bank trading in the post-Celtic Tiger period certainly come across as terrifyingly authentic and there are some splendid gags along the way.My thanks to Penguin Random House for an advance reading copy of this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFMZPE4MPR0N9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012P8DBQO#wasThisHelpful","RFMZPE4MPR0N9","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In America, sometime in the near future, the ultra-conservatives have won the day. Deregulation and privatisation have removed all forms of social support and the inequality between the haves and have-nots has become an unbreachable chasm. Credit-scoring is now an all-powerful weapon. Waves of subprimes - the homeless - scuttle from one outside encampment to another, desperate to scrape a living, put food in their children's mouths and escape the ever-looming threat of credit rehab.Into this dark scenario - which also includes apocalyptic global warming, fracking, hedge-fund fraud and the influence of a forceful tv evangelist - comes a welcome note of humanity in the form of a laid-back journalist (surely the voice of the author) who just wants his kids to lead a normal life. But what to make of the wonderwoman biker, Sargam, who puts others before herself? Will her belief in 'People Helping People' be enough to save this failing world?The writing hovers somewhat uncomfortably between literary humour and serious social comment, with a dash of even the supernatural. Karl Taro Greenfeld has perhaps overplayed his hand here but crucially seems to lack the courage of his own convictions; his simplistic bark is worse than his satirical bite. Whilst this is entertaining enough, The Subprimes fails to truly grip the reader's imagination. Well, this reader's at any rate.

Addie's son Gene has marital problems and brings his little boy to stay with his grandma. Will Gene look on his mother's new relationship any more benignly?This is what I would call a minimalist read; I don't think I saw a single adverb throughout. The late author, Kent Haruf, was a man of few words and even less punctuation. (The absence of speech marks worked surprisingly well in the recent novel Etta and Otto and Russell and James but here I found it distracting - an anti-flourish, if you like.)There's a great deal of quietly nuanced humanity here but not a grain of humour.

It's the tale of a lonely thirtysomething, Guylain Vignolles, who loathes - utterly loathes - his job at a plant, feeding unsold books into a giant pulping machine. The Thing, as he calls it. Every evening, he rescues a few stray clinging pages from its maws and reads them aloud on the train the following morning.

"War of the Encyclopaedists takes today's trend for the dual narrative to its logical conclusion: this is a book about two young men written BY two young men. One assumes that the authors were each responsible for one of the respective characters, Mickey Montauk and the rather fabulously named Halifax Corderoy, bright young men and best friends.Montauk shares a large Seattle house - the 'Encyclopad' - where he and Hal throw a series of achingly cool 'Encyclopaedists' parties, ironic affairs of local legend. At the last of these before their futures call, Hal's ambivalent feelings towards his exotic but wayward girlfriend Mani reach a turning point. As a reservist officer, Montauk has been called up to lead a platoon in Iraq (this is set in 2004/5) while Hal is off to study Lit Crit in Boston. But it's not just geography that is about to separate the two friends; the stage is set for something - or rather, someone - else to come between them. Just before the parting of the ways, they put together an entry on Wikipedia; this is the way they will communicate with one another. The Wiki pages serve to demarcate the two narrative arcs.The two authors interweave the threads of the story seamlessly in this collaborative novel. (I would love to know how they achieved this!) Their writing is just the right side of smart without being in the least showoff-y. Montauk's deployment in Iraq conveys the utter futility of the American mission, without recourse to histrionics. This is exemplified in a series of interview reports he conducts in a murder enquiry which make the point most effectively. Lt Montauk means well - but does he make good? Meanwhile Hal, broke and increasingly reliant on booze, is finding his post-grad course equally - if less momentously - futile. Christopher Robinson and Gavin Kovite have woven an interesting late coming-of-age story that sheds light on the American malaise of ""no good deed going unpunished"". Warmly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12N0I1EBBYFR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476775427#wasThisHelpful","R12N0I1EBBYFR6","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was absolutely bowled over by this brilliant idea. It's a children's book that combines the charm of a traditional kids' story with the technology to transform the tale into an amazing 3-D adventure.How does it work? It's so simple! Instructions are inside the book. You just pop the free Arbi app onto your smartphone or tablet and then hold your device just above the book's illustrations. Knights, cats, dogs and fire-breathing dragons - all spring instantly to life on the screen! Sounds like magic? Well, it is, kind of. The technology is called 'augmented reality' and it really is very clever indeed.The story itself is perfect for 5-8 year olds and has a kind of universal appeal plus a positive message - teamwork is a great thing. The type is friendly and fun. The characters are appealing. And when you add the 3D dimension, you can be sure that young readers will get a real kick out of this.Perhaps one day all books will be like this.

"Chen Guangcheng is the fifth son born to a poor farming family in a tiny village in rural China. Without access to medicine, a childhood virus leaves him incurably blind - but even from this early age, Guangcheng is not to be beaten by his disability: he has an indomitable will to learn and study. As he grows up, few career paths are open to him (the most acceptable work for the blind is road-side story-telling - a glorified form of begging). Eventually, Guangcheng is accepted at a distant college to learn acupuncture and massage, the only forms of ancient Chinese medical study permitted to the blind. When he arrives there, he soon discovers that the law entitling the disabled to free public transport is not being honoured.So begins Guangcheng's journey as a self-taught legal activist fighting to protect civil and human rights - and not just for the disabled. His heroic struggle against China's inhumane methods of dealing with population control is the one that incenses the authorities, leading to trumped up charges against him and a prison sentence. But it is his treatment by the squads of Party thugs after his release that is the hardest to endure. He must escape from his own - heavily guarded - home.This is an eye-opening account of state-sponsored brutality that is harrowing enough to read. Who can possibly imagine what it must have been like for Guangcheng and his family to live through? So brave is the author in his fight against injustice that there were many occasions reading this that I quite forgot he was blind; when I reminded myself of his disability, I stood in complete awe of his courage and endurance. One of the few guards to show dismay cries out: ""Where's the humanity? This is an abomination!"" The guard is quickly removed from the team.The simple fact is that Chen Quangcheng would never have escaped his persecution but for the pressure brought to bear from the outside world - particularly the United States. This book should be required reading for anyone who has any dealings with or any interest in China. I now see the country in a whole new light - a very dark and most unpleasant one.The author talks about the many messages of support he received over the years: ""Those who wrote to me then, and those who have since written other such letters, should know the great value messages like these have for a political prisoner. May they never stop coming."" Please consider this my message of support, Mr Chen Guangcheng.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C057PT5AL9UT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPCCJI0#wasThisHelpful","R3C057PT5AL9UT","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer is billed as the new Girl on the Train which was billed as the new Gone Girl. Does raising expectations to such a degree inevitably lead to disappointment? Well, admittedly, the initial premise of the main protagonist coming across herself in a novel is enticing. But Ms Knight then proceeds to toy with the reader, on and on she teases, until it's hard to escape the feeling that we are being unduly and rather meanly manipulated.It is immensely difficult to engage with any of these characters. It's not a matter of them being dislikeable (they are) but something more fundamental in that they fail to ring true on any level. This produces a don't-care-two-hoots response from the reader that is, frankly, fatal. Towards the end, they all perform such a volte-face that they become - if this is indeed possible - even more implausible.The odious ins and outs of the plot left me feeling faintly grubby and I was pleased to wash my hands of the whole thing. So no. Not as good as The Girl on the Train or Gone Girl.

"I defy anyone not to be pulled into this book by Ryan Gattis's powerful opening chapter which is both abhorrent and heartrending in equal measure. In a multi-viewpoint narrative, the author then goes on to explore the collateral damage from the Los Angeles street riots of 1992. With the police and rescue services stretched to breaking point, the gang members of South Central quickly recognise an opportunity to settle old scores.Like The Wire, the stories interconnect and the voices sound authentic - but the graphic scenes of violence are almost relentless. Mercifully, one catches an occasional glimpse of humanity amidst the gangs' ruthless executions of revenge.The chapter about a covert special ops raid is particularly effective: '...some desk-riding, newly flown-in marine commander with more stripes on his sleeve than sense told me that not firing unless fired upon was the only thing separating us from the gangs. ""Separating us, sir?"" I said to his overly serious face. ""We ARE a gang.""'

"Growing up with her twin brother Osiris in the faded grandeur of Little Egypt, the family's country seat, thirteen-year old Isis is impatient for her life to start. She can't wait for her parents, obsessive Egyptologists, to return home with the chimeric rewards of their dig. As she dreams of the house returned to its former glory, perhaps then Isis will have what she wants most in the whole world: a normal family life. In present time, eighty years on, it is clear that this was never to be. The aged Isis may now have switched her name around to Sisi (and who can blame her?) but her life was not to be so easily turned about.Lesley Glaister shapes her dual time frame into a perfectly paced narrative arc. And what a great phrasemaker she is! Frozen puddles 'like plates of iron'. Nettle rash that 'stings like sherbet'. An early memory of licking rust is 'rather how she thought war might taste, deep blood and gritty metal'. Without a trace of sentiment or saccharine, the heartrending nature of this appealing character's unfulfilled life pulls at the heartstrings (before the story's descent into Grand Guignol which I'm afraid cost the book a star). It's a long time since I've read a book and so fervently wanted to give its young heroine a hug.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LFMR8V1FUIB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7SLDXY#wasThisHelpful","R1LFMR8V1FUIB1","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Take as your basic stock, the author's own unique blend of caustic humour and exuberant nihilism peppered with pungent insights into the 21st century zeitgeist. Add a handful of ber-nebbish Woody Allen, a sprinkling of A.M. Homes, a soupon of Adam Mars-Jones and a dash of Amis at his darkest. Mix thoroughly and leave to bubble for 430 pages and what you have is a mordantly funny tour-de-force that had me at hello.Steve Toltz's impressive debut 'A Fraction of the Whole' was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2008 so one can only assume that he's been cooking up this second novel for quite some time. But enough with the culinary metaphors; what's Quicksand actually about?Liam Wilder, would-be author and unlikely cop, has an unshakeable friendship with the irresistible but exasperating Aldo Benjamin. Aldo is a remarkably unlucky guy: a serially failed entrepreneur and spectacularly unsuccessful suicide. He's beginning to suspect he might even be immortal - and given the mutilated state of his body, that's not a prospect to relish.Great lines come fast and furious and there are innumerable passages of brilliant writing. Two stand-out chapters cement Steve Toltz's place in the contemporary literary pantheon: 'The Interview, or Terms and Conditions' in which Liam conducts an official police interview with Aldo. And, in a subsequent but unrelated court case, 'The Madness of the Muse' in which Aldo makes a lengthy plea to the jury that becomes the stuff of legend.Although the setting is Sydney, the writing has very much the feel, wit, inventiveness and sheer courage of the very best American fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18NM04D18CKZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE3HF70#wasThisHelpful","R18NM04D18CKZ0","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Elements of a conventional murder mystery play out against the background of Paris's cultural melting pot in a moderately intriguing plot that keeps readers on their toes (it's quite hard to follow). This opens with the discovery of the murder victim by blood dripping from the woman's body onto the young Arab owner of the balcony beneath. The apartment block is situated in a neighbourhood where Salafists and orthodox Jews co-exist peaceably by ignoring one another. The murder victim is the daughter of Jehovah's Witnesses. Religion swirls around the various tangled threads of the story, as do the mysterious blue pills that are suddenly flooding the city. Which will be the key to unlocking the case?This is an unusual thriller that borders on the literary and yet I found it curiously unengaging. Whether this is due to the shortcomings of the author, the translator or this reader, I honestly don't know. The writing veers between the present and past tense and between the clumsy and the adept. There is a great deal of exposition, even - and unforgivably - in the dialogue. An odd book, this. Its contextual setting makes it relevant to the world we live in today but in the final hundred or so pages, the plot descends into abject drivel.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VYP9KWHLLFKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IS05L30#wasThisHelpful","R3VYP9KWHLLFKQ","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This slender novel not only hits home - it has also hit a home run. Akhil Sharma's tragi-comedy has recently been awarded the Folio prize for excellence in writing. It has been fourteen years since Akhil Sharma's debut, An Obedient Father. The answer as to why it has taken so long for his second book to reach us is perhaps contained in its semi-autobiographical pages.When Ajay's accountant father sends airline tickets for his wife and two sons to join him in America, their whole Delhi neighbourhood comes out to celebrate the family's good fortune. Ajay is eight and can't quite believe this is really happening. As many an immigrant experience story has shown, the Mishras' new life in 'the land of opportunity' is a challenging one for them to navigate. But it is a devastating accident that changes everything more fundamentally for the Mishra family - and for Sharma's readers.This is a deeply moving, funny, tragic, absorbing and brave account with an engagingly honest narrator. The author compels the reader to examine some of life's darker questions by leaving much unsaid and demonstrates here that less really can be more. A novel of 'distilled complexity' and 'deceptive simplicity' said the Folio judges. I agree.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CW74PJIJDJIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393350606#wasThisHelpful","R2CW74PJIJDJIW","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In terrifically readable style, Bill Browder takes us from the communist background of his family (his grandfather led the American Communist Party and twice stood for president) through to his defiant determination to carve his own career path in capitalism. And carve it he did.Identifying a timely opportunity to capitalise on Russia's opening up of the markets, the then 28-year old Browder doggedly pursued wealthy global investors whose input enabled him to form his own investment company, Hermitage Capital, a roller-coaster hedge fund that saw phenomenal profits as well as devastating losses.No-one will be surprised to hear that Browder made some ruthless enemies along the way, eventually leading to his being barred from the country. This is the story of a man who wouldn't allow the sinister Russian machine to steamroller over him and of the collateral damage that was inflicted on his associates by a corrupt system.

"Claire Fuller's debut novel tells the story of an 8-year old whose father, fearing the end-days are approaching, abducts her to live a feral existence in a remote forest in Germany. Her mother, a German concert pianist, had been away on tour when her husband and daughter disappear. She does not see Peggy again for nine years. The story is narrated by the daughter across two time frames, her harrowing existence in Germany and her return to London.The writing is eloquent and touching, though perhaps the descriptive passages of trees, leaves and other related greenery could have done with a little judicious pruning. For me, the parts of the story set in 1985 when Peggy has returned home were by far the more interesting but these, I felt, were not given their due. This side of the story seemed somehow unresolved.

"For anyone who is interested in politics or advertising, this eminently readable book will provide fascinating insight into these two worlds that perhaps have more in common than they would like to think. First and foremost, they both have to sell themselves. (As an agency boss once said: ""My assets go down in the elevator every night."")Sam Delaney treats us to some rather wonderful anecdotes and demonstrates the strained relationships that have always existed between political parties and their advertising agencies: the clash of egos, the creative challenges, the fact that both politics and advertising are inexact sciences where the proof of advertising's ability to influence elections is well nigh impossible to verify.How timely to read this in the run-up to Britain's 2015 general election!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PNPVQLAX1N2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PPH081E#wasThisHelpful","R3PNPVQLAX1N2Q","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two young Englishmen, Adam and Neil, meet on a rough-and-ready holiday in California in the early 90s. Adam is good looking, from a comfortably off background, confident and comfortable in his skin. Neil less so in all departments. An incident occurs during a group trip to the Yosemite National Park that has lasting consequences for their relationship. It forms a schism much like the park's famous 'Siamese-twin' sequoias - 'The Faithful Couple'. It's an obvious metaphor perhaps but their bromance is nevertheless very well drawn.Miller conveys the ambivalence of their relationship - its interdependence, its resentments, its rivalry, its betrayals, its love - in terms that are in no way homoerotic. This male friendship, set against the ebb and flow of London's financial fortunes, is one the reader can believe in.The writing has an unpretentious precision that gives it a faintly unsettling edge: ""When Neil thought of the randomness of it, all the reasons it could have been extinguished, not just the primordial grievance but neglect or drift or routine jealousy, his friendship with Adam was like a whim of evolution, a platypus or an anteater, so precious and unlikely. Even now, even these last few years, there was no one he trusted or needed so much.""

"Mary Anne, daughter of a sailor, widow and twelve years' Disraeli's senior made an odd choice for a rising politician's wife. Ah, but she had money. Whatever the motives for the marriage, it suited both of them and it stood the test of time. Mary Anne was unfailingly supportive of 'her Dizzy' who stood up for his wife when society hostesses and Tory bigwigs made fun of her overblown attire and garrulous chatter which sometimes shocked.Daisy Hay has clearly done an admirable amount of research, quoting extensively from letters (Mary Anne kept every scrap of paper that was ever written to her) but I found this rather a dry read. It perks up at about the halfway point when Mary Anne and Dizzy marry and it becomes increasingly interesting as Disraeli's political star rises.With Dizzy's shameless schmoozing and Mary Anne's heartfelt sincerity, they eventually managed to overcome the queen's initial distaste (marital devotion was something Queen Victoria could identify with and heartily approved of). The rest of the country followed suit, taking Mary Anne to their hearts.

"This is the first of Karl Ove Knausgaard's six-volume masterwork, 'My Struggle', a journal-style reflection on the minutiae of his life at various ages and stages. Some say it's compelling. Others that it's boring in the extreme. Coming late to the party, I am in two minds whether I'm pleased to have made it or not.I puzzle at the need to go into such minute detail, for instance he might say words to the effect: 'I went upstairs and went into my bedroom which was the third door on the right' or 'I lit my cigarette with my brother's green, semi-transparent lighter'. Who gains from such a level of elaboration? What does it matter? But it is Knausgaard's book, his to write as he pleases. And there's no doubting his success; he has almost rock-star status in Norway and good luck to him.Is the title ironic? I think it must be as there is no discernible struggle that one can make out. His father may have been withholding but he doesn't (thus far) appear to be an ogre. His mother may be wonderful but we never catch more than a brief glimpse of her. The author may have been a rebel in his youth but that's hardly remarkable. One thing is certain: Knausgaard's literary life is paramount and everything and everyone is subordinated to it. He has an ego the size of a Norwegian wood.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GLNBQI3I2HZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00755HTNY#wasThisHelpful","R1GLNBQI3I2HZS","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Novelists these days seem to have ditched the linear narrative. So many plots today are served up in different time frames or with different narrators or with different apparently unrelated threads, it's almost as if the authors fear their stories won't be strong enough to withstand a straightforward story line. Or perhaps it is that they're subconsciously meeting the demands of an attention-diminished readership in this internet-distracted age. I never thought though that Anne Tyler - of all writers - would succumb to this technique but succumb she has in her latest novel, the (rather wonderfully named) A Spool of Blue Thread.This is the story of an ordinary Baltimore family (as we've come to know, love and expect from Anne Tyler) and the difficulties that arise as the two steadfast parents, Red and Abby, exhibit worrying signs of aging. The three children and their families who live nearby do what they can to help; the fourth - the reliably unreliable Denny - drops in and out of their lives and concerns. Anne Tyler can usually convey her characters in a single sentence. Not so here; it takes a while to get a handle on them all. But in any event, the main character in this book is their beloved house - or more precisely, its spacious front porch where many of the family scenes are set.At about the halfway point, Anne Tyler throws an upset into the story that plot-spoiling precludes me from telling but this is as nothing compared to the real curve ball: when she subsequently goes back in time to the Depression and the story of Red's parents. This extended flashback is jarring, and - quite frankly - tedious in the telling. To me, it is extraneous as it fails to illuminate the story proper and neither of the two antecedents have much to offer in the way of appeal. In fact, most of the characters here are a pretty disappointing shower - with the honourable exception of the house. I am a great fan of Anne Tyler's and feel almost that I'm personally letting her down by not having enjoyed this book more. I do hope it's not her last.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZGYNQKXJ7CF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101874279#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZGYNQKXJ7CF","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2.5 starsRoger Cohen's disjointed diaspora story will be a familiar one to many Jewish readers. Forebears fleeing pogroms, escapees from Nazism, immigrants adapting to a new life in a new land (in his grandparents' case, South Africa, in his parents' case, England), how much to assimilate, how much to retain a Jewish identity. There are harrowing moments in the Lithuanian sections and discomforting ones in South Africa with the dubious moral stance of the Jewish community who no longer find themselves the underdogs. (Quite hard to stomach, these.)This family memoir lacks a cohesive narrative arc and flits about all over the place making it very hard to follow. It is overshadowed throughout by the genetically-disposed depression (possibly manic-depression) of Cohen's mother, June. There are many family photographs; one in particular shows her as an apparently happy, smiling young woman with her children. Cohen analyses this picture at length and reads all sorts of dire things into it that were simply not discernible to this baffled reader. Later in the book, he takes a lengthy detour to Israel, telling the story of a distant cousin, also suffering from depression, and interweaving it with the problems of the region. He seems to conflate mental ill health with the story of Zionism: ""Nobody understood her. Nobody understood Israel."" He labours the point without making the case.As well as confusing in the telling, there are random shifts of tense and much of the writing is inelegant - on occasion, embarrassingly florid. Cohen almost redeems the book with one very good chapter where he talks about his own education at Westminster and the insidious version of anti-Semitism that bubbled up - or perhaps that should be trickled down - from Britain's establishment in the 1960s. Other than that, it's hard to believe that the author - now a naturalised American - is a journalist for the New York Times. You'd have thought that marshalling a great deal of information and distilling it into a readable form would be one of the key requirements of the job.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q365IOTZLKLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307594661#wasThisHelpful","R1Q365IOTZLKLE","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Emma Hooper has written a unique and enchanting story. It appears from its title to be about four characters - and so it is. But really, I think, it's a story of place: a dust-blown prairie in Saskatchewan where life is led at a different pace, with different priorities and different courtesies and perhaps even with different feelings.The inevitable comparisons to The Pilgrimage of Harold Fry should be cast aside. Etta's 2000-mile odyssey is hardly the central tenet of the book. This is so much more besides. A story not only of place but also of states of mind. Longing, loss, memory, companionship, small happinesses. I am struggling to convey the essence of the thing and, stylistically, it might not be for everyone. Please allow me instead to quote at length:So what shall we do? Otto said the next morning at breakfast, cinnamon buns, oranges.Maybe I should go away, said Etta. A place for people who forget themselves.But I remember, said Otto. If I remember and you forget, we can balance, surely.Maybe I should go away, said Etta, again. Her hair was white and undone. The piece of it that fell towards her mouth reminded Otto of baby geese. A return to down.I could hurt someone, she said. The cinnamon bun on her plate a perfect spiral, tucking into itself, away and down. Perfect.You won't.You know I won't?I know you won't.They ate, for a while, and then Etta said, What will you do today?Go to Palmer's, I think. Help out there a bit.Wear a hat. The sun.Of course. And you?Etta had one hand on the table, her left, she spread her fingers flat. Pickles, she said, carrots and garlic and cucumber.It's a long time till winter.But it never really is.No, I guess it never really is.Lastly, I would like to compliment Penguin on their beautiful UK edition of this book.

"Alan Cumming uses the format of alternating chapters to shape his memoir, going from his heart-rending upbringing at the hands of his appalling bully of a father to the background and build-up to his appearance on 'Who Do You Think You Are?' in 2010.This talented actor comes across as a thoroughly decent, honest and caring person. Personally, I could have done with less about his heroic, war-traumatised grandfather, as this particular thread seemed to go on a bit. Although one doesn't wish for the stereotypical showbiz style autobiography, I would like to have heard just a little more about Alan Cumming, the man.It would have been interesting, for instance, to hear how it felt to go from his childhood in rural Scotland to landing the pivotal role of the Emcee in Cabaret on the London stage (and thence to Broadway). And although I am not remotely fussed to know anything about Alan Cumming's sex life, it might have been interesting to know what it was like for him at the emotional level to go from marriage to a wife to marrying a husband.Nevertheless, this is a touching read and one can only say 'bravo' to the nice Mr Cumming who has come through the trials and tribulations of his early life with flying colours. Playing against type, his convincing performance as the straight, Jewish political fixer in The Good Wife is surely a triumph.

A lonely boy, son of a once wealthy family now set on auto-destruct, he spends most of his young life at boarding school whilst his father battles depression and his mother gives priority to her horses. Sebastian's unusual way of looking at things leads him to become a photographer and eventually a star of Berlin's modern art scene.The writing style in the first half of this story is oddly flat. No doubt the spare, stilted sentences are intended to reflect the enigmatic nature of the main protagonist but I found the prose unappealing and uninvolving. Then, just after the halfway point, a young woman connected to von Eschburg disappears and he is accused of her murder, at which point the author changes gear quite markedly.Enter the leading - but ailing - defence attorney, Konrad Biegler, and things perk up considerably. Biegler's brilliant brain and unapologetic grumpiness make him an engaging character, and even though I could see the ending coming from a mile off, the legal part of this book lifts it from a 2 to a 3-star rating. All in all, though, I found this to be a disappointing follow-up to The Collini Case and can only suggest that Herr von Schirach sticks to his familiar milieu of the courtroom in future - this is where he shines.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16DJ3DZGTMHI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFPBB9I#wasThisHelpful","R16DJ3DZGTMHI0","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A fascinating study of Chinese food by a writer who is passionate about the subject and entirely without ego. Whether slurping Dan Dan noodles in her beloved Chengdu, mastering the art of the cleaver at cooking school or travelling far and wide to track down such esoterica as hairy crab or Qingxi Tribute pepper, Fuschia Dunlop comes across as intrepid, honest and entirely likeable.There are times when you will need a strong stomach. Here she is describing what it's like to eat sheep's lungs: ""The pale lungs are smooth as custard, floury as a white sauce, chubby as a cheesecake. In fact, with a little added sugar you might imagine you were eating an English pudding, if it wasn't for the odd tube poking out...""Fuschia Dunlop's absorbing account of regional Chinese cooking was first published in 2008. As this complex country opens itself up increasingly to the outside world, how interesting it is now to catch sight of the last shadowy wisps of the Cultural Revolution and to look back - just a few years - to the time when China was on the cusp of such seismic change.In an otherwise faultless book, the paperback edition that I read had small print and poor paper quality. Ms Dunlop deserved better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34EWVX0TIE80B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4SNSO4#wasThisHelpful","R34EWVX0TIE80B","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deceptively simple, brilliantly clever, this well-written twisty thriller will replace the Gone Girl-shaped hole in your reading life. It's told from three different points of view: alcoholic Rachel who views the life she should be living from her daily commute. Megan, the beautiful but disturbed woman who lives a few doors away from Rachel's old home. And Anna who is now happily ensconced in that home with Rachel's ex-husband and a baby daughter.All three female characters are well portrayed, as are the men they're involved with, and Rachel's alcoholism is utterly convincing. Paula Hawkins manages the reader's expectations with some subtlety and often to thrilling effect. If I had but one quibble it was with the denouement which was a little too dragged out and didn't live up to the promise of the book. But that's often the way, I find, with these classy thrillers and this one is first class. It will compel you forward like a bullet train - do grab a seat. 4.5*","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JLWEELACTRGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOPQU2K#wasThisHelpful","R3JLWEELACTRGP","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sandip Roy's debut is not quite a conventional novel nor quite a collection of short stories. It's more a series of vignettes that, taken together, create a convincing portrait of an arranged marriage with an undercurrent of suppressed and unspoken yearnings. I particularly loved home-sick Romola exorcising her demons by reciting in her head a litany of spices: ""Turmeric, coriander, methi...""It's not quite the usual 'immigrant experience' story either. When Avinash brings his new bride to America, Romola fails to settle and not long after their baby is born, she insists on the family's return to Calcutta. It is their son Amit who comes back to study and eventually settle in the States.The book opens with the discovery of a fragment of an old letter that reveals a long-hidden secret. If you can resist the temptation to read the inside fly-leaf, you may find this revelation will surprise you (it did me). From this point, Roy surprises the reader further by ditching the narrative arc altogether and embarking on a series of 'snapshots' of his main protagonists at different stages of their lives.Some of these are successful: Avinash's hatred of haircuts when he was a boy, the great-grandmother with her secret stash of rainy-day mango chutney, Aunt Meena's rare visit from Boston which has a shocking outcome. Others not so much: the story of Romola's young love for a Bollywood star before he became famous didn't really work for me. But ultimately, these simply told stories add up to more than the sum of their parts. A surprising - and surprisingly affecting - read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R399RCXBRI81UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R9EQEYG#wasThisHelpful","R399RCXBRI81UR","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to the blurb, the wonderfully named Ariel Kafka thinks of himself first and foremost as a cop, secondly as a Finn and lastly as a Jew. In the second instalment of this Helsinki-based police procedural series, the plot once again revolves around murder within the tiny Jewish Helsinki community. There's the kernel of a good idea here but once again the characters, the plot, the dialogue, the detail, the denouement - all fail to deliver. There is no sense at all of place and Helsinki remains for the reader a city of Scrabble-shelf street names.

"I've never quite bought into Tolstoy's quote ""All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" So it hardly surprised me that the unhappy family presented here is like many others but Philip Teir makes a decent fist of probing their standard-issue fault-lines. The setting is present-day Helsinki and the atmosphere in the Paul family's spacious modern apartment is almost as cold as the weather outside.Husband and sociology professor Max Paul is fast approaching sixty and 'fighting vainly the old ennui'. He hankers for the professional renown of his youth - and a younger woman. His competent wife Katriina, meanwhile, hankers for another drink and a new kitchen. Their marriage has become an endurance test - much like Max's metaphorical matches on the tennis court. They have two daughters: vapid Helen, the least defined of the characters, and her infinitely more interesting younger sister Eva, a self-aware but somewhat immature 29-year old who is forever prolonging her studies - this time, with an aimless art course in London.This debut novel is well written and 'invisibly' translated by Tiina Nunnally but the author has a tendency to dart hither and thither with his narrative and to leave threads hanging. Whilst this book could hardly be accused of being an earth-shattering read, it's a convincing contemporary story with recognisable and, on the whole, well-rounded characters. Helsinki makes for an unusual setting for British readers...though why Eva should miss her native city's seasons while she's living in London beats me. We have four seasons, don't we?

"It's the summer of 1953 and the post-war gloom is starting to lift: the new queen has been crowned, Hillary has conquered Everest, the Ashes will soon be returned to their 'rightful' place. At Chartwell, as Winston concludes his splendid after-dinner toast to an Italian delegation, he suddenly slumps back in his chair. Fatigue - or something far more ominous?Churchill's slow recovery from a stroke must be kept secret from the world at all costs. His wingman, Anthony Eden, is also seriously ill and undergoing surgery in Boston. The UK is without governance. Churchill's tightknit group close ranks to keep the general public out of the loop. Despite such weighty subject matter, this is in fact a very bright and breezy read. With the bare minimum of exposition, Jonathan Smith tells us the story of those difficult summer months largely through dialogue - and what a masterclass it is. This book should be required reading on writing courses!All the players spring vividly to life from these 200-odd pages. The irascible yet irresistible Churchill. His stressed wife Clementine who longs for him to retire (and the only person towards whom he evinces any fear: ""...whatever you do, don't tell Clemmie.""). Smart Jock Colville, the Prime Minister's politically astute private secretary who rarely sees eye to eye with Churchill's long-serving doctor, Charles Moran, a man who would appear to have had a sense of humour bypass. And last but by no means least, the exemplary Nurse Appleyard who surprises everyone by getting her prickly patient onside. Congratulations to Jonathan Smith on his fine achievement. This couldn't be more entertaining - or more highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZKMA8PWLOU2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTUC6DY#wasThisHelpful","R2ZKMA8PWLOU2Q","A3K5FR4LTO7E9V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K5FR4LTO7E9V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A moderately diverting crime thriller given the added twist of a Helsinki setting and a Jewish cop. Harri Nyknen provides us with a high body count and a promising main character in the shape of Ariel Kafka but gives us no sense at all of the location, which is disappointing. The author is awarded huge brownie points for resisting the temptation to give the cop a crumby relationship with his boss. But then loses the lot with the dubious moral ambiguity of his denouement.To see how this minuscule niche genre of Jewish detective fiction can really surprise and scintillate, check out Michael Chabon's brilliant The Yiddish Policemen's Union or Derek B.

"Michael Winterbottoms film Trishna was made way back in 2011 and released in 2012, but here Caldera records was able to do a very nice release of Shigeru Umebayashis string-based score to the romantic melodrama. The story follows a lower class servant falling in love with a rich mans son. She relocates with him where their love would be less taboo and it exposes a dark twist when he begins to get a rise out of the idea of being an all-powerful upper class man with control over her. The score accents and speaks to the inner dance these two characters weave as Trishna finds herself in a seemingly overbearing situation.Shigeru Umebayashi is a fantastic composer who probably gained your attention with his collaborations with director Wong Kar-wai. Here he completely ignores the Indian setting and allows no ethnic influences into the score. The film features a pulsing Indian soundtrack though with songs from Bollywood composer Amit Trivedi. Non of that is featured here so what we have here is Shigeru Umebayashis score working on its own. It make's sense that the tracks sort of work as movements versus a completely strung together narrative. By sequencing certain tracks 1, 2, and 3 you can pick up the internal flow of those pieces. You sense the music progressing and pushing while the music always carries a tone of despair. The score can feel too monotonous at times given its simple and minimal instrumentation, but structurally its very strong. The use of a waltz sort of clashed with me personally at first, but by the third movement of the waltz it felt right. Overall the score showcases some strong structural narrative flows within the connected motifs and thats where the real heart of the music lies.Trishna is an interesting small-scale score from acclaimed composer Shigeru Umebayashi. The simple and streamlined instrumentation could have used a little more textural work to make the music stick better. As it stands though you will find some interesting motifs connected in movements throughout the narrative of the score. The score carries the sense of despair through most of it, which makes it feel one-note at times, but there is a deep pain to Trishnas journey and the music carries us through the ultimately inevitable dark ending.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KI8VL1FS8U47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQ8FXW6#wasThisHelpful","R3KI8VL1FS8U47","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lost For Words is your typical outsider American falling in love with a native girl, and stopping at nothing to be with her despite their differences and their past. This time the story follows an American who moves to Hong Kong and falls in love with a beautiful dancer. Cue the melodramatic score from German composer Andre Matthias. Thankfully the music is handled with enough care and is texturally engaging enough that it is surprisingly good.The score indeed does a wonderful job of painting a blossoming romance amidst an exotic locale. The score treats everything so overly important and dramatic at times that it cant help but feel melodramatic. But also, the writing and instrumentation is gorgeous in certain parts. The music will cast a romantic spell on you for sure, and it doesnt feel or sound like your typical Hollywood romantic drama. In fact its in the scores small and quiet stretches, and thankfully there are lots, where the music truly shines. There is a hint of Chinese flavoring to the music, well maybe a little more than a hint. But it never overbears us with the ethnic sound to the point of overtaking the score. I like how the score wraps up in the final act the most despite its grand reach to be epically sweeping.Lost For Words follows the typical formula of an American guy falling in love in some distant foreign land, and for the most part the score follows in suit of that. Thankfully there is enough momentum and interesting textures to make Matthias score a worthy sweeping romance score. Yes, its melodramatic and yes it can be too grand for its own good. But in the end there is enough here that works to make it a compelling journey.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11QYHQR7CW4OR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y1MF9V8#wasThisHelpful","R11QYHQR7CW4OR","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Man Up is a comedy about a teen slacker who gets his Mormon girlfriend pregnant and has to immediately grow up and change his life. This isnt to be confused with the Simon Pegg film of the same name. Man Ups comedy is definitely physical with lots of gag scenarios. This is the directorial debut of actor Justin Chon who was in the Twilight films and 21 & Over. It also marks the composing debut of Wendy Wang. The film is very low budget so Im sure the cast and crew is made up of lots of friends and acquaintances. Wendy Wang is a Los Angeles native who has a rich musical background. Here she is able to put on display a fantastic stylistic approach that ultimately is just used to pepper the film with sound bursts instead of actually writing a score.Sadly, there isnt much music here and therefore it doesnt congeal into anything beyond stylistic 80s aesthetic bursts. There are 21 tracks that total 19-minutes of score, with a couple songs by Wendy and other collaborators. So in a sense, the music really is only adding a sonic style for the film to exist around. The sound is very punchy and attention-grabbing, which is great. It totally fits the films aesthetic, and probably tries its best to stay away from the comedy onscreen. That is an important thing to remember, this films comedy is physical with tons of falling and wide-eyed expressions. I think goofy would be a good term to describe it. So its possible the directive was to only provide musical punches instead of fabricating a traditional score. But even if that was indeed the case, youd still want the music to be doing something more even in a screwball comedy. And the music here simply fails to do anything emotional or character-driven.Man Up provides an interesting retro soundscape for this screwball comedy, and definitely shows newcomer Wendy Wang has talent. But as a score its not doing much in terms of narrative supplement. The bursts of music serve really only one purpose, and thats to be loud and stylistic. I know comedy is hardest genre when it comes to music, but there was definitely room to do something more substantial and developed here.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R138Z5IX3BEBZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQWZZHG#wasThisHelpful","R138Z5IX3BEBZI","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The crime-fighting youth genre has seen many incarnations and takes over the years. I get the idea of trying to appeal to a market of teens and tweens to make them feel on the level of adults in cool action scenarios. You can either go for the young demographic and keep it light like Agent Cody Banks or the Spy Kids franchise, or go balls-out and make a stylistic romp like Kick-Ass or The Kingsman. Either way, its bound to allow for some fun genre scoring for the composer. Barely Lethal falls in the middle here with aiming for a PG-13 rating and going the opposite route. Instead of a young teen becoming a secret agent or superhero, we have one who just wants to be a normal girl. So pretty much what the target demographic already is. The score by Mateo Messina is what youd expect, and has to juggle this mess of a film by blending techno spy sounds with boy drama at homecoming. Dont hold your breath.The first half of the album is actually pretty interesting at times. If the score does one thing, its that it creates a personality for the film. It has a hint of a retro vibe to the sound, but all in all feels like its trying really hard to capture the personality of Henry Jackmans Big Hero 6 at times. The jumbled percussion and electronic hits get in the way of anything interesting happening, and by the time we hit the halfway mark it switches over to a high school comedy score. Maybe its just the very pink cover art, but I swear the music just sounds pink at times. It tries so hard to be this poppy personality of our stereotypical teen girl protagonist that it just becomes style over substance. The short track times dont help it congeal into anything substantial, and the music really only works in bursts. The score never builds to anything and really doesnt feel connected as a narrative at all.In the end the score is just a colorful burst of stylistic music that fails to do much of anything. You got some spy stuff going on and then you got some teen drama going on. It has a personality, but its a dull one. There is no story being told and no narrative momentum. Weve seen Agent Cody Banks, weve seen Spy Kids and weve seen Kick-Ass. Theres no need for this DirecTV made genre dud, and the score just cant manage to get anything going besides the expected spy-infused fluff.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B3991O5H1L9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQXWFL4#wasThisHelpful","R3B3991O5H1L9T","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes all you need is a good shot of nostalgia, and this release definitely will give it to you. A Boy Named Charlie Brown was the first feature length film for the Peanuts gang, all the way back in 1969. Now, dont confuse this with the 1964 TV documentary about Charles M. Schulz that went by the same name. Of course composer Vince Guaraldi is the name most associated with all the Peanuts shorts, and he did in fact compose the score featured in this film. This album focuses on the songs written and performed by Rod McKuen, which also has some instrumental pieces by McKuen. So if youre looking for a great nostalgic trip of jazzy songs and score then this is a fantastic album.McKuens raspy voice softly delivers the lyrics of these great songs that became such a unique approach to A Boy Named Charlie Brown. The music is not coming directly from the perspective of the characters, but the lyrics and tone of them directly comment on the emotional state and thoughts of the Peanuts gang. Seeing the opening montage of Charlie Brown trying to build a kite and failing time after time with the song A Boy Named Charlie Brown being sung underneath turns something so simple into a great and poignant look at the character. The rest of the songs act in the same way, and provide wonderful little windows into the characters without the characters having to speak or sing. The minimal instrumental pieces in all their jazzy goodness perfectly fit into that classic Peanuts soundscape. And while we dont have any of Vince Guaraldis main score here, Rod McKuens songs and instrumental pieces stand wonderfully on their own.The fact that the characters really live within the lyrics of these songs as well as in some of McKuens jazzy instrumental moments makes this a wonderful album to reflect on. A Boy Named Charlie Brown was the first Peanuts feature, and to have these wonderful jazzy songs stand on their own is a real treat. We dont have any of Vince Guaraldis main score, but Rod McKuens raspy jazz ballads punctuated with his few moments of instrumental score will definitely put a warm smile on your face. Theres a great bunch of tracks here, and a few even feature the talents of Mr. Henry Mancini. While not a score album in a traditional sense, the presentation opens the door into the world of the Peanuts characters and makes for a good flashback before we see the new animated feature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BQY9LHEBDE91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5SUBJQ#wasThisHelpful","R3BQY9LHEBDE91","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If youre looking for a more unique take on a western then look no further than Slow West. The feature debut of Scottish director John Maclean is about a young Scottish teen who travels to the American west to find the woman he loves. There he meets a strange vagabond who acts as his guide. The score is by Jed Kurzel who did last years horror hit The Babadook as well as The Snowtown Murders. The score is a great accompaniment that helps give the characters and the film its personality, which definitely carries a bit of a quirky tone.Slow Wests CD presentation mixes dialogue in with the score and source tracks, which I never really cared for. But if you look past the album presentation and focus on the music, youll find a really fresh take in this character-based western. Kurzel crafts a couple of themes here that help the choppy nature of the musical approach. With short tracks, the score sort of peaks in and does a fine job at being the connective tissue that holds this journey together. A mixture of native chants and some source songs fit nicely into the fold to flesh out and add textures. While it all flows surprisingly well, the emotional draw is a bit limited. The score sort of acts in the moment versus building arcs and such, but in the end it all does work for a decent and fresh outing.Slow West gives us a fresh and unique take on the western score. Jed Kurzels music focuses on building atmosphere and tone with pockets of score versus a more flowing narrative, but it works surprisingly well. The weaving of native chants and source songs help bring the world of Slow West to life as well. Its all in all a score worth exploring, especially as a take on the western genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R221BJ715GUI4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQFDFSA#wasThisHelpful","R221BJ715GUI4G","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Director Andrew Niccol hasnt been known to stick with a composer even though he had Antonio Pinto score two of his films. For Good Kill we have Christophe Beck behind the music, and the result is an effective and very subtle scoring effort. Good Kill focuses on a pilot whose job now is to man drones from a base in Las Vegas. He as an internal struggle with killing enemies like they were bad guys in a video game from the safety of his home. The score by Beck does an admirable job echoing the internal struggle even if it's not completely original.The score for Good Kill takes a much more internal and reflective approach. Beck focuses on using tones and atmospheric strings that quietly echo the emotional and existential crisis of our main character. The music can be a bit shapeless at times, but when the melodies peek through we do get moments of tension that are then juxtaposed with reflective moments of tranquility. Its a nice nuanced switch between drone warfare and home life. There is a nice shimmering theme that makes an appearance throughout those moments of tranquil reflection, and to me that was the anchoring point of the score. Especially when we close out with it. The tension stuff thats there is there because it needs to be. This is a quiet war movie, so it couldnt be too loud or bold. But it also makes it pretty standard and not very tense. I cant imagine it was easy trying to score warfare seen through a computer screen, which is why the character-based pieces are much more interesting.Good Kill is a fine examination of drone warfare and the moral and psychological dilemma it puts on soldiers who are instructed to kill other human beings with the click of a button from a desk. The score is low-key and subtle in its approach with a pretty decent theme at the heart of it. The suspense writing isnt all that effective, but it's there because it needs to be. Beck provides some interesting internal and reflective scoring here that is well worth a listen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9SF7KB9WAYXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBY4U2K#wasThisHelpful","R9SF7KB9WAYXE","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Film is a way for us to explore every aspect of our own humanity, and not everything is fairy tales and rainbows. I once asked someone if they watched True Detective when season 1 was airing. They said no, reasoning that there is enough rape and murder in reality so why would anyone want to watch that on TV. I understand it, I dont agree with it. Exploring the darker sides of humanity is important and I feel the more you explore then the more you understand and form your own understandings. Such is the case with Animals, which explores a couple in love who slowly descend into a life of drug addiction. I found the score by Ian Hultquist to be something special here in that it really does a great job at humanizing people that most people see as scum and degenerates.The score for Animals is so simple yet hits the characters with precision. Now even if the film had a large budget and wasnt a small independent feature, I still think this approach would be perfect. The acoustic guitar is used for the music that accompanies the true Bobbie and Jude (our protagonists). This acoustic guitar is an analog instrument, its alive, its true and its not being masked or diffused. Once our characters slip into darkness we are introduced to an electronic trancelike transition point. This perfectly represent the euphoria of drug use, that escape that people seek. This of course then transitions into a darker more dreary electronic soundscape. At this point our characters are in the hell they created for themselves, and musically it's built around them as we travel through their journey to get back to their true selves. We finish back with guitars and euphoria at the end signaling a transformation. Now you may knock a score that only totals 16-minutes, but rest assured that it feels complete. Songs populate the rest of the soundtrack and are used within the film to weave with the score, but the fact that the score is a complete narrative makes it very effective.The gentle strumming of an acoustic guitar introduces us to our loving couple before an electronic wash of despair and hopelessness consumes them in this story of addiction. While addiction is something we as a society seem to associate with inferior beings, Animals attempts to humanize and understand people in this situation. Ian Hultquists simple yet effective score achieves this through a gentle and nuanced approach.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34D0SRIXOMH3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJB5Q0W#wasThisHelpful","R34D0SRIXOMH3F","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Orphan Black is the successful show about a woman who discovers that she has been cloned and many different versions of her are living their own different lives. The sci-fi show has completed 3 seasons and #4 is coming next year. Usually shows that dont feature a lot of score for separate season releases will compile one album for several seasons. As is the case here and with something like Orange Is The New Black. Trevor Yuiles electronic and tonal score has some standout moments, but its mostly there to punctuate and not really support. It has a unique soundscape, but unfortunately emphasizes too much on style to have any organic substance.Its probably important to note that the show has two separate albums being released at the same time, one is songs and one is score. And they are meant to be companion albums as the show relies heavily on songs as it does score. However focusing merely on the score of the show, it does a great job of crafting a soundscape. With all the electronic textures and subtle melodies woven through them, there is a definite flavor to the score. However I was never really absorbed by that flavor. The subtle melodies really never take hold, and the score never forms any dramatic builds besides obviously the last 7-min track. Some of the tracks feel a little jumbled and chaotic, and you dont feel a narrative flow. Then there is the case of Cosima's Treatment, which is a clear rip of Mychael Danna & Devotchkas The Winner Is from Little Miss Sunshine. In the end youll find some pockets of interesting things, but as a whole its missing an emotional connection. The melodies are not aesthetically appealing either, leaving it hard to grasp onto much.Orphan Black has a cool soundscape, but theres not much going on within it. For a show about clones and human identity there is not much of an emotional connection in the music. From the melodic structure down to the pacing and flow, there seems to be a gap. The score is definitely a case of style over substance, but there are a few pockets of interesting moments here that give Orphan Black a unique feel. Otherwise theres not much here that will leave a lasting impression.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F4QXT0H6VZH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X51B4A6#wasThisHelpful","R2F4QXT0H6VZH4","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Supernova is a free-to-play MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena), which is a sub genre of strategy games. Meaning its less about linear storylines and gameplay and more about strategic tactical gameplay. One would think that games like this wouldnt allow for great game scoring, but on the contrary it really gives the composer a blank canvas to create whatever he/she wants. Since there is no structure or pacing to conform to, it really is about building worlds. French composer Olivier Derivire has very quickly dominated the video game landscape with his orchestral-driven thematic writing. Here he his given a very great blank canvass to build a sort of conceptual score for Supernova. His idea is to create a musical journey from the birth of a star all the way to its death by supernova. So with volume 1, he sets the groundwork for what is hopefully bigger and better things to come.Through The Portal is a great establishing album to this game. Olivier Derivire blends his orchestral sound with genre-specific electronics to craft a science fiction soundscape. While there are some connecting motifs, there wasnt exactly a standout theme that was easy to grasp too. I found the first part of the album to be quite entrancing and beautiful at times. Derivire seemed to be channeling his inner Jerry Goldsmith in some tracks to truly create music that felt organic and alive. As we progress the tracks take the shape of generic action stuff that is meant to act in the background of the gameplay. And since the music is servicing the game, the tracks dont fully build into something more climactic. Once we get to The Heroes near the end, we do get to hear some more structured epic builds that Derivire is known for. If this was a standalone album, then one could argue its weakness and feeling of incompleteness. But since this is only the beginning of a bigger saga, its actually a great appetizer. The groundwork has been laid down for hopefully grander arcs, more textured soundscapes and hopefully longer tracks (non here break the 3-minute mark). But as a warm-up, there is plenty to dig into here.Supernova- Volume 1: Through The Portal is a great chapter 1 to Olivier Derivires conceptual score to the MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game. The strategy game gave him a great canvas to work off of for this score that supports the unstructured gameplay, but also is telling the story of the birth and death of a star. There are some great orchestral and electronic textures at work here for this science fiction soundscape. Volume 1 lays down the groundwork for more to come, so any feeling of incompleteness will hopefully be fulfilled in grander entries to come down the line.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ3TTGBOU7OL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDWTZV6#wasThisHelpful","RJ3TTGBOU7OL3","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many people take certain liberties for granted. As a species, we have some wonderful cultural forms of expression that are unique to us. Desert Dancer follows the story of real-life dancer Afshin Ghaffarian and his quest to express his freedom and start an underground dance movement amidst the political turmoil of Iran in 2009. Dancing in Iran is against the law. As recently as last September, a group of people were arrested in Iran for creating an homage video to Pharrells ""Happy"". Islamic law prohibits dancing with members of the opposite sex and women from appearing without a headscarf. So if convicted one could potentially spend a year in prison and up to 90 lashes. Yes, this was 2014. Just a few months ago. The film Desert Dancer comes at a welcomed time, as not only is it a human story but a statement of artistic freedom against the oppressing laws of government run by religion. The simply amazing Benjamin Wallfisch provides a deeply resonating score that echoes the films themes of yearning for creative and spiritual freedom.Desert Dancer, with all its great intentions, will tread into melodramatic territory. Very much like Wallfischs other recent score to Bhopal: A Prayer For Rain. What Wallfisch does though is make sure his music isnt the melodramatic factor, and with great talent he succeeds in crafting a deeply emotional score. By having the score remain relatively slow and somber, the emotions swell from a lower starting point. So, as the arcs grow we can work to these amazingly elegant swells. The reflection of character is also very strong, as we open with our protagonists main theme. The score is unique in that the music is not accompanying the dancing directly. There is one cue where Wallfisch goes to town with some amazing percussion for the track Desert Dancer, and that track is clearly meant to accompany a scene featuring dancing. But overall, this is a score meant to create this somber yearning for freedom. The music feels as if it has grown up in a world of oppression, it feels like it wants to be bigger and more open. Wallfisch opens it up towards the end so that in a sense we finally move from the shadows to the feel the warmth of the sun shining on our faces. All in all, its such a rich and moving experience.Desert Dancer is more proof (if you actually needed it) that Benjamin Wallfisch is a supreme talent with musical storytelling. When you listen to his scores, you can truly tell that this man has found his calling card in life. He is meant to write film music. I really hope he gets the opportunities he deserves, because I would love to see him compose something in the realm of Out Of Africa. He has that raw talent and emotional understanding that connects us as listeners to the story. Im not saying hes the next John Barry yet. But his subtle approach for something like Desert Dancer shows that he deserves big canvasses to work on. Desert Dancer is another fine notch on his filmography, and is truly a uniquely resonating score. Its one of the best hes had to offer in his still early career as a composer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MRCN94IZ8Q2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U25DHYE#wasThisHelpful","R1MRCN94IZ8Q2","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Battlefield series has always been pushing to be the modern and rockstar FPS that focuses more on gameplay instead of story. While Call Of Duty continues to drive the path of epic action warfare, Battlefield decided to change things up a bit with Battlefield: Hardline. Hardline plays out more like a Michael Bay version of CSI: Miami. In essence the game is a hardcore version of cops and robbers. Composer Paul Leonard-Morgan has demonstrated hes a master at electronic soundscapes with his fantastic scores to films like Limitless and Dredd. Here he lays on the rock thick and heavy for an unapologetic electronic jam session that fuels the over the top and fun action of the gameplay.Battlefield: Hardline had a lukewarm reception from gamers and critics. The experiment to do something different didnt necessarily do something memorable. Its the same Battlefield experience with a different gloss of paint. The rock score from Leonard-Morgan does an admirable job at filling the air. It provides the propulsive action and testosterone one would expect from a score like this. Despite the purpose of raising adrenaline, the music has some great textures as well. Paul adds some cool southern twang to the Everglades tracks, which give a nice feel. Some of the story-focused tracks have some nice builds to them as well, and it provides a needed break amidst the action-heavy tracks. I feel like the music decidedly stayed away from melodies that provided too much of a hook. In video games, when you have melodic looping, the music can sometimes stand out too much and annoy the hell out of gamers. That shouldnt be an issue here, but even the core thematic material doesnt jump out as strong as it should. Thats the one thing holding it back. Overall though, its a kick-ass ride that offers plenty of fun.Battlefield: Hardline is not a game-changer, nor does it offer up a central storyline with much to offer. Amidst the guns and explosions, Paul Leonard-Morgan found a way to add controlled chaos to the mix. His score does a fine job of focusing you through the game even if the thematic pull is not that strong. The electronic rock approach was a perfect fit, and Leonard-Morgan has tons of fun with it. The score offers up some great textures and builds for a fun time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PVVTVYCADJEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U4JKGXI#wasThisHelpful","R3PVVTVYCADJEG","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If youre going to do horror, then why not try something new? Right? I mean the genre is so tired and beaten that nothing really impresses anymore. Found footage and ghost flicks flood the theaters every few months, so something like It Follows is such a welcome breath of fresh air. It Follows may be heavy on homage, but its own unique take on character-driven horror makes it special. It also features one of the more unique horror scores youre likely to hear. Disasterpeace is not some new-age band, but actually an intriguing young composer named Rich Vreeland. The name comes from the idea of Masterpiece but flipped on its head. The score that he composes here is a trip to be sure. It Follows is a surprisingly melodic horror score that is fully electronic and embraces grit and digital noise like no other.What struck me about It Follows was how the music balanced sheer terror techniques with more of the melodic approach. Horror scores usually fall into either pure dissonant ambience, over the top scare tactics, or melodic arcs that only build character and have no atmosphere. It Follows managed to blend all of that stuff together, as well as make it sonically unique. The sonic style is definitely a throwback to that John Carpenter sound of films like Assault On Precinct 13, but then at times it can also sound more like a synthetic horror nightmare. And thats what it does well. We can go from a melodic build into something purely distressing, and the music does wear you down. This isnt some easy listening you want to toss on while you drive to the beach, but then again Im not one to judge. Anyways, what the music does well is keep you in the moment and never follows in traditional formulaic footsteps. Vreeland is indeed a novice composer, and he told me in our interview (which you can listen to here) that he really isnt too familiar with the horror genre at all. I think that helped him craft something that was more from within, and not based off works in the past.It Follows does something unique in that it doesnt follow closely in the footsteps of horror scores that came before it. The music is a synthetic blend of melodic builds and digital chaos that keeps you anxious and unsettled. Its unique electronic soundscape proves that Disasterpeace establishes a strong voice and sonic style without resorting to formulaic tactics that plague the genre. The music never outright shocks you, but instead crawls under your skin. It also embraces motifs and melody so the score remains focused, and that propells the narrative forward instead of just commenting on whats happening. Im excited to see what projects Vreeland takes on next as something this bold so early in ones career is definitely worthy of attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37KY1JG0LUO0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U897LO6#wasThisHelpful","R37KY1JG0LUO0E","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think the best thing about all our life journeys is that we all go through similar experiences yet each one is new and unique to our own story. So while weve seen the story of a kid befriending an outsider, in this case an alien, it still can be an emotional journey unique to the individuality of the character. Sure theres Lilo & Stitch, E.T., How To Train Your Dragon and many more. But with Home, we have a story for these characters here and now. Composer Lorne Balfe has been on an amazing roll lately. He showed us his animated side with Penguins Of Madagascar, and here Dreamworks has given a more focused and emotionally driven storyline as a canvass. His score finds the emotions and personality from the get go, its a focused narrative that displays a bond of friendship and all that comes with it when you are from two different worlds. Home has personality, uniqueness and heart. Its wonderfully thematic and rich with emotions. This is a fantastic score.Home has no problem finding its unique voice from the start. ""Symphony In Oh"" gives us our central theme and from then on we are on the journey. Balfe keeps the orchestrations light, bouncy and adds just the right amount of percussion for the more action-driven moments. The score brings tons of energy and life, and in these moments we find the personality of the characters and the relationship. We feel it build as the adventure progresses. Within the films narrative, Balfes score shares some space with songs from the band Stargate. In whats probably some weird legal thing, Stargate shares music credit on the film and therefore their name is on the cover even though they didnt have a hand in the score. There is a separate song album, and what we have here is all Balfe. With that being said, Balfes score does have to fight against what is not considered top tier Dreamworks. Home as a film is no where near the storytelling power of something like How To Train Your Dragon, and of course this is no fault to Balfe. However, Lorne does successfully find the emotional heart of the film with the 40min of score we have here, and makes us emotionally invested for the entirety of the journey. The score is not all bounce and energy. There is a subtlety and emotional nuance within the thematic variations for those gentler moments. The score becomes its own beautiful creation. If you need to draw comparison one can always look at John Powells Mars Needs Moms, which is another masterful score to a not so masterful film. Home's music is a beautiful testament to the characters and their story, but unfortunately the film itself as a whole falls short. That doesn't stop the score from still being able to find and hit all the beats it needed to hit.Lorne puts on display some of his most emotionally in-touch thematic work to date here. Its a focused narrative that aims right on the emotional connection between our two main characters. He instills the fun and bounce one would expect from a brightly colored Dreamworks flick, but dont underestimate the power of where the score will take you. By the end you will be fully invested as the music's beautiful thematic variations draw every ounce of emotion out. It provides fun adventure and subtle heart. I found this score to feel very personal. He never makes the emotional current too large or over the top because the relationship of the characters is so unique to them. The adventure itself has some great swells, and thats where the score brings the fun and excitement. It's beautiful at times and the thematic stricture is on point. Home is some of Lornes most impressive writing because it was born from the characters and not the wacky adventure they go on. The film may fall short, but the score itself is a heartfelt delight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EPOLXUW26MLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJTKOFW#wasThisHelpful","R1EPOLXUW26MLW","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ori And The Blind Forest is a new platforming game that beautifully encompasses the player in a fantasy world wrapped around an emotional story. The visuals and gameplay are stunning and if you find yourself being whisked away to some fantasy world by the music, you should see it paired with the gameplay. Games like this are supremely focused on gameplay, as it becomes an integral part of the structure. Gareth Coker was tasked at building an immense score to not only bring the worlds of the blind forest to life, but bring emotional resonance to the story and characters. He succeeds greatly with a score that's wondrous, magical, beautiful, exciting and full of life.Ori And The Blind Forest opens with the central theme as the story begins. The storys protagonist is a forest spirit whose life begins with a great tragedy, this propels him to find his purpose within the world that surrounds him. Coker does a wonderful job gently delivering some heavy emotions right from the get go. This gives our narrative an emotional weight to build from as Oris extensive journey lays ahead. Speaking of Journey, many may feel compelled to compare both the game and the score to Journey. Journey is a masterpiece, I will say that, of both score and game. However, what we have here is a 9-hour platformer that immerses us in a lush and complex world. Journey was a 2.5 hour game that embraced more of a simple and streamlined approach to emotions and gameplay. Both are wonderful in their own rights. The score here in its entirety is the embodiment of a beautiful fairytale adventure, of a personal journey of discovery. The music does its duties to make each different area feel unique while still keeping the central core of the character at the forefront. So instead of musical ideas such as Level 1 theme/Level 2 theme, we have Ori in Level 1/Ori in Level 2. It makes the score that much more accessible and a better storytelling tool than traditional platforming scores. With that being said, there may some disconnect and its hard to keep the grand picture in scope through the journey at times. The score has to sustain a long journey through various different levels, and its inevitable that some pacing issues in the narrative would have to make way for the gameplay. However, its a minuscule structural thing that doesn't really take away from the grand awe of the score by the time we reach its emotional end. Once the score sets into the final act, the listener will be filled with rushes of emotions as Coker brings everything full circle in a truly breathtaking fashion.Ori And The Blind Forest is a tremendous effort from Gareth Coker. He managed to build a beautiful story through a strong central theme that traverses a rich and living world. Oris journey becomes our journey, and the music brings everything to life in the game. There is no dialogue, just sporadic narration in a fictional language. So the music here carries everything. While some slight structural clunkiness occurs, its not enough to stop the power of this score. The music will wash over you and sweep you away on one of the more memorable journeys you will take. Dont skip over Ori And The Blind Forest; its something that will touch gamers and non-gamers alike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K93HU516KB8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TR9P0FA#wasThisHelpful","R2K93HU516KB8F","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Child 44 is based of the first of a trilogy of Soviet-era novels from author Tom Rob Smith. Child 44 is a drama/mystery about a pro-Stalin officer who loses his status and credibility when he suggest a serial murderer is killing children. By suggesting murder in the Soviet Union, it would show a weakness in the regime and discredit the police force. So our protagonist takes it upon himself to find the culprit when he is stripped of his official status. Swedish composer Jon Ekstrand reunites with his Easy Money director Daniel Espinosa on Child 44. The result is a somber yet absorbing score that does an admirable job of pulling the listener into the narrative.The score starts off somber and soft as it builds this portrait of Soviet Russia. It does a great job of setting the premise up and sending us on our way. The music focuses a lot on establishing mood and atmosphere by using deep heavy strings and piano. As we twirl deeper down the rabbit hole and get tangled up in the mystery, the music is not afraid to bring aggression. There are bursts of rage that poke through the fabric of the score, and it adds this effective gravitas to it. There are a handful or propulsive action tracks that bring the adrenaline level up as well. These moments sort of juxtapose with the structure of the rest of the score, and upon re-listening to them it feels like they lay it on a bit too heavy than what is needed. The music does devolve a bit into a ""trace the path of the plot"" type of feel. At times you feel like a pencil is dragging a line through a maze, and every unseen twist and turn is scored as such. But the overall mood and atmosphere keep the score afloat. In the end we have a drama/mystery that is successful in the world it built sonically, but holds our hands a little too much throughout.Child 44 is a decent scoring attempt from Jon Ekstrand. It never shies away from being aggressive when needed, and does a wonderful job at crafting the atmosphere of the film. Character and emotional resonance are a bit distant due to melodic material that doesnt stick too well. And the music at times feels like its tracing the outline of the plot on a sheet of paper, which ends up having moments that feel rigid. But as a whole its a score that feels alive, and the music will immerse you for this twisty fictional Soviet-era mystery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C333H4RKMPAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VG3O7XG#wasThisHelpful","R3C333H4RKMPAR","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In what is one of the more headline nabbing soundtracks of year, always leave it to Marvel to cause some film music drama. Brian Tyler has been Marvels go-to composer for a while now, and has done some rather impressive work for Marvel. Iron Man 3s score was a superb orchestral action score, while Thor: The Dark World was a satisfactory if maybe a little generic take. Brian even composed the Marvel fanfare that opens every film. So what exactly happened on Age Of Ultron? Where did Danny Elfman come from at the last second? Whatever the reasoning is, this hybrid score ended up working out better than one would expect. Its a vast improvement over Silvestris subdued effort, and Elfman does an admirable job at filling in the gaps to Tylers bravado.Okay, so heres the story according to my speculation. Brian was signed on to do Furious 7 and Avengers: Age Of Ultron, but when it came to scheduling it seems like the two films would be at the scoring point closer together than realized. Simply put, the workload was a bit much for Tyler to handle, and another composer had to be brought in to patch up the missing pieces. Danny Elfmans named popped up as an additional composer on the billing block of the final poster, but then rumblings were afoot that Dannys role had grown. My guess was that they needed Dannys role to expand to create a natural ebb and flow instead of it being a patch job. So what is the result?The result is a decent orchestral action score done in full adventurous flair. To be honest though, its not terribly different in structure and elements from Silvestris. Which can be seen as a good thing I suppose. Tyler embraces his past thematic work for Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, while both Tyler and Elfman quote Silvestris theme throughout. I know continuity is a big goal for Tyler, which is what he was trying to bring to the Marvel universe. Thematic continuity does come to a fruition here, even if I found the dramatic builds to the thematic flourishes a bit lacking. Then you have another problem that arises in that you have Silvestris theme and this predicament. Should you reference Silvestris main theme boldly and unashamedly? Or should Tyler and Elfman focus on not leaning too much on it? They seem to be somewhere caught in the middle. Then one would ask, why not just ask Alan Silvestri to come back if the first film's main theme will be the center of attention? If Marvels business politics were that simple then maybe he would be back, but thats a conversation for another place and time.As you move through the album you can tell that Elfman is trying to mold his sound to Tylers soundscape, and he succeeds mostly. I mean, he cant hide his musical voice. Danny Elfman is one of the most unique auteurs in the business and Tyler is one as well. But luckily they do not clash. Elfman provides some great character moments that help round the rough wandering edges. Not all the emotional beats stick though, which has always been a problem for Marvel. The material never lends itself to emotionality in that their characters are meant to be watched, and not really related to. Audiences want to see what the characters will do or say more than they project themselves into the narrative, which is an issue that no composer can fix. So, the score tries to be as big and bold as it can be. By the end of it all, its a fun ride for sure.As youll notice on the album cover, there is no And/& between Brian Tyler and Danny Elfmans names. While Elfman has elevated himself to co-composer credit, the two didnt write hand in hand together. This more unique collaboration had Elfman come in late in the game to finish the job due to bad timing with Brians schedule with Furious 7. The end result works. Its a boisterous and bold action score done in that classic orchestral fashion. I do think it suffers from an orchestral wash of sound from time to time, or in other words the score doesnt have a desired graspable shape. Themes and variations provide great continuity, especially since Brian Tyler has composed for 2 of the characters in the Avengers before. Silvestris theme gets some good milage here, so much so that it begs the question of what went wrong that Silvestri didnt come back. But in the end, I appreciate fully what Brian has been trying to do with his Marvel scores by bringing that old orchestral adventure spirit back. Theres plenty to admire here, and plenty of flourishing thrills to be had even though at the end of the day all the creative work on a Marvel film is meant to serve the studio vision of the franchise. As a piece of summer escapism, theres plenty to enjoy even though scores like Iron Man 3 or Captain America: The Winter Solider are way more memorable and impactful. I expect Henry Jackman to take over given the Russo brothers are directing the Infinity War Parts 1 & 2, so we shall see where the Marvel musical snowball will roll next.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A2N6PIH99BX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHJ7DWW#wasThisHelpful","R3A2N6PIH99BX0","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blackwood is your traditional ghost story thriller that follows a family moving into a creepy countryside home, and of course there is a history and things start going bump in the night. I was intrigued to see how Lorne was going to handle something in this genre and was pleasantly surprised that he approached it with melody and structure over ambience and dissonance. The score is effective at adding a menacing uneasiness, but also executed with a gentle touch that makes the whole thing fragile and therefore very accessible.Blackwood feels more like a character journey that ends with a revelation instead of your traditional lets try and scare the crap out of you type of score. Lorne starts us off with a wonderful main theme that he uses throughout the score. The score is heavily anchored with that theme plus some great melodic structures, and that makes it very accessible for the audience. We are placed in the footsteps of the characters and the narrative that way. Lorne employs some chilling builds and uneasiness techniques to build that mysterious ghostly atmosphere. There always seems to be something bubbling under the surface, and it feels the music is always about to pull the sheet off the secret revelation but youre not sure if you want to see whats under there. The score works with big broad strokes, the meaty track times really allow the score to do its job. By the end of it, you feel a definite resolution and a completion to the eerie journey. At times I didn't feel completely emotionally invested, but I was invested in the story from start to end. You dont feel beaten or abused by the music, and that makes it a journey you feel eager to take again.Blackwood is a simple yet effectively eerie ghost story score that does a great job at building atmosphere around a strong central theme. You feel like you are walking the same path as the characters instead of just bearing witness to the events. Lorne never bashes you or assaults you with the music, which I never found to be an effective way to scare the audience anyway. Instead he uses effective builds and tension techniques to heighten the thrills without resulting to formulaic tactics. Blackwood always remains more of a mysterious secret being uncovered rather than a full-on horror plot. The music makes you eager to find out the truth, even if the journey to that revelation is chilling and eerie. Lornes light-handed touch here makes the score work very well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J7GFXBRZTZHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRJ6JYE#wasThisHelpful","R1J7GFXBRZTZHP","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lorne Balfe has proven to be a masterful documentary composer with many of them under his belt so far. He brings a human and emotional touch to his doc scores that never make them feel like doc scores. This continues with Manny, and his score stands out here because the score is so focused from the POV of Manny Pacquiao that it instantly becomes an emotional portrait of a rags to riches story with all the varying complexities that come with that kind of success.Mannys journey from growing up poor in the Philippines to becoming one of the most successful boxers in the history of the sport is a story the whole world connects to. It also helps that hes likable, never cocky and always caring towards others. Lorne helps us go on Mannys journey from his impoverished childhood to having the whole world watch him in the ring. The score becomes very personal, and I think that happens through the instrumentation here. It doesnt feel like generic filler or generic sounding. In fact its quite emotional and very touching. We literally start from the ground and work up. From the gentle plucking of a guitar to a more jazzy scene filled with ethnic percussion, the score carries its unique voice that is shaped around Manny as a person. Lorne does a fantastic job of shaping the bustling and growing aspects of Mannys life beyond boxing as well. Pacquiao literally becomes a spokesman and role model for his home country and people, and it places this newfound responsibility on his shoulders. The music shows us how he accepts all this, it places an emotional stamp on moments in his life. When the score needs to build for that fighting spirit, it never feels hokey or forced. We get a surmounting rush and feel the energy, but we never lose the intimate nature of the music. I think the genuine nature of Manny Pacquiao as a human being lent itself to allow Lorne to craft one of his more emotionally rooted scores here. This isnt some boxing documentary with that fighting spirit. I was very surprised to find gorgeous music that I really connected with. This is a real life human journey that we take through this music. Its a simple and effective portrait of man who is excelling in what he does best, and being the best person he can be.Manny is not a boxing score full of bravado and triumph. Its a gorgeously executed portrait of rising from nothing and building character through extraordinary circumstances. Lorne has painted a wonderful journey of Pacquiaos path from poverty to greatness, and all the complexities and responsibilities that he needed to shoulder as his success grew. Instead of making him seem like Superman, Lorne lets us into the fragility and emotionality of Manny as a human being. As a portrait of a human journey we can all relate to, its an emotionally resonant story that deserves your attention. It also proves how Balfe as a composer can craft a score that opens a window into a person instead of a life that most of us probably wouldnt be able to relate to. Whether or not the documentary itself can be seen as a glorified PR piece or not doesn't negate how effective the score is within it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRBKUA8CCK3T8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBHAH30#wasThisHelpful","RRBKUA8CCK3T8","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Martin Tillman and Satnam Ramgotra are two names you might recognize if youre a fan of Hans Zimmers work. Martin is one of the best cellists around, and Hans uses him as a soloist on many of his scores. Stuff like the Jokers theme and the bellowing cello of The Ring were performed and perfected by Martin. Satnam is an amazing percussionist who most notably performed on Zimmers Inception score. The intense percussion on tracks like Mombasa can be credited to Satnams skills. Here the two combine as composers for the stylish sword epic, Last Knights. You sometimes wonder how actors of Clive Owen and Morgan Freemans caliber take on projects that are hellbent on straight to video quality of writing and execution. Last Knights is quite the awful little film here, I mean the title even sounds like something I would come up with in middle school. Anyway, I was hoping that the plot and genre of the picture would lend itself to some boldly heroic music. Because there are plenty of bad films with decent scores holding them together the best they can. Unfortunately, the score lacks any real shape or structure to give us something worthy.If you were expecting something like Gladiator or King Arthur then you can keep on moving, because you wont find that here. The score more or less is a wash of sound that decides that brooding undertones is the best way to approach it from start to finish. The music never takes any shape, we never get any themes or melodic structures. Its as if someone set up a keyboard synthesizer and just decided to hold down 4-5 keys at a time, then change them every 30 seconds or so. The only real shape the score takes is from Ramgotras percussion, which is featured in some standout tracks. Its not till track 13 that we actually get some melodic builds. And its not that the music didnt have the stage to do what it needed to do, I mean the album consists of 54-minutes of music. I would say only a few of the tracks near the end do something to pull the audience into the narrative, and its not by much. There is clearly some Zimmeresque structures going on, but they dont click. The score never feels like anything but brooding washes of synth soundscapes. The percussion is the saving grace and makes the score listenable. The final act delivers some moments worth checking out, but in the overall view of the narrative it doesnt do much.Last Knights is not the bold and exciting score one would hope for coming from two esteemed musicians from the Remote Control Productions family. It lacks any momentum or narrative pull, and instead decides to go with the lumbering and brooding synth soundscape from start to finish. Ramgotras percussion makes an appearance in a few tracks, and those are the more noteworthy ones because it actually adds shape and structure. We get a few standard epic moments toward the end that try to be very Zimmeresque, but they lack the execution needed to actually work within the narrative. While the score is listenable and worthy of a one-time listen, its not one that will impress or stick with you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UY0WU8VNZ9MR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3PPQIG#wasThisHelpful","R1UY0WU8VNZ9MR","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Disneynature films have become an Earth Day tradition and are wonderful experiences for viewers of all ages to explore the natural world around us. The series usually sees a different composer on each film, with only Nicholas Hooper being one who composed two of the Disneynature films. For Monkey Kingdom we get a refreshing return from a composer who I consider one of my favorites, Mr. Harry Gregson-Williams. Harry has been slowly entering back into a regular routine after his sabbatical, and hearing the orchestral side of Harry for the first time in a while is a true delight.The Disneynature films usually try and craft a story of animals lives in their natural habitat. Here we have the story of Maya and her newborn as they struggle to live within the social hierarchy of her group. Harry delivers a delicate and personable score that is the perfect accompaniment to a narrative where the protagonists dont speak. Maya gets a wonderful theme that follows her throughout the score. It reminds me a bit of Harrys work on Narnia, and here it becomes this source of life for Maya the caring mother. The score does some mickey-mousing as its necessary in a documentary like this. There is some light-hearted goofiness in the beginning, but once Maya is introduced the score matures. In fact it becomes more focused and matured as it moves along. This is not a bouncy kids score. Harry really crafts a journey with the music. When things become threatening such as the presence of a Jaguar or another group of monkeys coming to overtake territory, the music reflects that. I loved how emotionally invested it got me in the story. I was able to connect to the struggles, and it gives those moments of lightness a feeling of appreciation of life. To see, witness and connect with living creatures struggling and then enjoying life, its something special that connects us all. The score succeeds in making that connection. The final moments such as Retaking The Rock are actually quite thrilling, and of course we end with Mayas theme that completes the journey.Monkey Kingdom is not a documentary score in the sense that its just scoring moments in nature. Harry is crafting a genuine narrative that is poignant, touching, fun and at times thrilling. No matter what emotions are being evoked, its an engaging listen. Pacing and flow may be more choppy than a score for a fictional narrative, but its because we do have these little moments that pierce out and stand on their own. Harry even does a little spy homage for the track Market Raid. Its the light-hearted stuff that is necessary in a narrative-based nature doc like this, that may interrupt the more deeper emotional flow. But in the end, once we arrive at our conclusion, youll have a warm smile on your face as the score slowly winds down with that gentle and beautiful theme.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIOONJ0SQXPUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VY0VBJ4#wasThisHelpful","RIOONJ0SQXPUB","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rob Simonsen has mostly been getting noticed in the independent film circuit where he has demonstrated not only this thematic writing, but his ability to focus on and flesh out emotional arcs. His scores are always in-tune with the characters journey and thats where the music is born. His scores for The Spectacular Now, The Way Way Back, Wish I Was Here and Foxcatcher carry his unique voice as a composer but also his ability to extract emotion with little effort. Of course Foxcatcher stands out as a different type of emotional resonance, while the others feel more related to one another. The Age Of Adaline is an exploration of mortality and love, as Adaline suffers a freak accident which freezes her aging process and essentially lets her live forever. Simonsens score is so in-tune with the emotional fragility of the narrative, while adding the ever so slight hint of a fairy tale romance.The score opens with our introduction to our main protagonist, and the music really is completely from her point of view. This makes the score very intimate and easy to fall into its embrace. There is a coldness and an emptiness to the music that echoes the idea of yearning or incompleteness. When character relationships build and progress you will notice the music become much warmer and fleshed out. We can feel when Adaline is happy and we can feel when shes scared or shes sad. And I know that may seem obvious since its the job of the score to externalize the characters emotions, but to see it done so elegantly makes it stand out. Since the film tries to be this fantasy romance in the vein of something like Big Fish or The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, you will see the music fall into some of those slow lumbering romantic swells. Those moments do provide some much needed flourishes, but not enough to elevate the score into something more commanding. We sort of keep circling this state of fragile yearning, that when those boisterous orchestral flourishes do come they feel sudden. There are beautiful moments in this score, but the flow from introspective character drama to romantic fantasy takes some missteps in crafting an emotional current that truly starts at the beginning and climaxes in the final act.The Age Of Adaline is a score that is wonderfully executed and is beautiful at times. Its in the narrative build that it loses some of the momentum that is needed to make the impact of the final act stick. The score works best as an internal exploration of a woman who is in conflict with her state of immortality, and not so much as a sweeping romantic fantasy. But in the journey there is much to admire, including the great Rob Simonsen getting to explore new areas musically. He proves to have the talents and uniqueness of other composers I see him similar to such as James Newton Howard and Alexandre Desplat. And he shows glimmers of greatness here for sure, he just needed a better canvass to structure around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GOXZ84GT690U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VU2KUIE#wasThisHelpful","R1GOXZ84GT690U","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Rodriguez blew up in popularity after the debut of his Mexican western, Desperado. The sequel and pseudo remake of his low budget El Mariachi immediately cemented his style and voice as a filmmaker in a time where studios allowed auteurs to flourish. His next feature would be a horror western genre mashup that would go on to be a cult hit, and spawn several sequels. From Dusk Till Dawn featured a sharp screenplay from Rodriguezs good friend Quentin Tarantino, and was a balls to the wall fun time. Now fast forward 18 years later. The studios have risen again and most auteur filmmakers have been forced out of filmmaking in favor for studio franchise tentpoles. Instead, auteur filmmakers have found a great home in TV which can be argued to be in some sort of New Wave movement. From Dusk Till Dawn: The Series is a direct adaptation of Rodriguezs original film. It also features the bold stylings of composer Carl Thiel, who is Rodriguezs go-to collaborator.Since Rodriguez is an all in one filmmaker (writer/director/producer/composer/editor/cinematographer), its usually expected that hes involved in all creative roles of his projects. Carl has co-composed some amazing scores with Robert. But here Carl is the sole voice of the series, and this has allowed him to create a really focused soundscape for the show. Youll notice some of the usual hits from Robert Rodriguezs band Chingon, but the body of the score from Thiel does an awesome job of crafting a more atmospheric and textural backdrop to the show. This isnt the normal grindhouse rocking score we heard in stuff like Machete or Planet Terror from Carl (although it carries some elements of it), but its definitely more low key. Thiel does some great builds with rhythms and brings in melodic textures that weave around them. There is definitely a little old school John Carpenter style feel to it at times, which is a great play on the genre. The scores structure definitely allows itself to mold better to the season-long story, and for a TV series the music participates a lot. There are definitely some character nuances that go beyond the stylistic voice of the music. While the lack of bold themes to anchor it down may prove a little disconnecting at first, you will find the score is doing much more under the surface rather than riding on top of it.From Dusk Till Dawn sees Carl Thiel exploring a more rhythmic and subtle melodic approach that creates the sonic world of season 1s narrative to exist in. The lack of strong thematic material makes it harder to grasp at first, but once things get going youll find the score is doing some awesome things that are meant to spread across all 10 episodes of season 1. Thiels bold stylistic voice as a composer gives the shows music an identity, and really pulls you into Rodriguezs gritty Tex-Mex flavored vampire world. The score and the show takes itself a little more seriously than the film its based off of, but theres still plenty of fun to have here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10O2GD8BF8XPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WGZPHUA#wasThisHelpful","R10O2GD8BF8XPR","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The collaboration between Michael Giacchino and Brad Bird has been one of the most creatively rewarding things to be able to witness in filmmaking. The two have been in sync since their first project together, and they show no sign of slowing down. Damon Lindelofs involvement in Tomorrowland as a co-writer and producer only enhances the expectations since Lindelof was one of the showrunners on LOST. And thats where it comes down to, expectations. The trifecta of Bird/Lindelof/Giacchino all on one mysterious science fiction film that even the trailers have yet to fully explain has built up some high expectations. This is where I hope to quell those expectations, and let you know that in order to fully appreciate Tomorrowland youre going to have to go in without the expectations of a grand science fiction opus.Tomorrowland is a unique film in that its much smaller than youd expect. Theres no real giant set pieces, no real massive action and it really is carried on the shoulders of characters and plot revelations. The score here is more of something that operates in the background, which might be surprising given how much Michael's score carried previous Brad Bird films. Giacchino has woven a surprisingly intimate yet curiously stirring commentary to the Tomorrowland narrative. Without giving anything away; the plot revolves around Frank (George Clooney) being exiled from Tomorrowland and now a bright young girl has been mysteriously chosen and brought to Frank in the hopes of convincing him to go back and fix a broken Tomorrowland. The film is really about the unraveling mystery, and the score is there to support that unraveling with a few big flourishing moments along the way.Giacchino does what he does best here, and while it might not feel as inspired as Jupiter Ascending earlier this year its still a wonderful adventure. The theme of the film is that we must encourage the brilliant minds of the world to work together and help pave the path for the future, so the ideas of bubbling intellectual creativity live within the music. The music is more about the mystery and adventure of the journey. Those sequences where the music is intimate with the characters in their journey of disovery is where it shines. The big flourishing moments, which are there, establish that sense of wonderment and excitement. The main theme is pure Giacchino goodness and he uses it to anchor the score throughout. A lot of it reminded me of a much lighter version of Super 8. The ending is wrapped up in this warm blanket of inspiration which leaves you feeling lifted.Tomorrowland stumbles a bit narratively as a film, and that is reflected in the structure of the score. Even though it has some trouble finding its footing at first, by the end weve traveled on an intricate journey full of mystery and wonder that awakens your curiosity. Giacchinos score acts more like the connective tissue of the narrative versus the spine. And since were usually accustomed to Giacchinos music being the spine of a film, it may strike us as different. If you dont go in expecting a giant sweeping science fiction blockbuster then I think youll be surprised at the intimate and inspirational quality of this score (and film). While the big flourishing moments are there, its in the smaller more interesting bridging arcs that the score is worth exploring. The score and the film do have a unique personality to them that make them memorable and special, and if you block out any preconceived expectations that the creative trifecta's previous bodies of work have built, you might be pleasantly surprised.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QCU3NVXKYTVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBBET3O#wasThisHelpful","R1QCU3NVXKYTVL","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Matthew Vaughn immediately demonstrated his abilities as one of the most stylistically driven directors to emerge. From Layer Cake, Stardust, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class and now Kingsman: The Secret Service he has shown his ability to craft entertaining action. The collaboration between Vaughn and Jackman of course began on Kick-Ass, the film famous for having 4 composers. Jackman emerged the winner obviously as he and his collaborator Matthew Margeson went on to co-score Kick-Ass 2 (with Vaughn only producing). Jackman of course scored X-Men: First Class for Vaughn. Now Jackman and Margeson embark together once again under the helm of Matthew Vaughn for Kingsman: The Secret Service. I think what will surprise people the most about this score is not just that its good, but its also a wonderfully lush entry into the spy genre. The score is bold, beautiful and elegant all the while subtly accenting Vaughns visual style.The score is an absorbing spy thriller from start to finish. Youll find that Jackman and Margeson do a fantastic job of setting up themes in the first act, and then carrying them through the narrative build of the score throughout. I was surprised at how reserved the music was at times as it built up to moments and fleshed out characters. I know its easy to compare this to something like James Bond, but it really does carry a lot of the musical archetypes of the genre. Henry and Matts stamps are all over it though, this is in no way a John Barry rip. It holds its own very well. The action is smoothly executed and never clunky or bombastic. There is a fluidity to the music that shines through its orchestration. A little bit of electronic textures exist, but they are used to great effect. The reverb motif heard in Curious Scars And Implants does a great job of crafting uneasiness. There are plenty of moments where the score does some pretty weighty lifting in terms of emotional resonance. It all builds towards the fantastic climactic tracks Calculated Infiltration and Hands On The Machine. When that main theme hits at the peak of a build, you do get chills. The whole score is expertly crafted in terms of narrative structure and overall emotional resonance. The thematic structures are wonderful, and everything about the score pulls you in from the get go.I was very surprised at how much fun I had listening to this score. Jackman and Margeson are a very notable composing duo. What they delivered here is a score that has class, elegance, intensity and adventure. The big action moments work fantastically and always feel organic instead of forced. The quieter character moments spark an emotional resonance and never feel melodramatic. And the thematic work here is top-notch. Kingman: The Secret Service is a a great ride from two amazingly versatile talents.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18K2NTSFO9S1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T76W2ZY#wasThisHelpful","R18K2NTSFO9S1Q","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If there is a will, there is a way. I guess that would be the motto of Universals The Scorpion King spin-off franchise. Believe it or not, we are at #4. The films offer up some stupid fun at the cost of good filmmaking, but luckily some of actions best composers have found themselves on these films. Starting with John Debney, we then saw Klaus Badelt take on #2, Trevor Morris take #3 and now Geoff Zanelli takes a crack at #4. Geoff puts on his best B-movie hat and just has a blast with this score. The music feels born of Pirates Of The Caribbean (which Geoff worked on all 4 films), and plays out like any great adventure score should.Quest For Power will go through the motions of your standard action/adventure movie. Geoff never treats the movie as a joke though, even though he plays off the cheesy nature of it from time to time. He starts off with a great theme and goes from there. He builds off his main theme throughout most of the score, and it results in some great musical set pieces. The tracks are beefy and long, meaning you get to hear Geoff flex his action builds. The score is very easy to compare to Pirates Of The Caribbean, because like that franchise there is an edge of comedy and fun to it while still having an adventurous scope. So we have a waltzy bounce to the music, which helps add some different dimensions from the robust action cues. Surprisingly, Geoff managed to find a way to inject a sense of awe and wonder as well. You wouldnt expect that from a score that suddenly breaks out into an electric guitar solo. The second half of the narrative is much weaker musically than the first, but it doesnt kill the experience. We lose a bit of that thematic momentum entering the third act, but still finish on a strong note.The Scorpion King 4: Quest For Power wont be winning any awards and wont be credited for advancing the art of filmmaking in any direction, but it doesnt mean you cant enjoy it. The movie may be unwatchable, but the score is not unlistenable. This is top-notch Zanelli here. In fact Im just a little bummed that Geoffs musical efforts will be tied down to a direct to video movie. He demonstrates some amazing thematic gravitas here that would be worthy of a swashbuckling adventure with a $200million budget behind it. Dont skip out on this score due to the film, its a nice treat waiting to be discovered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20YFDLL697MCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTXON6I#wasThisHelpful","R20YFDLL697MCE","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can always count on Bear McCreary to deliver a score that is totally unique to the film yet so familiar to his sound. While Everly is a B-movie at best, it seems we have gotten some of Bears most fun work from movies like this (see Knights Of Badassdom). The story of woman whose ex-boyfriend puts a hit out on her while she is in her apartment, is an over the top action romp. She fends off the hoards of bad guys for this generic action flick that comes heavy on the violence and heavy on the closeups of Hayek's derrire. However, leave it to Bear to have some fun with it and deliver a decent score infused with melody and flair.Everly is an electronic based score that works on a fundamental level. Its percussive and displays a forcefully continued momentum. The Japanese percussion and string work adds just a hint of ethnic touches to the music, but it never strays from its propulsive roots. Now, percussion is probably one of McCrearys best assets as a composer. I would hold him next to John Powell in terms of how well he utilizes percussion, and honestly that is the core of this score. There are some songs to add a Christmas flair from Bears brother, Brendan McCreary. As well as Bears wife, Raya Yarbrough. The songs dont mesh that well with what Bear is doing with the score, but provide the juxtaposition needed within the context of the film. Overall the film moves to a somewhat satisfying climax, and Bear delivers it with the 7-min track titled Taiko. Everly is nothing complex and nothing worth extensive analysis, but when Bear gets in his percussive mode it's hard not to dive right in.Everly won't wow you or surprise you. This is a straight-forward action score. Bear delivers the goods and gives us a gritty electronic score that is driven with percussion. A slight Japanese flair finds its wait into the scores quieter moments. The build of it reminded me slightly of Bears score to Dark Void, which I love. The music works best when it just embraces its synth foundation and goes for adrenaline. This is a fun score, and it probably wouldnt have been if Bear was not composing. But since he placed his awesome melodic and percussive stamp on this, it's worth checking out for sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ROBS70V1C68R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW644R0#wasThisHelpful","R3ROBS70V1C68R","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Strategy games are a very interesting media canvass for music because of how unstructured the canvass is. The Civilization series has been a PC gaming staple since 1991 when the first game was released. There have been many entries in this saga, but Beyond Earth takes the turn-based strategy game to a sci-fi realm. The thing is, I dont connect to these games that much, but I love the scores they allow composers to cook up. Cris Velascos Company Of Heroes 2 is an example of how great of a role music can play on this structure. Im happy to say that Beyond Earth is another fantastic example of music knowing no bounds, and resulting in sonic worlds worth getting lost in.Since Beyond Earth is all about building civilizations on different planets, you can imagine the huge blank canvas this group of composers had to work with. While the game has a loose central storyline that defines the events in the game, its mostly gameplay focused instead of narrative. So in this case, musics role is not to craft a narrative or tell a story, but instead to build sonic worlds. Each track is like visiting a different planet or different world. Some tracks are more melodic and structured than others, while some are pure ambient textural builds. The 4 composers divided work based on their stylistic strengths, and together they congeal to form a massively scoped score. With over 2hrs45min of music in this release, you can bet you will have plenty to get lost in. I like that there was a nice selection of epically scoped tracks mixed with tracks meant merely to build simple sonic textures. Overall its an immersive listen that may test your limits of exhaustion if you try to dig through it all in one sitting. This music is meant to be spread across hours upon hours of gameplay. But as a standalone release, it offers some wonderful worlds to discover.Beyond Earth is a giant entity of a score that some may find hard to tame. Dont attempt to take it all in with one sitting. I decided to discover each of the 4 composers separately by listening to their music lumped together. You get a better feel of their strengths and what they are offering to this massive game. That became a wonderfully immersive experience for me. The score is designed to fill the air of a strategy based interface, but on its own becomes this sort of meditative look on the universe. The music truly does feel like its taking you on a cosmic journey, some tracks melodic while other ambient. It may struggle to be continually engaging throughout, but if taken in steps proves to be a worthy experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG2U5NT7HG3PR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OL1EJKQ#wasThisHelpful","RG2U5NT7HG3PR","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Television scoring has taken leaps and bounds over the recent years with the boom of cable TV series. There is still a difference when you look at network television versus cable television when it comes to a dramatic series. A cable series usually has season long arcs with a shortened episode count (i.e. Game Of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Knick). A network series will usually have a higher episode count and a narrative that is in itself more episodic, meaning the episodes are not as tightly contained (i.e. NCIS, Law & Order, Person Of Interest). Chicago Fire falls in that latter group. These types of shows make it really difficult for a composer to craft a traditional score. Its often joked that these are all scored by ominous tones. Thankfully one of the more melodically driven composers out there found himself in the TV market. Atli rvarsson has surprisingly been able to inject emotionally driven and melodically engrossing music into his scores for not just Chicago Fire, but Chicago P.D. as well.Season 2 acts as a great companion album to Season 1. Both albums arent really structured to provide a narrative flow, but Season 2 is more along the lines of that if thats what you were missing. So in short, Season 1 album = melodic action / Season 2 album = character development. This album provides some great builds and textures that fit into the soundscape of the show. I like that we have adequate track times, meaning the score was left to do what a score was meant to do. The fact that music like this can be found on a Dick Wolf produced show is pretty impressive. Atli rvarsson has given Chicago Fire a voice that is beyond just the Main Titles. Is some of the stuff a bit sappy and overly sentimental? Sure, but this is a Dick Wolf production were talking here. This is network television escapism, and people love it.I think whenever you can hum themes or melodies besides a shows main title theme it is proof that the composer was able to do something more substantial than the rest. Atli rvarsson has done some pretty great work on Chicago Fire, and Im glad the music can get some of the spotlight with this Season 2 release. Be sure to grab the Season 1 album too, as the albums work better as a companion to one another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29PHB332KSN1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6G1CDK#wasThisHelpful","R29PHB332KSN1O","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Television scoring has taken leaps and bounds over the recent years with the boom of cable TV series. There is still a difference when you look at network television versus cable television when it comes to a dramatic series. A cable series usually has season long arcs with a shortened episode count (i.e. Game Of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Knick). A network series will usually have a higher episode count and a narrative that is in itself more episodic, meaning the episodes are not as tightly contained (i.e. NCIS, Law & Order, Person Of Interest). Chicago Fire falls in that latter group. These types of shows make it really difficult for a composer to craft a traditional score. Its often joked that these are all scored by ominous tones. Thankfully one of the more melodically driven composers out there found himself in the TV market. Atli rvarsson has surprisingly been able to inject emotionally driven and melodically engrossing music into his scores for not just Chicago Fire, but Chicago P.D. as well.Chicago Fire: Season 1 definitely acts more as a sampling of Atli rvarssons thematic material for the series. Creating an album from a season of 24 episodes is never easy, especially when its for a show like this. So what we have here is actually a pretty great collection of moments. You wont find an overall narrative arc of the show within the music presentation, but the score presented here is a great selection of emotional highlights. The Season 1 album focuses more on those heroic highs and lows. Taken on its own one may assume its very melodramatic, but keep in mind we are being given a whole platter of the exciting moments as well as the deeper emotional currents. If you listen to the Season 2 album you will notice more focus was put on character moments in that album. Overall though, Atli delivers the goods and injects his melodic sensibilities into a genre of TV that is known simply for ominous tones.Chicago Fire: Season 1 may be your typical network fluff, but Atli rvarsson jumped into TV after already having established himself as a premiere film composer. He learned the ropes working on huge blockbusters, and then creating a sonic style of his own for his solo projects. He has now taken that school of learning and injected it into network television, and the result I must say is pretty refreshing. Its great to hear old-school thematic work like the stuff from the 90s infused with heroism and emotional undercurrents. Chicago Fire: Season 1 is well worth checking out, as is the Season 2 album.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YHYKQBD2XDWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5BYN68#wasThisHelpful","R2YHYKQBD2XDWI","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Loft is your below average, run of the mill thriller about a bunch of skeevy guys who all rent a loft to bang chicks in behind their wives backs. All hell breaks loose when one of them find a dead naked woman handcuffed to the bed. So basically this is just a reimagining of Peter Bergs repulsive Very Bad Things I suppose. Composer John Frizzell is behind the score that unfortunately fails to really do anything of substance.When you start with the main title track one would think youre in for a fun score even though the film is incredibly disposable. The opening track is in fact quite good and very enticing. I loved the propulsive strings, it created an atmosphere of seductive suspicion. Immediately once track 2 starts, all that was working is now gone. For the rest of the 45-minutes of score youre subjected to atmospheric note holding. Pretty much being lets see how long we can hold this note on the strings before we have to introduce another note. I guess a better way to explain this score would be to imagine yourself sitting at a piano. Then strike any key of the piano but hold that key down, wait for that note to just barely fade away. Right as it fades away, go ahead and strike another key on the piano. Now, replace that piano with strings. There you have the score for The Loft. No tension building, no suspense, no dramatic builds and barely the hint of a central motif. I honestly could not tell the difference between tracks. The music has no narrative support or structure, and only adds maybe minimal atmosphere to this supposed mystery.The Loft is an instantly forgettable attempt at suspense scoring. The score adds absolutely nothing to the narrative and is barely structured at all. There is no sense of progression, no builds and just a fair hint of a central motif. The opening track is the only thing of note, but whatever momentum it builds immediately vanishes. If this score did any less, this would have been a scoreless movie.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXOOUVP20FDEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2J5VJC#wasThisHelpful","RXOOUVP20FDEC","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Australian director Fred Schepisi has only worked with 3 composers over his notable career. He started with fellow Australian Bruce Smeaton who scored films like Plenty, Roxanne and A Cry In The Dark for the director. Schepisi then built a notable collaboration with Jerry Goldsmith which resulted in films like The Russia House, Six Degrees Of Seperation and I.Q. After Goldsmiths death, Schepisi found and stuck with Paul Grabowsky who has scored his past five films including Words And Pictures. For this film we are given a very simple and a very short score. There is an admirable shine and bounce in the music, however due to its limited range it cant offer much in terms of narrative pull.The story follows Clive Owen and Juliette Binoche, they play an English teacher and an art teacher respectively. They form sort of a competition as to which form of artistic expression is more valuable, words or pictures. The film follows typical romantic drama structures, and the score is really there only to add that shine on certain moments. Its a 28-minute score with 26 tracks, so we have lots of tiny cues. When films implement this kind of scoring it always results in an interrupted musical flow. The music here is from a small orchestra with heavy focus on piano and strings. So with that being the case, the score sounds like tons of other romantic dramas that have come before it. Theres some quirkiness, theres a lightness, some serious moments, and things get romantic when they fall in love. By the time weve gone through the motions of the tired plot, we arent left with anything truly memorable in terms of style or approach. If I had a romance film about an English teacher and an art teacher, I probably would push my composer to create two themes for these two characters to contrast their differences. Then allow the themes to mesh and blend into a new love theme as the relationship develops. In the end it pretty much ends how it starts.While the score is nice, it isnt really memorable or really that unique. You can feel the composers hand behind the music, but the approach and structure leave it feeling familiar and disconnected. I feel like there was a missed potential to do something different, and the safe path was what was settled on. Grabowskys melodies are pleasant and the score doesnt offend, its fine for the purpose it serves. However, the approach and structure leave it feeling tired and uninspired.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AMPXBI20SP7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SAHWI8W#wasThisHelpful","R2AMPXBI20SP7G","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first Woman In Black surprised me immensely, both the film and Beltramis score. It was a wonderfully crafted horror tale that utilized atmosphere and production design to get your heart pumping instead of relying on jump scares and cheap editing. Beltrami delivered a score that focused on the characters instead of shadowing the edit, it was eerie and orchestrally lush which made everything feel uneasy and dangerous. While sequels are expected if a horror movie does well, they usually lose the luster of the first outing. The Woman In Black 2, unfortunately follows that trend. With Beltrami pretty much sitting this one out, it was on the shoulders of his additional writers Marcus Trumpp and Brandon Roberts to carry this one home. The result is a pretty fine-tuned lesson in horror scoring that showcases some talent from Beltramis two young apprentices even though it's rough around the edges.The Woman In Black 2 is nothing terribly different from the first score. Beltrami made sure the music stayed on track and didnt derail into formulaic territory. So the music itself here is lush and foreboding. It doesnt quite have that personal character touch that made the first score notable, but the presence of character themes woven through the score makes it engrossing. Unfortunately, those character themes arent the most memorable. Nothing thematic truly jumps out at you, and that can result in the music feeling a bit muddled. I usually compare horror scores to Hans Zimmers The Ring because its a notable example of a strong thematic score that focuses on characters yet still exudes danger through foreboding. Also The Ring 2 was taken over by two of Zimmers collaborators very much in the same way as The Woman In Black 2 was taken over by Beltramis collaborators. However, with The Woman In Black 2 the whole narrative feels like someone dipped their hands in paint and made swashes all across a blank canvass. You can feel patterns and structures, you can follow the path fine. However, it all comes across as muddled and has dull edges verses the sharp strokes you are looking for. The score is effective when it needs to be, but isn't as engrossing emotionally as Beltrami's solo score to the first film.The Woman In Black 2 is an effective score done in the same spirit of Marco Beltramis first outing. It lacks the more defined character shaping that the first score had, and the thematic work is nothing to write home about. Its still an engrossing score that serves its purpose. Not too much was lost in the progression from original to sequel, but this outing does indeed seem a little more watered down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGJK35WAOJE7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QNEKFTS#wasThisHelpful","RGJK35WAOJE7W","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marc Streitenfelds career is a fascinating one. He started as an assistant to Hans Zimmer, and moved up the ranks as a music editor, supervisor and advisor. Some of those early roles as a supervisor were on Ridley Scott films such as Black Hawk Down, Matchstick Men and Kingdom Of Heaven. This led to one of the most unique changing of the guards as Ridley Scott ended his long-time collaboration with Hans Zimmer and went with Streitenfeld. In fact, every single one of his scores prior to this has had Ridley Scott involved in some fashion be it as director or producer. We dont know what happened on Prometheus, but we can assume there were some creative differences as Harry Gregson-Williams was brought on to add a main theme and do some additional writing (in the same way he came onto Exodus). The Scott/Streitenfeld era came to an abrupt end. So how did Marc do in his first post-Ridley score? Well, quite fine indeed.Ive always been a huge fan of Marcs music. He is a unique voice in this industry, never has his music felt part of the mold. After The Fall is a very cliched film about a guy who is having financial trouble so he turns to armed robbery to make money for his family. Breaking Bad did a way more interesting character exploration of morality and genre craftsmanship with style than something like this straight to video type of movie. Despite the narrative limitations, Streitenfeld executes the story quite well. We witness the spiral downward of a character who is trying to do right by doing wrong. The score has limited function at a slim 32-minutes, but Streitenfeld is a master of setting mood and tone. He also is a master at evoking emotion through reflective thought. In other words, creating an existential reflection in your own mind. If youve never listened to The Grey then I strongly urge you to listen to that score (and watch the film) before diving into this. You can tell first-time director Saar Klein probably temped this film with Streitenfelds masterpiece of a score to The Grey. The whole thing feels like Marc is dancing around that old score of his, gently dipping the paint brush into the existential tragedy of The Grey and finding a new way to structure it here. Does it work here? Yes. But not as well as it did in The Grey. The score does find a way to come to a very satisfying emotional resolution after a bit of stylistic meandering. Its appropriate that the best track on this score is Home Sweet Home, which is also the longest track at over 4-minutes. It shows that music needs room to grow, and that Streitenfeld can do amazing things if given the canvas to do so.Marc Streitenfelds After The Fall shows what the composer does best. I really love his music and the way he approaches scoring. Something about his style resonates so deeply. Its nice to be able to be immersed in the Streitenfeld sound once again even if his first post-Ridley score is nothing notably different or better than what weve seen him accomplish in the past. After The Fall feels like a slimmed down version of The Grey, but it still works. Im probably forgiving more of the scores limitations simply because Im just happy to have a new Marc score for the first time in 2 years. I hope Streitenfeld falls into another groove with a musically driven director that will allow him to work unhinged on some great projects. This composer can do great things with the right material, and even do decent things with not so good material such as this. For that, After The Fall is worth your time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B4GGXR3AG0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QH23VXS#wasThisHelpful","R2B4GGXR3AG0U","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ethel is a unique documentary from HBO that provides a point of view you dont see very often. Rory Kennedy is the youngest of the 11 children of Ethel and Robert F. Kennedy, She is also an acclaimed documentary filmmaker who gained attention for her film, Ghosts Of Abu Ghraib. Ethel is a documentary about her mother and her mother's public life with her father, Robert F. Kennedy. Rory Kennedy was born 6 months after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, so she never knew her father. This project is both her journey and ours as we get a first person view from her mother and the people in her life. Rory Kennedy continues her collaboration with composer Miriam Cutler, who is probably the greatest documentary composer of our generation. Ethel is a wonderful exploration and portrait of a human being, and the score acts like a narrative instead of a traditional doc score. It may come across as too bouncy and light in some areas, but overall accentuates the emotional current of the film.Even though Ive interviewed many doc composers here on Film.Music.Media (including Miriam) I still find the process of musical narration for a documentary such an interesting and challenging subject. For this score I tried to see it through director Rory Kennedys eyes and how she worked with Miriam to craft this film. I mean, she is part of one of the most famous and important families in world history. When you say Kennedy, so many different events, eras and people come to mind. Now imagine being part of that family and being a doc filmmaker who wants to explore your mothers amazing life. In a nutshell, the music is that. Ethels score is Ethel Kennedys life. Cutler does a fantastic job at setting up this family story and taking us through some of the most defining moments of this womans life, but also keeps in mind that this is also the directors journey of family exploration as well. The melodic structure is strong and it holds everything together supremely. In fact, this score does a lot of heavy-lifting for a doc score. Its sound and approach craft a nice sentimental tone, but its also very mindful and respectful. When you dance that line as a composer I can imagine you want to make sure youre handling the material as respectfully as you can, which this score is a great example of that. That occasionally results in music that is overly cheery and a bit schmaltzy, but then again when is a conversation with your mother ever not schmaltzy? Those overly sentimental moments though dont detract from the strong and subtle moments of this score. Cutler handles the quieter moments with grace, I felt the real heart of the story in those moments. That is where this score truly shines.Ethel is as personal of a documentary as you'll find. It focuses on the mother of the director of the film, and the mother happens to be Ethel Kennedy. This family portrait feels intimate and small even though the life events of this family are huge and impactful. Miriam Cutler does a superb job of providing a score that guides the audience through this story. While it may get a bit overly sentimental at times, the music never becomes a distraction and that is what allows the score to work so well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A8KTPDX0ZUY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NW6KN6U#wasThisHelpful","R2A8KTPDX0ZUY7","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Wingo has done a variety of work that has proven his versatility as a composer, from raunchy comedies to dark dramas. While Wingo isnt known as a documentary composer, he demonstrates that he knows how to handle the material. Wingo shows that he can craft the exact mood and tone that the filmmakers want the audience to be feeling. The Great Invisible is a doc about the Deepwater Horizon oil rig tragedy that took place in the Gulf Of Mexico in 2010. The documentary looks at the response from many points of view including the oil workers and the oil companies. Wingo provides a mostly ambient score with a southern twang to it, but it does a really good job of holding this documentary together.The score is designed to work around many talking heads and stock footage, as does any doc score. I wasnt surprised by the ambient nature of the score, but was surprised by how Wingo was able to infuse subtle melodies and motifs throughout the body of the score. I really loved the way it played out, and it totally absorbed me with its personality. Bass riffs, percussive textures, and echoing harmonicas give it this haunted southern noir feel. The more ambient sections of the score leave enough room for the picture to be built on top of it, but still manage to create slow builds that can hook you during a solo listen. The music is never heavy-handed and does just the right amount of legwork for this documentary that tries to open up a conversation.The Great Invisible is a hypnotizing and absorbing score to a documentary about the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history. Wingos score has enough style and personality to be aesthetically intriguing yet just the right amount of structuring to support the film without ever getting in the way. I think this is a doc score that managed to find that elusive fine line of artistic expression and film serviceability. Documentary scoring is always something that can just sit in the background unnoticed or do too much to sway emotionally, but Wingo found a great balance that makes it effective and engrossing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HXGKVXH0WLXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUCJNN2#wasThisHelpful","R3HXGKVXH0WLXT","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gary Yershon joins writer/director Mike Leigh for their fourth collaboration together. Mr. Turner is a biopic examining the life of painter J.M.W. Turner. Its an examination of the world through the eyes of a revolutionary artist, which poses an interesting sonic canvas for Yershon. The music here is accompanying a visual artist and his interactions in the world around him. While very simple in its approach, the score does a great job of crafting a poignant portrait of the man even if its simplistic approach leaves much to be desired in terms of emotional depth.Mr. Turners score could be described more as a performance piece than a narrative story. When I closed my eyes I could see the music moving in strokes. It felt very appropriate that you could feel the music moving almost like a paint brush. The musical structure reminds me very much of painting, and I could almost see this music accompanying a visual movement performance such as a dance. In that sense, it lacks narrative form and unfortunately no real emotional depth. You will get a sense of progression, but a very limited one. The score is very short at just under 30-minutes, and due to it working in short bursts it has limited range. The score was so short in fact that the album contains music from an unrelated short film Mike Leigh directed that Yershon also composed. A Running Jumps score is a nice addition here, and personally something I found more interesting due to its textures and style. Yershons score to Mr. Turner functions more as a musical touch-up instead of a full-on narrative. The musics nature to evoke movement in the listeners mind is a very interesting thing, but it never does anything to really stand out.Mr. Turner is a fine score for what it is, it wont wow you or change your life. However, its approach and simple structure is worth exploring. There is life in this score, and it comes out in strokes of motion as dictated by simple strings. Never does it feel like a period piece score or a biopic score, and for that its noteworthy. The score simply exists, but since it feels like a floating creation it lacks a narrative flow and is light on emotional depth.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHVSYKEDDWI7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P62WMLW#wasThisHelpful","RHVSYKEDDWI7T","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bank$tas is a piss-poor excuse of a raunchy comedy made with practically no budget, but also no talent either. Two finance grads get hired by a top investment bank only to discover their boss is creating an investment fraud scheme with student loans. Cue the sex, drugs and rock and roll. If you can get through the trailer youll notice that it looks like it was made by film school dropouts. I cant say its any better for the score by Steve London. The score feels like a hashed up and phoned in attempt of copying that gritty comedy style that other composers and filmmakers are doing much better.I could go on bashing this really bad film, but instead of me saying how much is sucks I will try and analyze why it sucks. First of all, no central thematic structure (any structure for that matter). Each track feels like it was scoring different scenes in the same style. Its an electronic score that just reuses loops and beats. All the textures and stylings feel like something cooked up in Garage Band or someone who is vaguely trying to channel the Ocean's Eleven scores but hasn't seen the films since they were in theaters. Nothing ever amounts to anything or leads anywhere. For comparison lets look at a great composer like Christopher Lennertz who is absolutely owning the R-rated comedy genre right now. His scores are tons of fun, characteristic, stylistic and work with the comedy happening onscreen. You can look at something like Horrible Bosses or Ride Along and see how music should work in a comedy of this nature. Bank$tas is an example of how it fails. This is the result when a composer is handed a poorly made film probably filled with the writers' and director's favorite music as temp, and decides to phone it in. The music opens with a terrible original rap song, sort of moves into some jazz sounding stylings, and ends up in the 70s porn category of sounds. And if the opening original rap song wasnt enough, dont worry because they have a closing ""End Title"" rap song too. Be sure to check out tracks like Limp Dicks and Smoking Strawberry Fields, because everyone knows that titties + weed = comedy.Save yourself the embarrassment and waste of time. Bank$tas is a piss-poor excuse of a movie and a piss-poor example of the craft of film scoring. Im amazed this got a soundtrack release, simply amazed. Filmmakers, and composers specifically, should study this if they want to know what not to do. The music feels so mechanized and inorganic, as if a human had nothing to do with it. Zero emotions, zero character, zero atmosphere, zero structure and a style that would best suit a toddler banging on one of those Casio keyboards you had in pre-school. I don't wanna come across an old bitter dad (I'm only 27 anyways), because I love comedies of all nature. I love stoner comedies, I love dick jokes and physical comedy involving bodily fluids. Gratuitous nudity? Sure, toss it in... as long as the comedy works! This Is The End? Hilarious. Henry Jackman's score? Perfect for it. This wreck of a score and film thinks its funny without ever being funny, and that's why it fails so badly. Bank$tas gets the coveted zero star rating, I think a first for Film.Music.Media at the time of this review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IKKG4R3BCVT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R9ST2RI#wasThisHelpful","R1IKKG4R3BCVT5","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here we are again, the completion of another Middle Earth trilogy from Peter Jackson and Howard Shore. As I reflected back on The Hobbit films and scores, I realized they didnt leave as much of a lasting impact as The Lord Of The Rings. The thematic impact of The Hobbit scores were much less, and this is mainly due to the fact that Warner Brothers forced Jackson to make three films out of a a 320 page novel. This resulted in Shores score having to feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread. as Bilbo once said. The final product is a 3-act story being spread across 3 lengthy films instead of 3 books being adapted into three lengthy films. That doesn't mean though that Howard didn't perfectly accompany the narrative here. We indeed to have some brilliant scores, including this one. The first score was a great introduction to this journey, however the main motif of it wasnt written by Shore. But he ran with the Misty Mountains motif and made it work. The second score, while strong, lacked thematic structure. It had to fill space for most of the second act narrative and pretty much kill time till movie #3. Now for The Battle Of The Five Armies, we truly see that Shore was saving the best for last. We finally have fully realized thematic structures, and the score becomes a tremendous experience.What you notice about this score is that it truly hits the ground running, and thats expected since this entire film is the third act of a story that has taken us two films to get here. The added narrative filler does hurt the trilogy somewhat and story-wise makes them inferior to The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, but in no way are The Hobbit films bad films. The Battle Of The Five Armies is a whopping epic of a score. Shore weaves themes with propulsive melodies to build a sense of scope and magnitude that we havent heard since The Return Of The King. Rousing battles, threatening intensity, wholly organic emotions and a swelling tone of regality make the whole score an absorbing epic. Shore references some familiar themes from the LOTR trilogy that creates a nice bridge and truly makes these films feel part of Middle Earth. We wrap up the journey in a nice sentimental fashion that reminds us that Frodos journey is what lies ahead. Overall, The Battle Of The Five Armies does a fantastic job of providing a rousing climactic epic to this adventure embedded in a world of fantasy.Howard Shores music for Peter Jacksons adaptations of the Middle Earth saga has become an iconic part of our culture. In many ways it was the Star Wars of a different generation; a truly engrossing journey filled with characters we love and a story we resonated with. Middle Earth felt like a real place because of Shores music, and the characters felt real because of the thematic arcs he built for them musically. The Battle Of The Five Armies is a superb final act to this long and sometimes tiring journey of Bilbo Baggins, but after 3 films we can smile contently as we have another great trilogy worth getting lost in. WaterTower Records fantastic special edition treatment of the score is worth snapping up immediately to complete your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KTIAS96Z17CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIG3CAC#wasThisHelpful","R2KTIAS96Z17CI","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up in the time when the genre of trailer music became a thing. Before advertising music, movie trailers just used other movie scores almost as a temp track. I remember the trailer for Braveheart and how it used Mark Mancinas Speed. I remember the trailer for The Lost World and how it used Hans Zimmers Backdraft. The brotherly composing duo known as E.S. Posthumous brought this sort of epic cinematic music with a modern edge to the spotlight, even though Yoav Gorens Immediate Music can probably be credited as the pioneer of music licensing libraries. E.S. Posthumous never really composed music for trailers, even though their music was used in them a lot. As a budding film score enthusiast it was easy to fall in love with these trailer music companies like Immediate Music, X-Ray Dog, Extreme Music and many more. As the internet evolved we were able to use it to find this rare sect of music that was never released commercially. Using Napster and Morpheus, people like me could build a trailer music library of sorts with many thanks to soundtrack.net at the time. Thankfully, we dont live in those dark ages anymore. Trailer music is celebrated and cherished these days as a way for composers to really try out different styles and genres that will hopefully entice production companies to use their music to build epic 2-minute teasers.This compilation album is a gathering of some great trailer music composers out there, and while in no way a score album it definitely represents many characteristics of film scores. My only issue with compilation albums (of any kind), are that they are usually a pieced together list of tracks that don't relate to each other. I would much rather have full albums from these music houses, and luckily many of them have CD albums available. But for a sole purpose of having a sampling of different styles of trailer music, this album is a good starting point. Not all the tracks are fully inspired here, and you'll probably find yourself leaning towards certain composers over others. In a time where digital music has broken the album experience, I kind of turn my head at compilation albums. Why would I want someone else's playlist of music when I could build my own? Music houses like Immediate Music and Two Steps From Hell have released amazing albums of their music, those are worth checking out way more over a compilation in my opinion. I feel that celebrating trailer music as a real genre of music by having these music groups release albums of their own music is fantastic. I feel like releasing a piecemeal compilation actually reverses the idea of trailer music as art and takes it back to being simply disconnected commercial tunes.Epic Music, Vol. 1 is a great way to get different styles of trailer music in one package. Hopefully it will inspire you to seek out these music groups own albums of music that does wonders to spark the imagination. If you just love swelling and emotional tracks then youll get a rise out of this album, but its also a great mind sparker for filmmakers. If youre into editing, writing or shooting of any kind then I cant tell you many times Ive used trailer music to spark ideas in my own work. Definitely check the album out to hopefully spark your own curiosity. But since I'm not a fan of compilation albums of any kind really, I highly suggest seeking out the solo albums released by these awesome composers. But if you want to get your feet wet first in this genre, then, this might be the album for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CM2W0AKU269M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5LQF4K#wasThisHelpful","R1CM2W0AKU269M","A27CHILBK6HIL2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27CHILBK6HIL2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You know...It's funny: When it was announced that Rare would be bought out by Microsoft, they made it seem like it would be a decision that would greatly enhance not only the Xbox lineup, but Rare's own creations. Over a decade later, we learn not only has the famous development team churned out way less titles than when they were with Nintendo and prior, but notable franchises such as Conker and Banjo-Kazooie haven't fared well at all from the purchase. This installment in particular pretty much convinced Microsoft to have Rare only make Kinect Sports games from that point on until this year, when they suddenly released one of the best video game collections ever made.But anyway, Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts is the FIFTH Banjo game in the series, NOT the third. You see, despite Rare being owned by Microsoft, they were still allowed to make games for the Game Boy Advance and eventually the Nintendo DS, two of them being Banjo games; 2003 saw the release of Banjo Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge, an original platforming-adventure that took place between the first two games, and two years later there was Banjo Pilot, which was basically a kart-racer except with planes. Because THQ, the titles' publisher, didn't promote them much at all, they've become drastically overlooked in comparison to the other games in the series.So if anything, I would gladly consider Grunty's Revenge to be the real ""Banjo Threeie"" over this crap.The first glaring issue with the game is how egotistical it is of itself. The story is basically a re-enactment of a meeting at Microsoft (or so I like to think of it), as Banjo, Kazooie, and living 80s computer L.O.G. remind me a lot of bickering executives. L.O.G. persuades to Bear and Bird that nobody likes playing platformers anymore (Because Super Mario Galaxy totally bombed, right?), and that kids today just want to shoot things. The result? L.O.G. shoves the duo into a mission-based game involving cars. No, seriously. How L.O.G. decided to pick a car theme out of the idea that kids like shooting games is beyond my knowledge.Missions are held within various themed worlds as can be expected, but everything is so ridiculously played out this time. Each world opens up like some corny television program, and the supporting characters of each world are literally placed in a role as if they were actors. Whatever happened to the naturally whimsical feel of the original games? Nuts and Bolts instead has everything mechanically in place, and the game itself constantly likes to believe there isn't even a fourth wall, as everything is pointed out as they know they're in a game. They even talk about wondering if this game would be successful, Kazooie complaining about not having her abilities from older games, etc. I thought video games are supposed to make you think you're in another reality that's unlike our own, not outright admit it's all a setup from the get-go.Because of the mission-based play, don't expect to do much when you're not assigned anything; the environments are basically empty playgrounds you could explore by driving your car. The missions themselves are usually things that involve your car (Duh), but even when you try your best to ignore the fact that this carries the Banjo Kazooie name, the missions don't feel as robust or rewarding as platforming challenges one conquers in the adventuring titles. They feel a lot like the missions from Mario Kart DS's Mission mode, except less fun and with lesser variety. Certain objectives are rather vague, while some others can be frustrating all because the car's wonky ""realistic"" control schemes would throw you off.Because of all this, I actually ended up getting BORED playing this game, which is something I never expected a game by Rare to cause. I was increasingly growing tired of doing car-based missions that all require me to sit in the thing and drive it in ways that aren't as reliable as they should have been. The scary part is I gave this game many, many chances to appeal to me, but every play session I attempted, I ended up wanting to play anything else on my Rare Replay disc and/or Banjo Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge. Don't play this game if you don't want your memories of Bear and Bird tainted.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QP5ESSWTSB11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019MLWL4#wasThisHelpful","R3QP5ESSWTSB11","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quick disclaimer: I paid $2 for my used copy. Easily the only deal I ever found good enough for this game.For those of you that have been living under a rock or something, Angry Birds is a little game that Rovio released on mobile devices for $0.99 back when smartphone gaming began to take off. Because of that, it quickly became a cultural phenomenon and spawned numerous more games. I'd be fine with that, but then Activision came along and got an idea: ""Let's make easy cash on this trend by releasing overpriced $40 ($20 for handheld, but that's still $19 more than the original price) versions of some Angry Birds games for store shelves so little kids can spot them and bug their clueless parents until they fall into the scam!""There's a reason why I didn't buy this Nintendo 3DS edition of Angry Birds Star Wars when it came out; supporting full retail priced Angry Birds is like supporting Destiny: The Taken King.Anyway, Angry Birds Star Wars continues the simplistic physics-based mechanics that the series has been known for since its debut in 2009. You use your eyeballs to scan the level layout, slingshot some birds across, and hope that they crush the opposing green pigs, whether by direct means or toppling over wood or stone structures. The birds are color-coded, as what unique ability they can use (especially in the case of Star Wars) depends on the color of the bird. For example, red birds can swing the lightsaber, and yellow birds shoot with Han Solo's signature blaster.The level designs proudly emphasize on its surroundings, as you could try and knock out the pigs right then and there, but there are also ways you could strategically launch birds in areas that would cause catastrophic results against the pigs. There are mirrors that can reflect the blaster lasers, TNT boxes to blow up, and the game even takes a few cues from Angry Birds Space by including some gravity-based layouts. With well over 200 of these levels, plus 20 more levels that are apparently exclusive to this version of the game (not that it would justify the purchase alone), there's plenty of bird-slinging action to go around. It's madly addicting to fire off a bird or few, and it's always satisfying to watch the layouts get destroyed by your antics. Star Wars makes things even more interesting thanks to its theme and unique Jedi powers the birds carry. It's somewhat odd that this game runs in 30fps instead of 60 (I mean, really? It's freaking Angry Birds!), but it's easy to get used to, and is by no means a dealbreaker.Angry Birds Star Wars is indeed recommended, but of course, only if you buy it for cheap. Now that copies can be spotted for as low as $4 (if not lower, considering how much I paid for mine), I think it's okay to buy into it if you have a few bucks to spare and/or aren't as fond of doing this stuff on mobile phones as you would on a Nintendo handheld. It's nowhere as criminal as the initial price, that's for sure.As for the business practices to begin with, they certainly get a -1/5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GYLP316CQWKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DWXV1CI#wasThisHelpful","R3GYLP316CQWKH","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How the crap do licensed games keep surprising me in expectations? Various games based off of movies or television shows are usually considered to be the bottom of the barrel for video gaming, yet I tend to find that they simply fluctuate in quality. Activision's video game based off of the new Spongebob movie certainly sucked big time, but the game based off of frickin' G-FORCE of all things is actually not bad! Heck, whole development teams like Wayforward and Telltale Games are notable for defying the majority rule of licensed games; they consistently make their games well!Being that the Game Boy Advance has always been home to excellent portable games and surprising gems, I was hoping that this game based off of the Mucha Lucha cartoon would be decent enough. BOY WAS I WRONG! Turns out this is one of the worst beat 'em ups I've ever played. Oopsie. Imagine playing a game like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade classic; strip out the charm, variety, and make the controls and hit detection sloppy. Oh, and make the bosses easy enough for you to button-mash on the A or B button to beat. That's this game. If it wasn't ultimately repetitive enough to be fighting the same kind of baddies over and over, the lousy lack of effort in the mechanical workings would definitely work its way in to irk you throughout your potentially short-lived playtime.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XFUJ8W6JP21D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000E330Y#wasThisHelpful","R2XFUJ8W6JP21D","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in 1996, Kawasaki's notable appearance in the video gaming industry was a sponsorship in Nintendo's superb water racing classic, Wave Race 64. Fast forward to 2008, Wave Race 64 has already seen a release on the Wii Virtual Console sans the sponsorship, but Kawasaki allowed for another development team to feature its name on a jet skiing video game. The difference, however, is that this development team is the bane of the Wii's existence, and while Kawasaki Jet Ski is probably the best game they've created, it doesn't seem like it really says a whole lot.Kawasaki Jet Ski's menus REEK of ""budget (or lack of) title"", as they are some of the most static uninteresting menus I've seen in a Wii game, although that may as well apply to pretty much anything put out by Data Design Interactive. The thing that irks me here however is that it's pretty obvious they wanted this game to be their own Wave Race, but Wave Race had animation and charm in their menus. This doesn't.There are three game modes: racing, balloon popping, and stunt performing. There are only ever four courses per mode, but the main racing selections apparently pretend there's more to it, as there are Bronze, Silver, and Gold cups, and all the modes have ""two classes"". To save you some time, though, I'm going to be blunt and tell you that the only difference between the cups is that the tracks are in different orders; the classes also don't affect anything at all in any mode whatsoever.As shameful and poor as this game seems, there is actually something to the racing gameplay that I do think works well enough. Contrary to most of DDE's games, the controls actually WORK (albeit slightly inaccurate)....when you're not doing the stunt performances. But anyway, the game functions similarly to Wave Race in terms of control. You steer your jet ski left and right around the water, and newly added to this simple formula are Nitro balloons, which allow you to use a Boost by shaking the Wii Remote once after the bar is filled to the extent of your liking. I actually do think this has good potential, but the tracks are simple in design and don't take advantage of the racing as Wave Race would do. And since there's really only four of them, your interest would fade before long.Speaking of four, the balloon popping and stunt performance modes have that amount. The balloon popping is super-strict, as it just BARELY gives you enough time to pop each and every balloon or balloon chains scattered around the tracks. As for the stunts..........Again, the control is broken here. Data Design Interactive has always been awful at putting in motion control, and that's apparently how you do the majority of the stunts.I could imagine this game being a guilty pleasure of mine for when I'm bored and feel like racing in a cup (not all of them for obvious reasons), but as I see it in reality, the game is absolutely bare-bones and totally not worth playing through any more than a cup. There are far better options out there; after all, there IS a Wave Race game on the Gamecube, and the Wii is backwards-compatible with Gamecube games, so that may as well be your calling if you crave these kind of games.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G5Q5CR46ACUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00125OMZG#wasThisHelpful","R1G5Q5CR46ACUL","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Holy crap, guys! Yet ANOTHER gem on the Wii U? Nintendo, you shouldn't have! Since you have though, I will gladly crave every single bit of it.Anyway, when Mario Maker was first announced, I liked to joke about it and call it the ""New Super Mario Bros. development tool"", and at best I thought it was a cute little tool and nothing much more. Fast forward to one of the biggest events in gaming history, the Nintendo World Championships, having made a grand return and ultimately epic finale by using levels made with the game, and now I'm all over it! As the 30th Anniversary title for the Super Mario Bros. series, not only does it knock the 25th Anniversary game (a direct retail port of Super Mario All-Stars for the Wii with underwhelming extras) out of the park, but buying this game feels like getting the keys to an amusement park! Heck, it could even be better!So what makes Super Mario Maker special? Well, if you haven't known by this point, YOU CAN MAKE MARIO LEVELS!!! It may not be the first video game to utilize a level-designing concept, but COME ON! IT'S FREAKING MARIO!! The franchise that practically invented the platforming genre, and with this title, YOU are in control of it! And not only do you get to make your own Mario levels, but you can also play levels made by pretty much anybody else that owns the game by going online via the ""Course World"" feature. As of this writing, it's been reported that there's already a MILLION levels uploaded to be played by people around the globe, so I think it's safe to say there's plenty of content here!What I was personally blown away by was how instant getting to play other levels is! Levels, online or not, can be selected and played on a whim; the option is there, but you don't even have to download them! You can just play from the get-go, and the variety of levels people have made have been absolutely stunning (although I guess there's an over-abundance of levels that troll you or play themselves). If there are levels you don't like, you can just move on and play others. Or better yet: You can MAKE YOUR OWN!At first, the level designing aspects are a little bit limited. You don't start out with ALL the customizable sets, but once you decide to sit down and create to your heart's desire, you'll realize that even with the content you start out with, the sky is pretty much the limit. There are countless ways any selectable object could be used! Enemies can be stacked on top of each other, you can make them fly, grow big, or stuff them in blocks, blocks and coins can be spread around and laid out in any way imaginable, etc. It's also a good way to challenge yourself and learn how to make decent levels with such content handed out so far. As time passes on while you play with the course maker, however, you'll get more and more to work with until you finally have all the sets of objects available, and that's where things get kicked into high gear! Flying Koopa Clown Cars, Yoshi, P-Switches, vines, and many more course elements would be put to great use as YOU, the designer, cram and make as much use of these things as possible! Even sub-areas and selectable sound/visual effects would be available for you to toy with the level atmosphere!With such a robust level creator and editor, I can't believe I'm about to say it, but I had so much fun creating levels in Super Mario Maker! Usually, level editing isn't all too exciting. In fact, even when I get to make my own independent games this day and age, and while the ideas I usually have appeal to me quite a lot, there are certain inevitable instances where game designing would feel kind of tedious. But with Super Mario Maker? I found myself wanting to do MORE levels after I've unleashed a new creation! The Mario Paint-esc interface makes it incredibly easy to build your level, and you're able to switch between testing and editing the level, again, ON A WHIM! It's an absolute joy finding your urge and witnessing your designs come to life before your eyes! It's even fun when you experiment with certain objects and watch how they work during gameplay; it makes things interesting as you learn about what happens, whether or not it works, and how you could put it into effect if it does.You start out with two themes: One for Super Mario Bros, and the other for New Super Mario Bros. U. However, like the objects, you eventually get to use Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World themes. I personally think it's misleading to call these ""themes"", there's more differences between the games than just the graphics. For example: If you pick Super Mario World, you'll get to use the spin jump and ride Yoshi, and if you pick New Super Mario Bros. U, you get to wall jump, ground pound, and do that twirl in the air. I never thought Super Mario World would look any better than it already has, but the HD and even-more-smoothed-out control convinced me otherwise. Super Mario Bros., definitely got the biggest benefit; considering how limited the original game was, it's quite amazing to see how it can now be given a variety and scale that is on par with its successors. While not every enemy and platform from each game is selectable, the sets are composed of a compromise of objects you can use for each theme. Super Mario World, for example, doesn't have the Chargin' Chucks or fireball-spitting flowers present, but you can use Hammer Bros. and Chain Chomps, so the selection is still far from underwhelming.Playing a Mario level (assuming the user-made level doesn't feature anything that trolls the player or takes control away) is as fun as it's always been, except you can finally bask in the glory that is the 80s and 90s Mario games with brand new level designs! The control has been refined to perfection (especially for Super Mario Bros.), and the new elements that you'd discover by means of playing various levels can make the titles feel fresh and new again. Never would I have thought I'd be facing Bowser Jr. in a Koopa Clown Car while avoiding Magikoopas and Wigglers in the original Super Mario Bros! And regardless of how the level itself fares, and whether or not if it's your level, it's always fun passing the controller to someone else and see how he or she would react.Perhaps the closest things there are to an actual structured campaign are the 10- and 100- Mario Challenges. These challenges have you play through a series of randomly selected levels (the most being 16); the 10- Mario Challenges go over Sample courses (and as such, unlock more), and the 100- Mario Challenges grab levels from the Internet. Interestingly, beating a 100- Mario Challenge grants you an unlockable Mystery Mushroom costume, which can also be done simply by using Amiibo. When Mario uses the Mystery Mushroom, he turns into whatever surprising sprite you set it to, and literally any Amiibo out there can allow Mario to turn into the characters those Amiibo represent (That is, if you're not up to playing loads of levels through 100- Mario Challenges, but I think I'd rather do that anyway).The Amiibo and Mystery Mushroom usages are sadly more-or-less for decoration, as Mario doesn't gain any special powers or anything like that. However, that's a mere nitpick for what is otherwise probably one of the greatest Mario games to date. The possibilities with the courses you can make or play are ENDLESS! I STRONGLY recommend you pick this one up if you like fun! Don't own a Wii U? Then maybe it's about time you get one and stop missing out on stuff like this!For those of you who already own the game, here are my levels I made and uploaded for all to play!Nostalgia Bound Vol. 1: 9FIB-0000-0043-1979Nostalgia Bound Vol. 2: 7611-0000-0043-63BBSituational: 7962-0000-0043-87B1Nostalgia Bound Vol. 3: CAA4-0000-0044-D88BHow to Troll Awfully: 85A8-0000-0047-23FCRemembering the Undersea Melody: 0288-0000-004B-12F8Beyond Scope and Scale: 4BCD-0000-0054-739BDonkey Kong Junior Returns: C78A-0000-0063-9DD2The Mountainous Castle: 83A3-0000-0069-2ACCPS: If you worry about encountering one too many stupidly hard levels, do yourself a favor and play the 100 Mario Challenge on NORMAL difficulty.

"You've seen bunches of video games based on movies and cartoon shows every now and then, but then suddenly we have a game based off of.....a nature documentary. This is going to be a FUN one, guys!Arctic Tale is a video game where you control a polar bear, and eventually you get to control a few other animals as well, but it's mainly about the polar bear. Kinda. I honestly wouldn't even know if this is even supposed to be an actual adventure, because the game's missions are often, if entirely, composed of minigames. It may seem like the game would be a 3D platformer starring a polar bear or something like that, but then suddenly your bear will be a living shuffleboard disc or sliding down an ice slope with half-working controls.Despite that the back of the box says the Wii's Nunchuck controllers are usable, the game itself encourages you to take it off the Wii Remote. Instead of moving via an analog stick, the game thought it would be better off for you to POINT AND CLICK (whilst holding down a button) to get the polar bear moving! It could probably work in a game solely created to be a story-orientated point 'n click game, but the story here is totally minimal, and the structure is set up like another genre.The minigames you have to do are just as crappy of course. The most functional minigame in the lot is probably the shuffleboard one, with its ice physics being the only flaw about it relatively to everything else. Certain minigames are outright uncontrollable, and others are simply embarrassing. The most major one is the polar bear fighting, where one bear would duke it out against another by shoving each other on an ice platform. Sounds like fun? Too bad you don't control any of it! It's all automated as you button-mash to quick-time events, and the bears themselves look like they're very lazily struggling to put up any sort of fight whatsoever, so it's often unintentionally hilarious to watch.All things considered, Arctic Tale is exactly how you may have expected it to turn out on the Wii: Sloppy, unpolished, and unplayable.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VDZKCJP0I3KJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RW3V84#wasThisHelpful","R1VDZKCJP0I3KJ","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After one of the greatest and most recognizable arcade games in history came into the scene, the yellow muncher that starred in the hit went on to be featured in sequels for years before the home console became immensely popular thanks to the likes of Nintendo. Pac-Man and two other games in the series would be ported faithfully to the Nintendo Entertainment System, but in terms of new games, Pac had to wait until the Super NES era to get some more. While they've had their time in the spotlight briefly, out comes Pac-Man World on the Playstation in 1999/2000 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the chomping ball's existence in gaming. Little did as much people know, however, about the OTHER Pac-Man game that came around during that time.Pac-Man: Adventures in Time is a tragically overlooked game in the franchise that was only ever released for PC during the witnessing of the 21st century. Rather than being developed directly by Namco, production was handled by Hasbro and Creative Asylum, so I guess they didn't...promote it much?? I personally managed to stumble upon this game a very long time ago as I was, and still am, a huge-enough Pac-Fan to play more of the series than just the arcade classics. But enough about me; let's talk about why this game is a must-play!If you can excuse the brief but silly storyline about an amulet that stabilizes Pac-Land's freedom from terror being smashed and scattered across time, Pac-Man Adventures in Time should make anyone that's played a Pac-Man game feel home, because the game consists of running around a maze, eating all the dots in the maze, being chased by ghosts, eating the ghosts after consuming Power Pellets, and snagging bonus fruits and other objects worth points. It is the typical arcade-style Pac-Man formula (with the ability to jump a la Pac-Mania), presented in a gorgeous Sega Dreamcast-looking 3D world.With that said, I'd be lying if I said this was exactly like the originals. Being that this is a retail video game made in 2000, there are 45 mazes you go through before you end up beating the game, each handful being divided up into several different time periods, whether they be in the Wild West or in Prehistoric Times, for example. The mazes may have their own subtle gimmicks, such as a button by a piano that causes the ghosts to stop and dance, snakes that when awake will bite and stun Pac-Man upon contact, rolling boulders, and even extra maze layers. The mazes themselves often (but not every time) tend to borrow the designs of ones from Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, but the little things added in each maze do help give it a nice sense of variety and keep things fresh.Every division of mazes, there will be a couple times where you play a bonus minigame. The minigames don't necessarily have to be beaten to move on, as their goals consist of getting good amounts of points to score, but they are fun little distractions in their own right, if a little lacking at certain points. Whatever the case may be, though, you better hope to get as many points as you can, because while Pac-Man: Adventures in Time doesn't SEEM hard, extra lives are rather scarce, as you could only get one every 50,000 points. One may most likely not be challenged too much when playing most of the game, but when the time comes, it will hit HARD. Perhaps my only real complaint with this game is that even when saving your progress, the amount of lives will stay the same. Since the game asks you to save every couple mazes, there fortunately is at least time to change your score for the better.As progress is made in the game generally, there is actually a healthy dose of unlockable content. There are plenty of extra mazes with features unique to those mazes, the minigames could be freely played, and you could not only view the little cutscenes that play throughout the game, but also unlock bonus ""outtakes"" and other little bits of goofiness with Pac-Man and co. It's fun to make the extra effort to achieve these things, as well as check them out.All things considered, Pac-Man: Adventures in Time is a lovely hidden entree that should be very tasty for Pac-Fans or gamers in general (but especially Pac-Fans of course) that are willing to play a game on the computer. What makes this even more recommendable is that this game can actually run just fine on pretty much every Windows computer there is (Not that I've tried on Windows 10, however; I currently own a Windows 8), so fans of any Windows generation could buckle down and love this game!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18A370VFM1F2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004T782#wasThisHelpful","R18A370VFM1F2I","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you thought Mario Kart 8 was already one of the best games in the series and a top-tier title for the Nintendo Wii U, just wait til you see that there's yet another positive to be known about the title: For the first time ever in gaming history, there's a video game that has reasonably priced DLC! This is actually a bundle of two DLC packs for the game, but it's a lot easier to judge it as one.Not only do you get to have new characters come to the Mario universe to kart around such as Link from the Zelda series and Villager and Isabelle from Animal Crossing, but there are also four brand-new cups featuring half-and-half of shiny new original tracks and shiny new renditions of classic courses from Mario Karts gone by! Certain tracks include locations from the aforementioned series our new drivers are from, AND F-Zero and Excitebike; it's like this game is turning into Nintendo Kart (Although there are still a good dose of Mario-related tracks)! And I dunno if Nintendo implanted some sort of mind-reading device on me, but somehow they knew I wanted Ribbon Road and Cheese Land to return from Mario Kart Super Circuit! They're here, and oh my god they're simply BEAUTIFUL along with the rest of the DLC and game!!!If the concept of a handful of characters and four cups to choose from sounds familiar to any of you out there, that's because that's the same kind of structure the Mario Kart series used to follow until Mario Kart DS (where courses from older games were brought back and first put into a retro category). Considering that Mario Kart 64's digital price isn't too far from this DLC's cost, I'd say it's just like buying an oldschool Mario Kart! After all, it certainly is as much fun as such (though some of you may actually find it all even better)!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18SD6I0VJ6BKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JNOBP8#wasThisHelpful","R18SD6I0VJ6BKY","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since WarioWare decided to test out ability to tilt the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo seems to have since used this series as kind of a demonstration for what their newly designed game console could do. Just like WarioWare Touched showed off the two screens and stylus, Smooth Moves on the Wii explains that there's even more you can do with that fancy Form Baton you have in your hand. You could point and click with it, sure, but you could also use it as a weapon, a steering wheel, a method for you to nod your head, a dart, and the list goes on! Yep, this is another zany frantic entry in the WarioWare series alright!In typical WarioWare fashion, the objective of the game is to play through a bunch of few-second microgames a host character provides, and the minigames themselves will be all sorts of weird and entertaining. They often have you execute simple motions, but the Wii's motion controls do help this game benefit quite a lot, as many of the motions tend to indeed feel like you're part of the action on-screen. The setup for each minigame is always different and unique, and their conveyance is straight to the point. Pitch the ball! Pick up the phone! Fly! Shoot down a giant nose rock!If anything, the main game does tend to feel like it's over too quickly, but there's plenty of replay value to be had. There are full-length minigames such as Balloon Trip and Can Shooter that you can play until you lose and obtain your high score, as well as a selection of modes to play with friends and family! These can be microgame barrages players must clear to survive, or they can too be full-length minigames such as Bungee Buddies and even a very functional game of Darts (Which absolutely craps on Game Party's Darts)!Fun, fast, and high on humor, WarioWare Smooth Moves is a Wii game I can easily recommend to anybody that craves fun and humor. Just remember: Cans are your mortal enemies!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z1MOPEU3KPPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FQ9YB0#wasThisHelpful","R2Z1MOPEU3KPPZ","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Rock Band 4 destined to be released in a couple months, I figured that I may as well give my thoughts on Rock Band 3.......for the Nintendo DS! So not only do we have a Rock Band game on the PSP and a conversion of Lego Rock Band for the DS, but we also get a version of the numbered sequel on the go! While certain home-to-small-screen transitions of video games have been handled as half-hearted cash grabs, others give the handhelds a complementary experience, and that's exactly what Rock Band 3 provides.If you've played the other portable Rock Bands before, you'll know what to expect from this one. If not, don't worry; I got ya covered. Unlike the Guitar Hero games on DS, you don't need a peripheral to play this game, so not only is it less expensive to boot, but it can even be played on a Nintendo DSi or 3DS. Instead, you play using the DS's own buttons. The A, B, Y, and X buttons are all for hitting the notes (they are assigned to the specific colors of course). The unique difference (between consoles and DS anyway) is that you gain control of all four instruments, each with their own layouts of notes, and you must hop around to use them via the L and R buttons. To do well at earning stars on your performance, you must react quickly when one instrument's note layouts ends and another starts up next to you and keep hitting the notes without missing one for note streaks. And of course, the mic can be used to double your scores temporarily (a la Guitar Hero's Star Power)All things considered, the resulting rhythm gameplay is neat and addicting. Playing songs, especially on difficulties like Hard mode, make the game fast-paced and the combo-triggering can make for a good motivation to try and keep at it. The music selection amounts to a healthy 25 songs, and most of them are goodies I'd be happy to jam to. I actually like this game more than I do Lego Rock Band, because not only are the graphics much more interesting to look at, but what I wasn't so fond of in Lego was that you were able to stick with one instrument during gameplay, and if you do that, you'd just experience repetitive rows of notes throughout the song. Here, Rock Band 3 requires that you keep going and help the entire band stay on their feet, especially considering not taking part in the other note tracks would mean the other instruments may end up in desperate need to survive with the whole band. It keeps gameplay NOT repetitive by making use of all four note tracks instead of making that an option. And as far as I can tell, the campaign isn't rehashing songs as much as Lego Rock Band's.It's Rock Band on the DS made more fun than before, and for that I wholeheartedly recommend this game to rhythm game fans, and for those interested in playing a Rock Band game, but don't feel like going through the tedium and spending of buying each peripheral. It's inexpensive, portable, and a great play. Now if only there was a 3DS version of Rock Band 4.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X41OU9CUL6YT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003RS9MME#wasThisHelpful","R1X41OU9CUL6YT","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ever since I played the first Happy Feet game based on the movie for the Nintendo DS, I had the lowest expectations possible when deciding to play this one. However, while I won't ever bother watching Happy Feet Two in any sort of form, the video game tie-in toyed with those expectations constantly. This game was created by Wayforward, a development team known to make some pretty good games for cartoon shows and movies alike, as well as the now-well-known Shantae series. Despite that, though, I'd still hastily toss this one away.Happy Feet Two is a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer plagued by the many problems tolerable or better quality platformers tend to avoid; Mumble moves too slow, and there's no run button, the levels are dull and repetitive since they are structured similarly just with different layouts, slowdown can occur even when there's seemingly no reason why it should, the boss fights are utterly pathetic and drag for too long, and the secondary characters you unlock don't even do JACK because they can only be onscreen temporarily and when their times are up the camera focuses back on Mumble anyway!The game does try to spruce things up a LITTLE bit. After all, there is one level where you control krill, and there are a few times where the game transitions to sledding for the fun of it, but even then these don't detract from the fact that this game is one heck of a dirty stain among Wayforward's usual lineup of games.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17GYYMRWFIWRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053WVBGM#wasThisHelpful","R17GYYMRWFIWRB","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While Sonic has yet make a new appearance in the gaming industry since 2013's Sonic Lost World (I REFUSE to count the Sonic Boom games as pure Sonic titles because they are just licensed games to tie-in with the Cartoon Network show - Not unlike shows such as Spongebob or Adventure Time), there's always a great time to reflect on the Blue Blur's past, and Sonic Mega Collection Plus does a fantastic job of delivering the high-speed platforming action that true fans crave and then some! That is especially considering this version of the collection contains even more games the Gamecube counterpart lacks.The original Sonic trilogy that graced the Sega Genesis the same way Mario paved his way as Nintendo's mascot is here and very well accounted for! There is a reason why these games put Sonic on the map: They are incredibly FUN! Filled with vast and vastly gorgeous level designs, wise balance of speed and platforming, and iconic characters, Sonics 1 through 3 & Knuckles have often been considered by various people as some of the greatest platformers ever, and they practically guarantee the value for this compilation alone!Still, there's light to be shed on the other games in the roster; Sonic 3D Blast is no high-speed platformer, but it is a good game in its own right, as it provides an interesting combination of Sonic (albeit in an isometric perspective) and arcade classic Flicky (a little platformer where you fetch birds and take them to the exit door), whose Genesis port is unlockable in this collection along with the obscure Ristar. Sonic Spinball is a pinball game (Clearly) featuring Sonic as the ball, but the game isn't really that good, especially considering you have to use the flippers to make Sonic fly into particular spots that may be a chore to reach. Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, on the other hand, is a fun Sonic-ized version of Puyo Poyo, a classic puzzler from Japan.New to this Plus edition are six games from the library of the Sega Game Gear. Twelve of these were unlockable in Sonic Adventure DX, but here, half of those are available here by default (The other half being in Sonic Gems Collection). The Game Gear version of the original Sonic the Hedgehog is actually a pretty underrated gem, featuring totally different level designs and even new environments; the gameplay is a little more simplistic (No loop-de-loops for example), but the platforming is still there and it's still fun. Sonic Chaos and Sonic Blast try to act more like the Genesis titles, but they suffer from a few issues that may not make them as enjoyable; I still personally like them, but they won't be everyone's cup of tea. That statement DEFINITELY goes for Sonic Labyrinth and Sonic Drift. Sonic Drift is basically Pole Position with Sonic characters, and Sonic Labyrinth is just plain boring. Lastly, I don't understand why we need the Game Gear version of Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine here when we already have the Genesis game, which is the same game with better graphics and sound.Regardless of a few duds, though, Sonic Mega Collection Plus is a must-have for any Sonic fan or gamer that wishes to enjoy some Sonic games! There'll at least be a few games you'll enjoy in here, and that fact would already be worth the price of admission.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3321XPFX2E35M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002EJ8FC#wasThisHelpful","R3321XPFX2E35M","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite that the Batman Arkham series had made its debut by this point in time, Batman: The Brave and the Bold wears the style of an oldschool platform/beat 'em up hybrid. Based on the cartoon series, Brave and the Bold has you or you and a friend play as Batman and one of his amusingly dorky sidekicks (except for the elderly not-dorky in-universe inspiration for Batman's crime-fighting duties, Hawkman). The game is divided into four ""episodes""; each episode begins and ends with animated FMV footage looking just like the cartoon, and sets the tone for the game itself each time, which is nothing short of a psuedo-serious escapade with lighthearted humor sprinkling over the action.Truth be told, while the game is pretty arcade-like and straightforward for a retail Wii title, this game is actually pretty fun! Granted, the difficulty is clearly geared towards kids (if the infinite respawns and the fact that the goons generally don't put up a real fight), and the platforming can be rather basic at times, but what really makes this game shine is the presentation and combat. The game is coated with stylistically colorful graphics, almost identical to the cartoon's visuals, save for some 3D background elements. Along with that, there are a surprising amount of ways to beat up bad guys.Combos could range from being simple button-mashing punches, or you could uppercut, do stronger punches (albeit with a slight delay before executing them), grab and throw, etc. When you gain a huge-enough combo, you could pull off a special move that deals out a lot of damage, and there's even a feature that allows you to briefly call in a DC hero from the show to deal out some extra hurt. All that said, the fighting is hugely satisfying and does a great job of making the game for me. And while the game may be easy, there is a competitive element if you play with a friend, in which you'll both be scored against each other at the end of the level - Not unlike what Mario and friends have been doing lately.Overall, I had a good time playing through this game. It may not pack much of a challenge, but everything else checks out fine, and it'll definitely be a blast for kids that are fans of the Caped Crusader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZNF9RJ0U56F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003AMOKS8#wasThisHelpful","R2ZNF9RJ0U56F0","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Evidently, no one bothered to try and create a portable stellar experience for the Playstation 2 title, Legend of Kay. Now, I haven't played the console game, but if this is what I'll be expecting from the televised play, then the Wii U and Playstation 4 remasterings may as well be recalled and tossed in the trash. There is no effort made to even provide action in the gameplay! All you do is run and jump, searching around for the desired object or location of interest the on-screen arrow points the direction to. And since the environments have no real way to make one area stand out from the other, there'll even be times where the arrow points you right into a wall, and you have to figure out how to get around that wall. Why isn't there a map on the bottom screen instead of a picture of the land you're in? Why can I only attack by jumping on an enemy, if there are any? It's absolutely ridiculous, and it makes for one of the worst DS games I've ever played. I had more fun sliding downwards the icy mountains in HAPPY FEET for DS. Considering how horrible I thought that game was, that says a lot.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GZX04HCK2N5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DT158W#wasThisHelpful","R3GZX04HCK2N5F","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I like that Nintendo decided to freshen up the formula with Mario Party 9, many players still yearn for a good Mario Party that doesn't involve being forced to ride a car through a board that has a finish line; that is especially if the series could return to the charm and fun its second game provided (Mario Party DS comes close!). With the series's Wii U debut, Mario Party 10......does pretty much everything the same way its predecessor has, except there seems to be certain things subtracted during the process, which is NEVER a good sign for a sequel.Is it just me or has there been a lack of game modes in the series lately? The main game modes are the usual Party Mode, and newcomers Bowser Party and Amiibo Party. That's pretty much it, and the latter isn't even playable if you lack any Amiibo (which is an additional cost each figure by the way). Naturally, I haven't been able to try out that mode, but looking at some gameplay footage online, I don't think I've missed out on much.Bowser Party is the mode this game loves to emphasize on in the same way New Super Mario Bros. 2 loves to emphasize the fact that there are millions of coins you can collect. However, unless the person playing as Bowser is not as good at Mario Party as the opposing players, this mode is completely ONE-SIDED! Bowser constantly has the advantage here, because when it's his turn, he can use a handful of dice blocks at once and easily catch up to the players' vehicle. This causes a minigame to appear where the other players must dodge Bowser's attacks in various different ways, but if Bowser does well in this area, then those players don't even have a chance to begin with.Party Mode works exactly the way it did in Mario Party 9, except with a couple less boards...Seriously? What's this game's excuse, especially if all the boards have finish lines like last time? For those that haven't heard about Mario Party 9's style of play before, while Mario Parties 1-8 feature boards that loop around in elaborate circles with multiple paths, Mario Party 9 features boards that have an end, and the results are determined there.Along the way to the end, there are spaces with all sorts of features that, along with every player being stuck in a moving vehicle, makes it seem like as if luck plays a bigger role to determine one's victory more than skill ever could. Players gather Mini-Stars, but dice rolls (not just from you) and the events that the spaces landed on will cause will make or break those gains anyway. Mini-Stars could be handed over to someone else, tossed aside altogether, or gained, all at sporadic moments. Even when gathering Mini-Stars, it still doesn't feel as satisfying as collecting Stars or even Coins for that matter.The minigames are....well, they're Mario Party minigames. They're zany little competitions in undefined Mushroom Kingdom lands as always, to say the least, and this is the aspect where players utilize skill the most. Some of them might still be based on luck, but they still aren't that much worse than events that would occur on the board. One thing I like is that there aren't too many minigames that use motion controls, instead relying on traditional D-Pad/analog and buttons.All things considered, Mario Party 10 can still make for mindless fun, notably for those not looking for a legit skill-based competition. However, this simply isn't how Mario Party should be conceived, and it once wasn't. I personally think Nintendo should make Mario Party 11 a downloadable eShop game in the same kind of structure and charm as Mario Party 2, but with different boards, outfits, and of course minigames. That's it; that's all that really needs to be done. For now, we have a retail game with an underwhelming amount of features that pushes luck above all else. For a good multiplayer game with Mario and friends, go for the fantastic Super Smash Bros. or also-awesome Mario Kart 8. Or for a better Mario Party experience, you could obtain Mario Party 8 for play on Wii U or preferably Mario Party 2 via the Wii Shop Channel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27CQW95S4SA88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWG4HG0#wasThisHelpful","R27CQW95S4SA88","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"-I've recently gotten into college, and there's a gameroom with consoles like the Playstation 4 and Xbox One set up and ready to play; I'll finally get to play through games of those consoles! That said, here is a review for one of them.-As console generations continue onward, many gamers expect to witness new titles with groundbreaking boundary-setters that older game systems wouldn't be able to compete with. However, it seems that with every console launch, there will always be that exception that tends to just be there for the sake of having a simpler game pulled from the depths of a simpler time. In the Playstation 4's case, that would be Knack.Knack is a video game that is typically referred to as a platformer, but it's really more of a beat 'em up. As the title character, you run across various different environments with only jumping across gaps or higher platforms to worry about until the level blocks you from progressing any further so you can kill the enemies that stand in your way. You punch and thrash those enemies however you can, the door blocking you opens, and the formula repeats. I hear that this game was meant to be kind of a Crash Bandicoot game, and while I can believe it, I moreso believe that it's more like Crash of the Titans than along the lines of the original PS1 trilogy, except with better combat and more satisfying control, but less level design and more forgettable characters.If there's one thing that I can't help but cringe at, it's the story and characters that play their parts within it. With a game like this, a minimal storyline is all we really ever need, but instead this game goes full-blown cinematic every level, only to tell a plot about a tribe at war with humans and stuff. Knack is apparently not his own character, but rather is he just a (albeit scientifically crafted) tool for the humans to win this war against the tribe of creatures. On top of that, you'd think Knack would be a mute character like Crash always was, but instead he TALKS. In an ADULT MAN voice. THAT VOICE comes out of THAT ARTIFICIALLY CREATED GOLEM. What?!Painfully awkward design choices and lack of levels being levels aside, Knack is still a good time. Just don't expect your favorite platforming mascots to be disturbed in the middle of the night over this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EMMAEDUN8AHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGAA29M#wasThisHelpful","R1EMMAEDUN8AHH","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Believe it or not, despite the success and fandom that Adventure Time was showered with since its Cartoon Network debut, it didn't see a video game adaptation until two years later. Fortunately, the development team that took upon the idea of a game for the show was none other than Wayforward, who had worked on various other titles such as the Shantae series and the acclaimed DS retro revival that is Contra 4. Surely enough, these developers were reliable, and the final result ended up doing the cartoon justice.Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage (Yep, that's the real title!) is a platform game that is basically one giant homage of Zelda II for the NES, except much easier to actually play through. You control Finn the Human, and as him you run, jump, and use your fists or trusty sword to deal with pesky creatures that lurk around the levels. His shapeshifter talking dog friend, Jake the Dog, is also present and accounted for, but since he doesn't feel like moving around on his own, he rides in Finn's backpack and can be used for additional attacks or powers, Banjo-Kazooie-style. Outside the side-scrolling levels, you roam around in a top-down environment looking for places to go. You reach these places, you talk to townspeople or whoever else, and then accept their quests as you try conquering your overarching one.The plot in this game is more in line with a ""one-off"" kind of Adventure Time episode, in which the story is just exclusive to that episode and doesn't focus on a tale that would span an entire season. In this case, the Ice King, being the lonely old sap he is, decides to give Finn and Jake something to fight him about by taking their garbage and making crappy garbage princesses out of them to ""rescue"". Along the way, Finn and Jake also have to make some investigations, whether they be for a talking house's parasol aggressively taken away, or a search for Princess Bubblegum's pantyhose (No, seriously).Adventure Time's sense of humor varies, but for the most part, the show would hit the sweet spot and make me laugh often. That holds true for HIKWUSOG, albeit the dialogue is spoken through text instead of voice acting. Regardless, there are lots of funny lines within the writing, and there are a couple times where the humor is shown visually (Such as the big scary monster at the top of the hill - Those of you that played this part know what I'm talking about!) and hits hard! There are also various references to specific episodes (Donnie the obnoxious grass ogre, the thingy that copies Finn and Jake's movements, Finn's little robot ""son"", etc, all make an appearance in the game), and there are even a chunk of references to classic video games (""But enough talk! Have at you!"").The humor, plot, colorful graphics, and surprisingly radical soundtrack wouldn't really mean too much in a video game, though, if the gameplay weren't up to snuff. Fortunately, Wayforward contains experienced people, and they know their way around the platform genre; in fact, I think this game uses the same kind of engine as Shantae: Risky's Revenge. Finn is capable of doing plenty of moves; he can punch/swing his sword, do that in the air, a slide kick on the ground, have Jake pull a punch with his stretchy arm, and use him for abilities that would be unlocked as the duo make progress. It especially helps that Finn is ultimately satisfying to control, as the movement is precise and accurate all around!Not everything about the game is perfect, of course, hence my 4-star rating instead of a 5. While there is plenty to explore, and a healthy cast of characters and settings, the level designs can feel rather bare at times. Not exactly in terms of the obstacles you face, but it feels more like as if the game is playing things too straight; the levels don't ever gain an over-the-top feel like the varied courses in games like DuckTales or the Super Mario Bros. sequels. Also, the quests are mostly fetch quests, which can be somewhat of a letdown for certain people out there...Not really me, personally, but it does get a bit tedious as I keep going further down the line.Nevertheless, Adventure Time's video game debut is a solid one. It may not be better than some other games Wayforward has created, but it certainly is great for a game based off a Cartoon Network show, as well as one of the better DS titles released nearly at the end of the library's lifecycle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLTR3WD9VE81C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RRFX4M#wasThisHelpful","RLTR3WD9VE81C","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After having two critically acclaimed puzzlers dominate over consoles and PCs, the Portal franchise has been around some rather strange whereabouts lately. We first hear that the LEGO take on the Skylanders toy-to-life formula will be bringing Portal into their mix of licensees, and now we suddenly have Zen Studios providing mobile devices with a Portal pinball game! But you know what? I totally welcome this stuff, especially this. For just two dollars, you get a mix of pinball goodness and Portal's atmosphere and sense of humor!The Zen Pinball game engine is indeed in effect here, as the mechanics are pretty solid, and the pinball play in general is as fun and addicting as pinball usually is. You don't really have to be a Portal fan to enjoy this game, but it does help considering you get quite a few snarky lines from antagonist GLaDOS, and there is some fanservice spread around the virtual table.

"While good ol' Crash Bandicoot has expanded his horizons on the Playstation 2 and Xbox, Vicarious Visions seems to have decided to hold back for the marsupial's then-latest Game Boy Advance title, Crash Purple. On the surface, it seems like it would be a pretty epic crossover between Crash and Spyro; after all, the two have been seen as partners/rivals ever since they gained dominance over the Playstation as unofficial mascots. Unfortunately, what we're provided with here is not anything that a regular Crash Bandicoot platformer can't triumph over...because platforming is not this game's ideal gameplay.Crash Purple is a collection of minigames that consist of various different gameplay styles, such as hopping on crates, riding to the goal, jet tubing, navigating via tank, etc, while the usual platforming formula is demoted to glorified HUB worlds. Yes, this is what the formation of a Spyro and Crash crossover has led up to. To be fair, though, a lot of the minigames aren't half-bad. They all have an emphasis on arcade-style mechanics and simplicity, basically serving as bite-sized levels that happen to shift between different types of gameplay. That said, you better make sure you get all the Crystals (by beating the minigames) and Gems (by smashing all the crates in the minigames), because unlike the previous GBA Crash games where you just get a not-so-ceremonious ending without collecting them, this game WILL NOT let you progress to the final part without them.What also helps add to this cartridge is that, just like the GBA version of Crash Nitro Kart, there's a hidden minigame that is accessed by holding L and R while booting up the game. That minigame is called Spyro Party USA, which is literally Crash Party USA from Nitro Kart, except with Spyro dancing onscreen instead of Crash. Nevertheless, it's a simple and fun rhythm game with addictive qualities to it such as the Crash-esc music enhanced by electronic beats, and the nature of the rhythm genre in general.As for Crash Purple as a whole? It's a fun game, but I personally prefer its predecessors if you want a great Crash experience on the go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY0AKV81PAON3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001CJEEA#wasThisHelpful","RY0AKV81PAON3","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's something that needs to be said about Pac-Man's inclusion in the new Super Smash Bros. game. Being that Namco was helping out in the game's development, I was hoping the yellow muncher would show up on the roster as soon as the game started counting off the newcomer trailers. After months and months of waiting, with no sign of Pac-Man anywhere, I thought to myself ""Sigh...I guess it wasn't meant to be...Even then, they'd probably use that stupid Ghostly Adventures design"". And then out of nowhere, a friend of mine showed me a trailer where Pac-Man made it in after all, and my jaw dropped. They beat the odds! Pac-Man's in Smash! He looks better than ever, and it's the REAL Pac-Man! And when I finally got to play as him in the game, I was wowed by how great he felt to control and how much love and detail was put into his inclusion.I guess beneath all that rambling, what I'm trying to say is - The Pac-Man I know still has the same kind of appeal that Mario still enjoys for decades on end. That Pac-Man led a creative series of games that all had real effort and care implemented in at least most of them. In comparison, Ghostly Adventures makes Pac-Man feel dead and beaten. I thought I'd relate to the characters a little more considering this variation takes place in a high school setting, but it turns out that these characters are just the usual lazy children's cartoon stereotypes that plague equally lame children's cartoons.As for the Ghostly Adventures video game....I've said everything I needed to say about that one. That's why I'm surprised Namco decided to follow it up so quickly with a sequel. But hey, who knows? Maybe they fixed everything that was wrong with the original game and/or made elements better and more fun to play with. After all, this Nintendo 3DS version is actually a port of the console game this time around, so maybe I can expect some real change.But NOPE - This game does everything the same way as it did when it was called ""Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures"" in the year 2013.Granted, there's slightly better shooting segments that pop in every now and then, and there are new power-ups, but those are just things that are there to only SEEM like they spruce up variety. The music isn't the utterly forgettable orchestra heard before, but instead it's utterly repetitive soft electronic music. Voice acting is still as horrible as before, and like last time, there's an option to mute only the voices. The graphics are......meh. They are visuals. There's scenery. It's not a bad looking game, but it sure is tastelessly bland. In fact, the framerate has the potential to kill all visual appeal; the game runs choppily at not even 30 FPS.Even if you do get past that, though, the gameplay is still boring. I mean, the control is fine, and Pac-Man's attacks and powers do work, but the level designs make the entire adventure feel soulless. There's NOTHING interesting about anything that happens, other than what the power-ups can do, but even then, they're only there just so you can make progress in the level, and not because the power-up would be fun to use by itself. It's all note-by-note by-the-numbers platforming without bells nor whistles. Unless if you count the bad voice acting.Do yourself a favor; if you own a Wii (or Gamecube/Playstation 2/Xbox), grab a copy of Pac-Man World 2. It's a platforming game, too, except it's my personal favorite Pac-Man game that's not from the arcades. THAT'S how great that game is.If you own a Wii U though, that's okay, because Namco Museum Megamix (if you don't already own Remix) will also provide an excellent Pac-Man experience thanks to the much-improved port of Pac 'n Roll included in there, among many arcade classics and remixed games.DO NOT buy this or the previous Ghostly Adventures game. Neither one provides an enjoyable experience, especially not one that's nearly as fun as the games I've mentioned above. Now if you excuse me, I'm going to resume Smashing it up with Pac-Man!","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HGBYTESBEZR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXDJTMK#wasThisHelpful","R3HGBYTESBEZR9","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I never gave anything too much thought after watching YouTuber Caddicarus's game review on Nothing Can Stop Mr. Domino a good while back, but after a casual browsing through games for the Wii, I came across this title, and my eyes lit up. After glancing at the boxart and some screenshots, I was curious and I went to Gamestop to buy the game for $3. Despite dominoes being featured on the box, Domino Rally really isn't related to the Playstation 1 title at all. Nevertheless, it's worth looking into.The first thing about the game that almost instantly came to mind was its style. I'm really surprised this wasn't a Japan-only game, because the localization is shockingly minimal; there are Japanese words with plain English captions at the bottom during cutscenes (although English-speaking voice actors dub over the characters), the music in every level contains lyrics sung in Japanese, and the game is generally REALLY weird and off the wall in a good way!Story doesn't play the biggest role in the game's focus, as each of the eight levels in the game have their own little conflict for protagonist Minon to solve. For example, the first stage has him recover a little girl's balloon stuck in a tree, the third stage has him answer a family man's phone so he can win a trip to Hawaii, and the sixth stage has him running across zoo animals to keep them quiet so a male elephant can confess his love for a female elephant. The cutscenes are just as brief and charmingly kooky.Really, this is more about doing these bizarre tasks than it is about dominoes (which is probably why this game's Japanese title doesn't mention dominoes); Minon putting down a line of dominoes for him to walk/run across (or using certain surroundings as such) is the only real connection. However, that's actually only the surface of the gameplay. You see, not only do you point at the screen and press B to put down and add to the domino lines, but Minon has only so many dominoes to put down. You have to use your surroundings to your advantage, recharging your ammo of dominoes by shaking the Wii Remote when using the scenery to run upon. It also helps Minon to run faster. There will also be a couple instances where Minon has to run across living beings to calm them down, so you must figure out how to manage your domino placements to your advantage in those situations.The game is somewhat tricky to learn at first, but once you get past the learning curve, you'll find Domino Rally to be good quirky fun while it lasts! It's kind of a real shame that it's tucked away in obscurity, as its upbeat Japanese charm is hard to dislike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GGTCFIC5BB43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0029MAXOK#wasThisHelpful","R1GGTCFIC5BB43","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Believe it or not, this is actually a home port of the original Street Fighter. Street Fighter I. The predecessor to Street Fighter II. The birth of a fighting game empire. Why am I emphasizing on this so much? BECAUSE THIS FIRST GAME IS ABOMINABLE!! It's honestly amazing how there could be such a great fighting game franchise spawning from something as bad as this game turned out to be, but it's true. If the Street Fighter games that followed afterward are so much fun to play, though, what makes this such a flop, you may wonder? Well let me explain...To be fair, the graphics are pretty good for late 80s standards (especially considering how dominant the NES graphical style was then), and the CD-quality soundtrack is a big improvement over the Genesis-y sounding music from the arcade cabinet, but everything else about the game falls flatter than the floor. The voice samples, for instance, are hilariously muffled and are just barely intelligible when reading captions. Other oddities such as the black screens for announcing rounds are awkward in comparison to just simply having the fighters stand for a moment before the announcer says to fight. Ryu and Ken are also the only playable fighters, unfortunately. And then there's the control...Oh dear Lord the control...When you think of a game made by Capcom, it's bound to have tight control, right? Well, Fighting Street's controls are utterly BROKEN! There are severe delays for EVERY FRICKIN' MOVE YOU DO, your character jumps in such a clumsy diagonal angle, and I would LOVE to see if someone can pull off a Hadoken without mashing buttons for minutes on end before figuring out how to do it! The button combinations are as good as non-existent, but if you do somehow pull off a move like that, that move actually takes out more than half the opponent's health! Way to tease us with immense frustration, developers!Speaking of immense frustration, let's talk difficulty; if you thought having to constantly struggle with getting Ryu/Ken to execute the right attacks and maneuvers was bad enough, just wait til I discuss the AI! There are loads of computer players out to beat the crap out of Ryu or Ken, and they don't take it easy. As I was playing through the game, there was this one opponent that headbutted me twice, and apparently just those two hits were enough to kill me! THAT'S how cheap the game gets! And it's not like I could dodge quickly either; good control or not, you get ZERO reaction time for some of the enemies' attack patterns!Simply put: Be very, very, VERY thankful that the Street Fighter series you get to play is nothing like the game that paved the way for it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JGC5H561JCJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013IZFYE#wasThisHelpful","R1JGC5H561JCJL","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Genesis-exclusive sequel to the arcade classic, Golden Axe II plays almost exactly like its predecessor, but with new layouts and enemies to deal with. I'm not complaining, though; the beat 'em up gameplay of the original is back in full force here anyway! It's still a lot of fun to beat down the slew of incoming baddies with either my weapon or an animal I can ride. It's especially satisfying to have them tossed into bottomless pits or killing giant boss enemies!Returning from the Genesis version of Golden Axe is The Duel, which turns this game into a fighter where you fight one enemy, and move on to the next one (or ones?) after claiming your victory over that enemy. It's an interesting, fun take on the beat 'em up formula that serves to add to the overall package. And I believe it does that fine.If you've played through the first Golden Axe, you won't have any trouble playing through this one as well, but you'll at least still have fun doing so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KV8UCRRTNAIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000035XJD#wasThisHelpful","R3KV8UCRRTNAIG","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not saying that video games shouldn't at all contain cinematic experiences, but this is what I usually look for in a game: A colorful, fluidly playable, and thoroughly fun time whenever I pick up the controller. Donkey Kong Country Returns is a fantastic example of this, and it helps that it's a long-awaited sequel to the Super Nintendo trilogy that broke ground by combining SGI computer graphics with addictive platforming gameplay.  With that stuff in mind, Retro Studios had quite a bit to follow up to, but in my eyes, the result was beyond expectations!As the big ape himself, you run, jump, bop on enemies, and collect bananas as you race your way through each level in the eight worlds provided. The 2.5D structure is not unlike that of games like Nintendo's own New Super Mario Bros. Wii, but the execution makes all the difference, and Donkey Kong Country Returns manages to pull things off in a better fashion. This game doesn't play things safe; it brings out the big guns nearly every level! Everything is elaborate and pompous; from the absolutely gorgeous jungle scenery to the hidden collectibles and bonus rounds waiting to be found to the bosses and their patterns to the kooky barrel-riding and mine carts to even the many ultimately eventful ways Donkey Kong can finish a level! Not one detail is lacking!Diddy Kong joins in the fun as well, but in a slightly unusual way. In single-player, you can't really get to play as him, but you CAN use his jetpack, as it can allow you to hover briefly, making for some pretty sweet jumps! Furthermore, while the Super Nintendo games have alternative and competitive 2-Player modes, Donkey Kong Country Returns allows a friend to join in the main adventure at the same time! Cooperatively! In this day and age where online multiplayer has taken the industry by storm, sharing the same couch is still a blast, and games like these prove it.With or without a friend, though? Don't expect this one to be a walk in the park. Believe it or not, the Donkey Kong Country series has been known to be rather challenging at times, and Returns makes it pretty darn clear this time around! It's not like Mario where you have a good chance of simply breezing through. You'll be losing a good number of lives! Possibly per level later on! And the clever level design will make sure that you should stay on your toes. Fortunately, gathering up lives and other kinds of help won't be a problem because Cranky Kong hosts a shop.Throughout each level, there are Banana Coins you can collect. They're obviously not in in-your-face locations as bananas are, but collecting them allows you to purchase things from Cranky's shop. Among them are extra lives which can be bought off with these Banana Coins. So this allows you to rack up the lives to dozens upon dozens pretty easily! As challenging as the game is, though, the overall product is top-notch and filled with fun and excitement! Probably the most difficult part of the game is thinking of how I could complain about it! I'm serious!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GPXJAOV4W340/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZHMMEM#wasThisHelpful","R2GPXJAOV4W340","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nintendo may have had an awesome 2014, but this is one of the couple games that shouldn't have worked out in that favor. From the moment I laid my eyes on the first trailer for Yoshi's New Island, I was unimpressed to say the least. The pre-rendered graphic look didn't fit well, making the scenery and characters look slightly muddy (Which is very ironic considering Shigeru Miyamoto didn't want the original YI to have pre-rendered graphics), and the giant Shy Guy and egg looked like it's only there just for the sake of there being a giant Shy Guy and egg and not for unique design aspects. I've skipped out on this game for a good while now, but recently, my little brother obtained the last Platinum award from Club Nintendo. Since we already have the better selections from there, the closest thing my brother got to being a new pick we could enjoy was Yoshi's New Island. Unfortunately, the game was exactly as I expected. And the trailer didn't set my expectations radically high.First and foremost, let's address the music for one quick second because that's the first thing that pops into my mind when thinking about this game and when the title screen appears: I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS SOUNDTRACK! It's bland, it's boring, it's repetitive, it has no right to be remixed throughout the game, and the kazoos give my ears nightmares! I could make better music with my own vocals!Anyway...Yoshi's New Island is the THIRD Yoshi's Island game in the series, but it seems to try and act like a SECOND game, as if it tries to ignore that Yoshi's Island DS existed. Rather than make its own storyline about babynappings like that game did, New Island decides to piggyback ride on the Super Nintendo classic's story, and shove it straight into a pig shredder! The soft, warm ending of the original game gets shockingly butchered for the introduction, and the narrative from then until the beginning of the game is informal, clashing with how Yoshi's Island usually tells the story.After that rocky intro, the game at least plays like a Yoshi's Island game. You're Yoshi with Baby Mario strapped to your back, and you must go venture around in colorful landscapes and face off a variety of enemies by throwing eggs and eating them to make more eggs. For the most part, the play style at its core is pretty unharmed, which is easily the best thing I can say about the game. Yoshi's Island's style of play has always been very fun, and it's great to at least see this game carry that gameplay. What bothers me, though, is that Yoshi can't transform into something by popping a bubble; instead, you must go through a trippy door, which completely separates the level from the segment Yoshi's transformation is in, and you must control him via tilting the 3DS. Why am I forced to interrupt my platforming level to do something completely unrelated to said platforming level? The tilting control even applies for Yoshi's old transformations, so if you expected to roam freely with the Yoshicopter or submarine like in the first game, prepare to be disappointed.In fact, one of my biggest problems with Yoshi's New Island (aside from the music) is what I've somewhat slowly noticed throughout my time playing the game; the game subtracts from miscellaneous content from its predecessors. Any variety that was brought into Yoshi's Island DS is nowhere to be found here, as this game wants to mimic the Super NES title, except it doesn't even address everything! Where are the Fuzzies that make you dizzy? The Baseball Boys? The Bandit minigames for extra rewards? The bonus chances at the goal when the roulette selects a Flower? The various objects that originally used Mode-7 for 3D display but would look great in 3D here? THEY AREN'T HERE!!! Any enemies and additional gimmicks that DID make the transition to this game were moved to later worlds or levels. If that weren't enough, the level design is actually simplified - Sometimes, I hopped and/or ran across the terrain, not getting attacked, without a second thought. And most of the time, before I knew it, I suddenly made it to the goal quicker than I thought I would. This isn't the original Super Mario Bros. This is YOSHI'S ISLAND! Both Yoshi's Island and its DS sequel were filled to the brim with elaborate and challenging level designs. What the heck happened here?This even applies to the boss battles. Kamek, for some reason, has to be the boss in every fourth level of each world. While the battle has decent variations, the overall result is still easy and doesn't give off an impression. The #-8 boss battles do a better job, but they still lack the charm and memorability of the older games' bosses. Baby Bowser felt like a slap in the face, to tell you the truth, because he was pathetically easy to defeat (His changing up the height of floor structures didn't even do a thing against me). So I thought, anyway, before the game's ending psyched me out by calling in-GROWN UP BOWSER?! Yes, that's right folks - We have unnecessary time travel in the game, and in order to get to defeat Bowser to get the best ending, you must complete every level without using wings. Or as I like to call them, the ""You Suck Wings"".The You Suck Wings are this game's way of telling you you died too many times in a level, to carry on the tradition that New Super Mario Bros. Wii shouldn't have started and that games like Super Mario 3D Land shouldn't have continued using. Don't get me wrong; the game is very easy and hardly ever picks up the challenge one bit. I guess I just failed to try on a couple parts and decided to use the wings to scrape by.Look. If you haven't played any game in the series yet, and are looking for an enjoyable platformer on the 3DS, this really isn't a terrible pick. However, when comparing it to Yoshi's Island and Yoshi's Island DS, it can only be seen as a massive downgrade. I think I'd like to talk about Donkey Kong Country Returns for a bit as an example of a sequel to an old game done right; everything the game does builds upon what the original Super NES trilogy set up, from the elaborate environments and smart level designs to the downright epic boss battles and combining remixed nostalgic music with new original music that equally sounds great. In fact, I bet if Retro Studios developed Yoshi's New Island instead of Arzest, this game would've been made with as much heart and effort as Nintendo themselves put into the original Yoshi's Island. For the sake of playing something better, I can't say I recommend this game over the other Yoshi games (including Yoshi's Story) at all. It's a misstep in what's otherwise a fantastic year for Nintendo.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34L6OAN05J7AV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DC7G3Q8#wasThisHelpful","R34L6OAN05J7AV","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After debuting on the bigger screen, Kirby hops back over to everyone's favorite monochrome handheld! This time, he's bringing pretty much everything he's learned from his last adventure and then some. Kirby's Dream Land 2 takes the concept of making things bigger and better and takes it to the extreme, particularly considering how short the first game is. While Dream Land 1 lasts five stages (the last stage being a mish-mash of the other four), Dream Land 2 follow's Kirby's Adventure's concept on having Worlds divided into levels, immediately making for a bigger game!Expanded as it is, though, the game never loses a drop in quality because nothing is simply padded out for status quo. All of the levels Kirby ventures through are populated with fun level designs and enemy variety. The enemy variety absolutely helps Kirby out in this case because he can now suck them up with that giant mouth of his and absorb enemy powers to his benefit! First appearing in Kirby's Adventure, this feature absolutely helps give Kirby a defining mechanic, and it's always a thrill to tinker with the various ways Kirby can kill enemies and work his way through the stage! Even more so when Kirby equips an animal buddy!Presentation-wise, the game is still very sound. Oddly, the composers seem to have actually toned down the rapid upbeat style of the usual Kirby soundtrack, save for any songs reused from the original Dream Land. The music is still good stuff, but it just seemed rather jarring to me. The graphics are far more consistent, as it shares the same pompous graphics that the first game proudly boasted. In fact, there seem to be some extra details lying around in all those pixels.Gorgeous-looking, great-sounding, and all-out awesome to play, Kirby's Dream Land 2 is a Game Boy gem that makes its portable predecessor look like a demo!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34BAQILHMW22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002SVEV#wasThisHelpful","R34BAQILHMW22","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dreamworks Super Star Kartz is an interesting case in a way; it was originally going to be a reboot/remake of Crash Team Racing, but for whatever reason, Activision canceled the game before even looking over its prototype. High Impact Games, however, did rework their sadly abandoned project into a new game: One where ogres, aliens, and zoo animals race together! So technically it did in fact see the light of day, just not in a fashion that's connected to Naughty Dog's farewell to Bandicoot lovers everywhere.A mishmash of Dreamworks licensees and Mario Kart, Super Star Kartz features an all-star cast racing in go karts on courses inspired by their respective movies. As you can expect in every race, items will be thrown around like there's no tomorrow, drifting will be a powerful tool for boosting, and ramp stunts and special moves also come into play for the drivers' benefits. There are four cups with three tracks in each, with the last cup consisting of reversed variations of three existing tracks.While the game does also seem somewhat rough around the edges, the zany racing action is actually pretty solid for a game that's not a direct copy of Nintendo's flagship mascot racer. Granted, Mario Kart is the source of inspiration for pretty much every other kart-racer out there, but Dreamworks Super Star Kartz evidently provides the same kind of bouncy and tight kart movement that Crash proudly boasted way back when (although not to the same degree, as this game can still be kinda loose in comparison), and the item selection does a decent job of getting brief chaos done.The graphics may be far from the best I've ever seen on Wii, but the courses do show a nice amount of detail and eye candy, which include but aren't limited to things like the flying dragons in Berk, as well as Susan and Insecto roaming a city in the background of the spaceship track. The music is....well, music, but the voice clips could have used some work; the substitute voice actors don't provide the same charm as the movie voice actors, and the clips recorded are repeated too often.But all in all, Dreamworks Super Star Kartz is a solid kart-racer for the Nintendo Wii. It doesn't beat out Crash Bandicoot's karting forays, nor would it ever step on Mario's shoes, but you can still have a good time from it if you're looking for, well, a kart-racer to enjoy, and if you're a fan of the movies represented here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ICJ8P41V4C8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GM3MX4#wasThisHelpful","R2ICJ8P41V4C8E","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game threw me off my guard by total surprise, but not really in that good of a way. At first, Putter Golf does exactly what you expect it to do: Provide a decent miniature golf experience on the original Playstation. The courses can be pretty fun, and there is even a selection of courses with unique little gimmicks. When playing alone, however, as soon as the CPU begins its turn, that's where the game's biggest flaw comes into play. For some odd reason, no matter what difficulty you select, the CPU player ALWAYS gets either a Birdie or a Par. Take a good guess which one the CPU scores more.Putter Golf will likely be a much better time if you have someone to play with, so you can actually have a legitimately fair game. But unless you're a pro at this game, and can always score a Birdie or higher, then you may as well stay away from the single player modes.

"Beat 'em ups don't seem to be as common on mobile as they should have been, but Fist of Awesome helps feed my cravings for one, and for the most part, it did them justice. This is a button-masher (er...screen-masher) to the purest degree; you move to an enemy, and beat the everloving crap out of him! The retro-tastic graphical style and excellent music definitely give this game a great flavor, but this would have been a total five-star extravaganza if there was more variety. The enemies all play out the same way, and the game should TMNT-ize the levels by providing level elements that serve as unique obstacles or at least interactive decorations beyond reading or talking to stuff. Other than those things, though, this is a pretty good game, and it's worth your time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AU07L4A3EU31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQU7MCI#wasThisHelpful","R1AU07L4A3EU31","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Retro and addictive, League of Evil is a fantastic and neatly crafted mobile platformer! The game is divided into four worlds (not counting the bonus ""Impossible"" or ""Lite"" worlds), and each one lasts around dozens of bite-sized levels. What do you do in each level? Run, dodge, kick attack, and get rid of those evil scientists at the end! The platforming is top-notch, as you have just the right control over the protagonist, as well as a variety of moves; he can double jump, wall jump, and do an air kick. And despite the levels being short, this game will last a good while thanks to the overall world length and the increasingly difficult challenges you face as you progress. Topped with excellent 16-Bit-ish graphics and a radical 8-Bit-ish soundtrack, League of Evil is a must-own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IEOZCSIMQJWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009JNXK88#wasThisHelpful","R3IEOZCSIMQJWZ","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ever since its jump to another company's arms, Crash Bandicoot has been degraded from a wacky marsupial with attitude to a hobo-like creature with a whiny voice. While I'm not too fond of Crash's new character design, Crash of the Titans is actually not too bad of a game. At least not for the Nintendo DS. It's a 3D platformer with a linear perspective that's almost exactly like that of Naughty Dog's PS1 trilogy (complete with a few 2D sections and bonus areas). However, there's still a lot to be desired.Yes, the platforming does feel pretty good, and Crash's fighting moves aren't too shabby, but the level designs are blander than they should have been. There are a bunch of boxes to smash up, and there are collectables, but there is a major lack of any sort of real punch that the older games have been peppered with. Instead, the focus is almost solely on the combat, which isn't too bad, but if you're going to make this a platforming game, you may as well put effort into those aspects, too.That said, the combat's okay. It can be ultimately satisfying to beat the crap out of an enemy, and it's even better when you get to hijack an enemy and use him for your own benefits. To the game's credit, it does get more strategic as to which enemy to take over, and some of the moves are pretty cool to unleash. It would have been nice if there were more fighting sound effects, though. Your normal hits are near-silent.Lastly, there's the matters of the overall presentation, and even that, like all else I mentioned, is a mixed bag. The game does show polish in some areas, but not in others. There are a decent amount of cutscenes with fully-voiced dialogue, but the writing tries too hard to land a joke (going as far as to have a laugh track for the supposedly funny lines spoken). The graphics look remarkably great for a DS title, but the music is considerably average and pales in comparison to the catchy and fun tracks of its predecessors. There's definitely some good things about this game, while there's also things about it that should have been improved on. If you're curious, and/or are a Crash Bandicoot fan, there is some fun to be had, but don't have high hopes for it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VVSBF8FDWHKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SMM40O#wasThisHelpful","R3VVSBF8FDWHKC","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you thought nothing but arcade-style games could be accomplished with squares and rectangles for graphics, prepare for a title that would single-handedly blow your mind; Thomas Was Alone is a platformer featuring multicolored shapes, and you solve loads of clever and fun puzzles along the way to beat the levels. Shockingly, however, the interesting gameplay isn't the only thing that makes this game an absolute gem among the millions of apps. What helps the game find itself is its sound department.Topped with atmospheric music, Danny Wallace tugs on emotions with a strong narration constantly throughout the entire game. The square shapes are each given unique personalities, and a series of events complement each one's actions that YOU control and NOT watch cutscenes to see unfold. The curious and observant square, Thomas, meets with short orange square Chris, who is at odds with Thomas, but they both meet up with more characters together including Claire, who wants to be a superhero, and John, a yellow rectangle wanting to show off his impressive jumps. There are eleven chapters in this game, and the story introduces a new character every chapter. The result is the most powerful story one can ever experience with such simple graphics. Seeing that this story is deeper than many, many big-budget games is just a bonus!If you pass on this game, you are doing yourself a major disservice; Thomas Was Alone is probably one of the best Android games I've ever played.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSE1M7I6Q43BV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LXFHI60#wasThisHelpful","RSE1M7I6Q43BV","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Believe it or not, Mario is no stranger to pinball tables, but there has never been a pinball video game starring the plucky plumber. Well, the good news is that there was a development team that realized this, and has put this out for the good ol' Game Boy Advance. Unfortunately, the team might have been too small to work with such a big Nintendo property. While Mario Pinball Land/Super Mario Ball does hold a lot of promise, the problems are few yet incredibly major.The game mashes up the pinball style of play with a Super Mario 64 structure; collect Power Stars by slinging Mario as a ball into enemies and grabbing keys by defeating bosses. On paper, the concept is really good. However, here's the major flaw: Navigation. In order to get anywhere, you must use the flippers to fling Mario to doors and paths, which is EASIER SAID THAN DONE. It's not like in any Mario platformer where you can just move him with the analog stick to that door. Oh, no. Here, you have to hope Mario rolls down to the direction the door's located! There are numerous instances where Mario would hit the door open, but then constantly miss the opened path. Or maybe Mario would hit something else by accident and trigger more frustration. He could hit paths that I don't want to go to. And this problem is worsened during missions where you must hit enemies in specific ways (such as hitting snakes before they go the manhole in the middle, or hitting Shy Guys to change their color - all Shy Guys onscreen must be the same color)! Heck, maybe the problem wouldn't be as jarringly apparent if the pinball physics were completely accurate. But they aren't; they are surprisingly unreliable for a Nintendo-published game.It's not like no one made an effort to make this game good, though. There is a lot of positive weight to this, too; the music is appropriately catchy and has the typical repetitions of a Mario soundtrack, and the graphics are actually some of the best the Game Boy Advance has to offer. The pinball mechanics also do have their merits, since it IS, well, pinball, and you could even use a few items to help a little. It's just a big shame the physics haven't been tweaked up enough and navigation isn't any easier. The bosses justify this even further, especially Bowser. You just had to hit them a few times and they're dead, but Mario's bound not to hit them when you need him to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FAYKMU4UJM3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002HDSZ0#wasThisHelpful","R1FAYKMU4UJM3M","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those few games that I pick up from Gamestop for as low as ONE DOLLAR, and yet I spend the day wondering why the game is this disposable. On top of that, while a lot of rhythm games tend to center around just a gameplay mechanic (which isn't bad at all, mind you), there are some out there that go beyond the call of duty and provide not only said mechanic, but also their own charming characters and settings like any other genre could. This jovial entry, for example, made an impression on Dreamcast gamers in 2000, and now eight years later, Nintendo fans get to join the party without purchasing expensive maracas!What makes Samba De Amigo tick is its emphasis on motion control. Granted, motion control isn't the most reliable feature you could implement in a Wii game, and there are even a few times where the control could feel imprecise, but it otherwise works pretty dang well here! Using the Remote and Nunchuck as maracas, you rhythmically shake them as you point them up, down, or in the middle, and the result works great! And it certainly helps that the large 40+ song soundtrack is full of great choices!From Mambo Number 5 to Low Rider to Tango With Me, the selection of songs is surprisingly varied, and while the dancing scenery may not get nearly as much attention as the six spots on the interface, it sure does reflect the pompous energy that flows throughout the game. That too also varies as you play different songs, as you can see Samba dancing with other dancers such as Rio, Linda, and even Sonic and Ulala make cameo appearances as dancers! Apparently, they have great taste in Latin-esc music.Music gamers everywhere need to pick this one up. Considering how cheap it is now, there's no excuse! It has all the colorful dazzles of a mascot game, as well as the uniquely fantastic formula rhythm games usually contain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZM6EM0TM1SGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XZZ8C2#wasThisHelpful","RZM6EM0TM1SGO","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It doesn't have the robust levels and epic chiptunes of the classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games, but this Android game based off the movie is actually pretty good! The game is based all around touch screen-based combat (similarly to Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword for the Nintendo DS), and the game pulls that off nicely, if not slightly loose in comparison to that title. Nevertheless, it has its addictive quality, and the beat 'em up aesthetics do hearken back to the Turtles' glory days in video games. I'd say this is well worthy of your four bucks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V2YND0U98WRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0C56R8#wasThisHelpful","R2V2YND0U98WRA","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Formerly an unofficial mascot of Sony, Crash Bandicoot makes his way towards multiple game consoles like certain former mascots before him, but in the hands of different development teams this time. In this case, Traveler's Tales has whipped up Wrath of Cortex. While this may seem like a drastic change from the original Playstation, this game actually follows the footsteps of its Naughty Dog predecessors; you run forward/right, collect peaches and a Crystal in each level, break boxes, hit bonus rounds for more peaches and 1-Ups, etc.With that said, the platforming is addictive as it has always been! There's something about the simple run 'n jump style of play Crash offers that keeps me hooked. Box-smashing and collecting peaches always feels good to do, and the action can be constantly kinetic for the most part. This formula alone just makes the game a winner in my opinion. However, there is a doze of other gameplay styles serving as other levels, but while a couple are pretty good, the other couple aren't as satisfying. The Marble Madness-style levels are a treat, and the plane combat levels at least control nicely, but levels such as the kart-racing (ironically).......suck. The bosses aren't really much to write home about, either.But with lush colorful worlds, a catchy and vibrant soundtrack, and addictive gameplay, Crash Bandicoot: Wrath of Cortex is fully recommended for fans of the little guy's previous platforming conquests. It might not be as on par, but it's still fun to play regardless!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CLDQVFXCGND0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006966U#wasThisHelpful","R1CLDQVFXCGND0","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've gushed over this game a number of times on my review of the console/PC versions, and now that there is a portable edition that I can take with me on my 3DS, how could I possibly say ""No""?! Now, this 5-Star rating isn't actually for everybody to follow; if you own a PS Vita, skip this and grab a copy of Rayman Origins for that handheld instead; as far as I can tell, it's a perfect direct port of the big-screen counterparts. This port has a number of small-to-moderate technical issues; the frame rate's cut in half, there's no multiplayer, the music isn't as crisp, and there are even a few times where the music halts to the sound of nothingness. Regardless, if you own a 3DS, and want to play this fantastic game on the go, then it's worth your time and money.As for the game itself, Rayman Origins bursts with superb level design, colorful graphics, and a vibrant and catchy soundtrack! Although the 3DS version may not have the super-smooth 60 FPS of the console game, the visuals still impress me, as the entire game looks like a lush cartoon, and goes as far as to play like one, too!The gameplay is initially pretty simple: You run, jump, and collect shiny yellow Lums. However, like any great game, you will be introduced to more powers such as punching, gliding, and even running on walls! The levels reflect upon these cool abilities you obtain as the game progresses, and they're full of some of the best platforming challenges out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26J7D42OCJJHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PTR0XO#wasThisHelpful","R26J7D42OCJJHE","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Years after the numbered sequel to what's considered to be one of the first ""modern"" rhythm games comes a game for the Nintendo Wii that sports the familiar art style and emphasizing for rhythmic play from the same developers. Unlike games such as Parappa the Rapper, though, Major Minor's Majestic March......is actually not good. I mean, there are some interesting things about it, and the gameplay does have the potential to be fun, but there's so much wrong with the game that the negatives outweigh the positives about it.If you enjoyed the fully animated cutscenes and fully casted voice talent of Parappa and UmJammer Lammy, prepare to be sorely let down; there's only ever two characters speaking (The narrator and ""G.G.G.G.""), and the narrator tells the story literally like a preschool children's book, with non-moving, still images onscreen in place of cutscenes. What happened? Was the budget too small?And then there's the tutorial, which can't be skipped, and moves slower than necessary....but that's all I can say about it. As for the actual game, again, it does have ingredients for a fun time, but everything else neglects those. At first, the game seems ungodly frustrating (more on that in the next paragraph), but if you take the time to learn it, you'll realize it's ungodly a CAKEWALK. The play mechanics consist of rhythmically waving the Wii Remote/baton up and down, while also pointing it at passers-by to force them into your marching band and power-ups which you can easily abuse to the point where you could probably spend 10% of the level actually doing the waving your Remote. There are power-downs that affect your party, but the power-ups can not only improve their stamina, but can also allow the game to take control from you and play itself for a brief moment of time......and these power-ups are very abundant.The control alone is partially an issue, because it involves the Wii motion control. On the surface, it does its job; you wave it and the game will react upon how you do it, but then there's the portions where the game wants you to change your tempo. EASIER SAID THAN DONE. When I try doing this, I end up getting distracted by whether or not I'm really shaking slower or faster, and I would never know how to rebalance until I take a moment to regain my initial stance. To come to think of it, I think this game would work better as a Nintendo DS game; the stylus would make for an easier approach and better responsiveness. The game also just needs to improve literally everything else.I would also like to point out that there are a couple of whole screens and stuff in this game that are just extremely pointless to begin with. The bonus stage portion ""Drill Mode"", interrupts your game to make you waggle the Remote in various ways just for points. Because points reeeeaaaaally maatteeer (no they don't). And after each stage, the game asks ""Who's performance did you enjoy the most?"". Why does this matter? What difference does it make? All my band members take part in contributing to the melodies that will never stay in my head after a second.Yes, even the music is not good. In a rhythm game, that's a major blow. Even if some of the rhymes were somewhat corny, I always get a kick out of listening to the music from the Parappa games, because they're catchy and fun, and are part of the reason why I go back to playing them! Here? Monotonous marching band-ish music that I can't remember even during my play session with it. The only song that stood out was the ear-grating half-melody from Stage 6.I've been curious for a while as to why this game was poorly received, and even Rodney Greenblat, one of the creators of Parappa and this very game, was not satisfied with it. Now that I finally played it, I can totally see why; it truly is a mess.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSV3TGB6SUFR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001P2M50K#wasThisHelpful","RSV3TGB6SUFR5","A2TCG2HV1VJP6V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCG2HV1VJP6V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One thing I like the most is the adjustable strap at the top.  You simply pull it over through the loop and can adjust if you want it higher or lower.

"I got this product because I have difficulty using granulated fertilizers.  I always seem to get too much in one place and not enough in the other despite using the whirly thing to disperse it.  Here in California, water is pretty scarce, and if I overfertilize with the granulated products, I tend to burn my grass.  I tried this out last weekend in my backyard and it was a quick application.  I like how it went on evenly throughout the yard.  I waited a couple days to water per the feedback I have seen on the comments section, so as to not wash away the product. I water my yard for two minutes per section every other day and so far no burn spots.  I typically get weird clover-like clumps of hot pink flowers in my yard each spring and after dousing the patches where it tends to start, I have noticed that there has been little to no growth.  It did not seem to work well on the dandelions in my yard, but since there are few, I was not too worried.Because I have pets, I kept them inside until the fertilizer had dried as a precaution - I also do this when I spray for mosquitos.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27ODXBN577IVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LD2IK6#wasThisHelpful","R27ODXBN577IVG","ANOBZWKE25SBY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANOBZWKE25SBY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What an incredibly novel cover of a 60's classic tune.  I never liked the original song when it was performe by the Rhonettes's because I just don't care for the sound of the 60's motown music.But I neard this during the closing act of the TV show ""Stalker"" and was so intrigued by the etheral and haunting vocals that I had to seek it out.  It is just such a different sounding song - the vocals are really ethereal and evoke a completely different scenario than the original uptempo version.  I would love to find more stuff by this artist.  I love when artists cover material in a way that is so different than the original that a listener does not even realize that it is the same song.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD3JXK793J2B3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PUK72B0#wasThisHelpful","RD3JXK793J2B3","ANOBZWKE25SBY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANOBZWKE25SBY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a nightmare to install!  I am a visual learner, but there are no instuctions on how to install the software, so you need to download them first if you are visual like me.  The initial install took what seemed like forever but was actually about 25 minutes.  It failed and when I checked the Amazon site for recommendations, I noticed the review recommending that you not check for uodates.  It installed much quicker after that, and I also did not have any updates awaiting my attention, so that was kind of annoying.I am a Pinnacle Studio user, so I was really curious as to how this would work in comparison. The instructions for creating video slideshows is much easier and much more straighforward than with Pinnacle (I often have to refer back to notes with Pinnacle).

"Set in Regency England, Lady Sophia's parents are determined to marry her off to a duke. But Sophia, seeing how unhappy marriages tend to be amongst the gentry, is determined to marry a man who earns his own living rather than inherits it. So she elopes with George, a mere solider. But when Sophia discovers George is actually a rich duke, she is furious at him for lieing to her. Can their marriage be saved?At only 30 pages long, this book barely has enough time to set up the premise and conflict. There's about 28 pages of set up, and only 2 pages of resolution where Sophia and George have a happy ending. There is limited plot and zero character development. As the reader I felt no emotional connection to the characters. The premise was half way decent, and maybe if the story had been expanded upon into a novella length story, it might have been ok and I might have given it three stars. But in it's current state two stars is the best I can give. I can't believe the author would normally charge $2.99 for this short story that took me only fifteen minutes to read. It's not even worth 99 cents, and even for free I didn't enjoy it. Not a book I would recommend.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7UJDGKYTBYPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JB97BO#wasThisHelpful","R7UJDGKYTBYPU","ADQGVWIT520HG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQGVWIT520HG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To say this doll is gorgeous is an understatement. Her dress is breathtaking. Pictures don't do it justice. The dress is soooo poofy especially if you take the doll out of thr box. The skirt is covered in sparkles. The top of the dress is a soft velvet. Her shoes are silver high heels. Her face mold and makeup are perfect. She has real eyelashes. My only complaints are that her hair is too thin. You can actually see bald spots in the back. She also.doesn't come with a doll stand (which is weird because every other Disney limited edition doll comes with a stand). So if you want to display her outside of the box you have to find a doll stand that will fit. Also, her box shape is a bit weird aa it's nothing like previous LE doll box shapes which all match. Also the box isn't very sturdy.This doll is special in that she was released for Disneyland' s 60th anniversary and the only place you could buy her was at Disneyland. She retailed for $120 and 5000 dolla were made. You can currently find her on an auction website that shall remain nameless for pretty close to the retail price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FQ50KDJIPXDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013U1XU02#wasThisHelpful","R3FQ50KDJIPXDR","ADQGVWIT520HG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQGVWIT520HG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I made it two thirds of the way though this book before stopping. The story just didn't hold my attention . It follows Nora Beasley, a young woman who has arrived at Bellamy Manor to serve as a governess to the Duke's three children. But when King Rupert, cousin of the Duke, is taken with Nora, will the Duke allow the King to take her for ill intent, or will the Duke protect her.This book was a bit strange. It could have been good, but it was just.... boring. The characters were flat and one dimensional. They evoked no emotional response in me as the reader.

"Katie, Josie, and Hannah own three adjoining ranches that their husbands all cared for together. But with the recent deaths of their husbands, the ranches are suffering. Knowing they need men to survive, the send away for mail order husbands.  Katie marries Jason, Josie marries Jim, and Hannah marries Peter. So far so good. This was a decent premise. But from here things fall apart.Josie's husband Jim is violent. Within only hours of arrival, he threatens to shoot anyone that comes on his property, even though in the past all three couples shared the properties. Can the others get Jim to see reason?Other than the premise, there was nothing good about this story. It didn't flow well, and the characters didn't make sense. For instance, in the first scene, Katie is screaming that she will never remarry. But in the never next scene she's getting  hitched, with no explanation as to what changed her mind. And then after only a couple hours, she's head over heels in love with Jason. Seems a bit fast. Then Josie, who's clearly marries a violent brute, defends Jim's actions and is in love with him immediately. Really? After he threatened to kill her friends?Additionally, this book ends on a cliff hanger. There is zero resolution of the plot. If you want to know what happens, you have to pay $9 for all three kindle books. But between the horrible characters, disturbing, jerky plot, and tons of grammatical errors, it's just not worth it. I manages to download all three books for free, but considering how bad this first book was, I won't be reading the last two, even though they were free. Not worth my time.

"Colton spends his time caring for his ailing mother and his injured father, while trying to keep up with the ranch. While the idea of a wife and family appeals to him, he knows his other obligations won't permit him to marry.  But when he finds a newborn baby abandoned at the under construction orphanage, Colton is determined to take the baby home and care for it, as he suspects the baby is family. How he'll find the time to care for the baby, God only knows.Meanwhile, New York City socialite Rebecca Sterling is determined to care for the baby herself. Recently jilted by her ex fianc, Rebecca has traveled west to oversee the construction of a new orphanage in the little town of Evans Grove. Seeing as the newborn was clearly left at the orphanage, that makes himself her responsibility. Unable to come to a consensus, Colton and Rebecca make a compromise. Rebecca, the baby, and young Heidi, another orphan in Rebecca's care, will temporarily move to Colton's ranch to care for the baby together. But once the orphanage is up and running, Rebecca will move back to New York.But as Rebecca spends more time with Colton, she wonders if she wants to go back to New York at all. Will Cotton give her a reason to stay in Evans Grove?Overall I really liked this book. It was a sweet romance. I also liked that the author spent a lot of time developing Heidi's character. A lot of authors would have glossed over a child character. But Heidi brought dimension to an otherwise an typical historical romance.I did, however, struggles a bit with the plot, particularly in the beginning. This is the third book in a series, and I haven't read the previous two books. The author didn't do a very good job of explaining the first two books.

As soon as Anne is settled in Oregon, Emma intends to head back East.

To make matters worse, the fool woman is a doctor,  one who's determined to stick her nose into everything with her unsolicited advice. If he stops the wagon train every time she has a sick patient, they'll never make it to Oregon before winter.Can these two stubborn people work together to care for the train headed to Oregon? And is there are future for them after they get there?This was a very enjoyable book. I really liked Emma and Zachary's characters. However, I was very disappointed in Anne's character. She's stricken with grief after the death of her husband and child, and that's understandable. But I was expecting to see Anne's character develop a bit by the ending, but she didn't. She wa just as depressed at the end. And I honestly thought the premise was illogical and forced. Anne is so depressed she doesn't care if she dies. But then she is insistent she go to Oregon. Someone who doesn't care if they live or die wouldn't give a fig where they live. Just didn't make sense.Overall, this was a goid book that I'd recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5CE444TUFP5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041KLDTM#wasThisHelpful","R5CE444TUFP5H","ADQGVWIT520HG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQGVWIT520HG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Three and a half stars.I got this book as part of the Kindle First program. I enjoyed reading it. It's a nice, relaxing, light romantic comedy. It's the kind of book that I can totally see as a ""chick flick"". It's very reminiscent of ""Sweet Home Alabama"".The female lead, Kendall, is so focused on advancing her career as a serious news reporter that she doesn't give any time to her love life. And when Ty Bishop enters the picture, although she's very attracted to him, she knows he will only distract her from her career goals of joining a morning news show in New York City. Will she give true love a chance?Overall this book was pretty good. It's by no means unique though. It's a typical romantic comedy. Other reviewers commented on how ""deep"" they thought this book was and referenced the childhood emotions Kendall and Ty struggled with in regards to their parents. But to me, ""daddy issues"" are a bit cliche. All that being said however, I still enjoyed this book.There is one sex scene that's moderately descriptive, so just a head's up if that bothers you.Overall, a nice read. Glad I picked it as my Kindle First. For free it was a worthwhile read. But I honestly don't think it's worth the $5.99 the author would normally charge, because as I said, although I enjoyed it, I don't think it was anything super special.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R743F2GEWPKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VARL01U#wasThisHelpful","R743F2GEWPKC","ADQGVWIT520HG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQGVWIT520HG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A very nice cover. I got the white and it looks feminine yet professional. I do have two complaints though. The plastic frame cracked after only about six uses. It still fits my tablet snuggly and it's fine to continue using it. But if it gets a second crack, I think a whole piece of the frame will fall off and then the cover will be useless. Also, when the cover is open with the front and back cover touching, the two covers tend to stick together so tightly, when you pull them apart it sounds like ripping two pieces of Velcro apart.

But are they that desperate that he could even consider hiring a woman to fill that role? Zeb is determined to scare her off and send her back to New York, so he agrees to hire Nora on a trial basis. But nothing seems to faze the young woman. Before he knows it, Zeb is forced to admit to himself that Nora is a top notch physician. But can he admit that to Nora, and can he admit that he's fallen head over heels for the lady doctor?I loved this book. It really brought to the fore the struggles women in the medical field had. To think that some people would rather have no doctor than have a female doctor is so sad, but very realistic of the time.  I really loved both Nora and Zebs characters. They were realistic, relatable, and believable. And as the third book in the series it wraps up all the loose ends from the first two stories.

But despite the tradegy, Emmeline is determined to care for her bedridden mother, her mute sister Bess, her volatile 12 year old brother Johnny, and her 5 year old sister Glory. But at 19, how can she care for her whole family?The answer comes in the form of Will Logan, one of the men who founded the town of High Plains. Will hires Emmeline as a cook for his ranch, and the two begin to spend a great deal of time together. Emmeline is fond of Will, but memories of her physically and emotionally abusive father keep her from ever considering marriage. Can she overcome her fears and give love a chance?This was a very good book. The characters and plot are likeable and believable. Will Logan is a fabulous male lead.

I hate it when books don't give you closure.

My biggest problem was that this is the third book in the series, which was not made clear on the paperback version I purchased at a local used book store, otherwise I would have read the first two books in the series first. Unfortunately, I wouldn't call this a stand alone novel. The action in the book starts in the very first sentence, and many characters are mentioned in the first few pages, characters I obviously had never heard of before. The author assumes you have read the first two books, but since I hadn't, I was lost. For instance, I thought the Dr and his Native American assistant were married based on their interactions, only to find out a third of the way through that they weren't. The author also several times mentions a ""midnight sun"", and I had no idea what that meant. Finally half way through the author mentions the midnight sun in connection with Alaska's days if all sunlight and no darkness\sunset. Then I finally got it. But I wish the aurthor had made it clear from the first reference.Also, the characters and storyline were a bit boring and slow. It felt like it took forever for anything to happen.Overall this was just an OK novel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H0HG008DZEI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XDY00Q#wasThisHelpful","R3H0HG008DZEI2","ADQGVWIT520HG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQGVWIT520HG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This conditioner is a solid for stars. I love that it's all natural and doesn't have the chemical garbage in it that most hair products have. And unlike other all natural hair products, which tend to be thin and runny, this one is very thick and creamy.  I gets all the knots out of my hair and it leaves my hair soft and shiny. I've also noticed that one bottle lasts me a long time, much longer than most other conditioners I've tried.

"This product does NOT work. All I wanted was a simple pedometer that keeps track of how many steps I take each day as a way to monitor my activity and to motivate myself to get up and walk a bit. Based on the other reviews I thought this would do the trick, and I thought the $7.99 price tag was reasonable. Unfortunately this pedometer doesn't work.For starters, when I tried to press the reset button to get it back to zero, I had to press long and hard to reset it. I also noticed the reset button didn't fit quite right and looked like it was about to pop out. Additionally, there are no directions on how to use it or how to change the batteries in English. The only directions provided were in what I assumed was Chinese. But it seemed pretty self explanatory so that wasn't a huge concern.After finally getting it to reset, I decided to try it out while walking up and down my local main street. I put the pedometer in my pocket and off I went. After about an hour of continuous walking, I decided to check it to see how many steps I'd taken. According to the pedometer, I had only taken 90 steps in the past hour. Right. Clearly it wasn't working properly. I gave it a slight shake (heard something inside it rattle) and put it back in my pocket. After another hour, I checked it again and was pleased to see that it now read 6000 steps. It now seemed to be working. Yet another hour later I checked it a third time and was dismayed to see it still said 6000 steps. Ugh.Overall, this product clearly didn't work. It's a peice of junk. What a waste of money. I'll probably return it but I'm not sure if it's worth the return shipping fee and my aggravation.  So I'm still on the hunt for a pedometer that actually works but doesn't cost a fortune and doesn't have all the bells and whistles that I probably won't use (ie the Fitbit). Anyone have any suggestions?","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQC6FC4V24U93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHD80L4#wasThisHelpful","RQC6FC4V24U93","ADQGVWIT520HG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQGVWIT520HG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Memory foam should be firm and supportive, but this provided no support as soon as it was sat upon, and I'm an average size and weight woman.  Very disappointed.

"Two and a half stars.This is the third book in the Lone Star Series. The first book follows Marty, the second follows Alice, and this book follows Jessica. However it also spends a lot of time continuing Marty and Alices' stories. If you've read the first two books and liked them, then you'll be happy that we finally get a resolution to the conflict started in book one surrounding the death of Alice's father and the man that is stalking her. If you haven't read the first two books in this series, then I would strongly recommend reading those before reading this one. Even though I read the first two books fairly recently, I still struggled to remember the back stories and was confused quite a bit of the time. So I can't imagine how hard it would be for someone to read this book without having read the first two.In this book we follow spoiled, self centered Jessica Atherton. Having come to realize just how selfish she is, she decides to become a better person and to focus on others rather than on herself. But when wealthy Harrison Gable makes it clear he wants to marry her, she is tempted. Harrison has the money to allow her to travel the world and to live in comfort. But at the same time Jessica's heart is drawn to Austin Todd. A former Secret Service agent, Jessica knows he has secrets of his own. Will he ever share his heart with her?I have to say I was pretty disappointed with this book, for several reasons.First, as I said, I had a hard time remembering all of the details from the first two books, and Tracie Peterson did a very, VERY poor job of jogging my memory. I wish she had provided a summary or intro at the beginning of the book, recapping the details the reader needed to know from the first two books. At the very least she could have done a much better job of weaving those details into this book. I've read plenty of sequels where the first few pages are devoted to jogging the reader's memory, usually via a dialouge between two characters. It would have been nice if Peterson had done something similar, but apparently she couldn't be bothered. Thus I couldn't remember who was married to who, who was related, and minor plot details of the first two stories.My second issue was that I didn't really like Jessica. I give her credit for recognizing that she's selfish, but she didn't actually do anything about it after her realization. One quick apology and one wedding gift will not make up for years of not caring about others. Jessica should have been more proactive in proving that she was no longer selfish and mean. But instead, all she does is repeatedly ask her mother, ""Do you think I'm selfish?"" and after her mother assures her she's not, she simply goes about her merry way until her next self critical breakdown. So unfortunately I didn't care for the main character. And in general the book was very repetitive.My last issue is that the book is poorly written. The book has a ton of typos and clearly the publisher did not spend enough time editing it. The scenes also changed abruptly, and aren't resolved. In one instance, we read several pages about how Jessica is so excited about going to a concert with Harrison, but we don't get to read anything about their time together at the concert. Peterson doesn't even give us one sentence to let us know if the evening went well or not. The whole scene just felt random and useless. Why build an event up like that and then not even tell us how it went? It doesn't make any sense. In another scence, the scene ends with Jessica aiming a gun at Alice's stalker. It was very exciting, and I was eager to read the next scene to see what the stalker's reaction would be. Would Jessica have to shoot him? Would Austin come to her rescue? But in the very next scene, without any preamble about how Jessica got out of that sticky situation, we see Harrison proposing to Jessica. Wait, what??? Where did Harrison come from? What happened to the stalker? Did Jessica shoot him? I went back and re-read the last several pages because I was sure I had missed something, but I hadn't. It was just sloppy writing on Tracie Peterson's part, and equally poor editing.Overall, this book was very sloppy. It didn't feel cohesive. It felt very much like a first draft. I recently read another one of Tracie Peterson's books, A Steadfast Heart, and had almost identical feelings. I feel like Peterson's more recent books are of very poor quality, as if she isn't spending enough time on them. I'm not sure why that is. I would hope she would want to write a book that she could be proud of, that she could say she gave 100 percent to. But I just don't see how she could have given this book her all. She definitely didn't, and her publisher didn't either.My recommendation would be to not bother reading this book. But if you love Tracie Peterson or want to finish the series, then I would suggest getting it from a library. I just don't think this is a book worth paying for.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9AH2OWYYTQNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764210602#wasThisHelpful","R9AH2OWYYTQNC","ADQGVWIT520HG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQGVWIT520HG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There was nothing wrong with it per se, but the story is very quick and I found that to be disappointing. The characters developed in the blink of an eye and before I knew it the book was over and all the conflict had been resolved.  If the story had been fleshed out a bit, perharps to double the length so as to be a novella, I think I would have liked it much better and given it four or maybe even five stars. The author writes well, and I think she's more than capable of making the story longer.In it's current state this book felt too rushed. It was ok to read for free, but I don't think it's a book I'd pay for, even for only 99 cents.

"The Traitor's Wife is the storty of Benedict Arnold's betrayal of the Colonial Army to the British, and the impact his wife, Peggy, had on said betrayal.There are 2 main characters in this book: Peggy Shippen Arnold, eventual wife of Benedict Arnold, and Clara Bell, personal maid to Peggy. There are also two very big problems in this book, them being..... Peggy and Clara.I had a lot of issues with the two main characters. For starters, the author portrays Peggy as nothing more than a spoiled,  immature, selfish, manipulative, conniving witch. While she did come across as smart enough to commit treason, she didn't come across as dedicated enough and educated enough in politics to actual commit the act. Someone determined to commit treason would have to know the smallest details about the war, it's leaders, etc. But never once does the author mention Peggy reading a newspaper to find out the latest on the war, or discussing politics with people at social events, etc. And when she finally does start communicating with the British, she's not smart enough to realize that John Andre was returning her communication with as coded response. She had the stupidity to think that he would write about treason in plain terms. So overall, at least based on the way Pataki describes Peggy and her actions, there's no way Peggy could have been so influential in regards to Arnold's treason. I would assume that in real life she was more educated regarding the details of the war. Also, I didn't like that the author portrayed Peggy has having absolutely zero redeeming qualities. The best villians are the ones that you feel just a tiny bit of sympathy for, but Pataki's version of Peggy evoked no sympathy from me. Apparently in real life, Peggy was a very devoted mother, a trait that would have made Peggy's character more well rounded, but Pataki portrays Peggy as a callous, uncaring mother. And Peggy's character never changed or developed throughout the novel.I was also very disappointed in Clara's character. While Clara was kind and sweet, I found her to be too kind and naive. It isn't until the very last pages of the book that she finally develops a backbone, but for me it was too little too late. And unfortunately there is little to no character development of Clara either. But my biggest problem with Clara is that she never existed. Yes, Peggy had a personal maid, but there is zero proof that her maid had any knowledge of the Arnold's treasonous plot, nor did a maid provide such knowledge to the Continental Army. The idea the Peggy and Benedict would discuss their treasonous plots in front of Clara, and take her with them on their rendezvous with the British, is ludicrous and totally implausible. There is no way the Arnolds would have willingly allowed Clara to be privy to their plot.I also don't understand why Pataki would stray so far from historical truth and omit so many details. For instance, the novel makes it out that Clara's knowledge of the plot and her informing Caleb Little, and in turn, the Continental Army, of the plot was what lead to the discovery of Arnold's betrayal. But at the end of the book, in the section entitled, ""A Note on History and Sources"", Pataki herself admits, and I quote, ""Since Caleb Little is a fictional character, so too is the role he played in the apprehension of John Andre following his meeting with Benedict Arnold. The true credit goes to militiamen John Paulding, David Williams, and Isaac Van Wart. I apologize for omitting them and not giving them their proper due for the role they played in saving the American Revolution."" End quote. This is just one example of historical facts that Pataki decided to omit, or in this case completely change, in what I would assume is her attempt at making her novel more entertaining. Well, I found the inaccuracies frustrating and to be frank I didn't find the book entertaining in the least. I couldn't get passed the blatant lies that Pataki was telling.If you don't care about historical accuracy and giving credit where credit is due, then you might enjoy this book. But even then, considering how poorly the characters Peggy and Clara were portrayed and developed, I would think it would still be hard to like this book.Overall, not a book I would recommend.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SNWT8YHUSPGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476738602#wasThisHelpful","R2SNWT8YHUSPGJ","ADQGVWIT520HG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQGVWIT520HG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Four and a half stars""Twice Loved"" is the ""sweet/clean"" version of ""Shades of Honor"", so if you have already read ""Shades of Honor, Grayson Brothers, Book 1"", then you have already read this story. Personally I thought this story was very good as it was, and didn't feel that there was any need for any sex scenes. In fact I think sex scenes would have greatly detracted from the book and my opinion of its characters.The summary: Evelyn is engaged to Kyle Grayson, her childhood best friend. While she doesn't feel romantic lovr for him, she knows he will provide for her and her aging father. But when Radford Grayson, Kyle's older brother, returns to town, things go haywire. Grayson has avoided his family ever since he returned from the Civil War. Tortured by things he saw and did in battle, he struggles to form relationships. And he has difficulty figuring out how to care for his young daughter Rebecca.But Evelyn somehow manages to get through to both of them. She quickly takes on a mother role for Rebecca. And before she knows it she is forming a strong bond with Radford, a bond she has never been able to form with Kyle. Should she stick to her engagement and marry Kyle, or should she give herself the chance to fall truly in love?This was a very good book. The characters were well developed and the plot believable. I liked the Civil War details that were included. Radford clearly had post traumatic stress disorder following the war, but at the time this was not recognized and not understood. But I love how Evelyn didn't judge Radford, but was warm and caring and eager to help him.Little to no typos also made this a great read.Overall, I really liked this book. I recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LUPFVIRF7I1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UI5G3CQ#wasThisHelpful","R2LUPFVIRF7I1G","ADQGVWIT520HG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQGVWIT520HG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Twenty year old Mildred has her life turned upside down after a fire destroys her family's home. With her mother dead and her father severely injured, she is now responsible for the well being of her thirteen year old brother Joseph and her fifteen year old sister Ruth. To make matters worse, she suspects that someone deliberately set fire to the house. But who would try to kill them, and why? Mildred is grateful to have the protection of deputy Mitchell Moore, and before she knows it, she's falling in love with him. But how can she marry when her family so desperately needs her help?I have to say I was very disappointed by this book. It had a decent premise and some potential, but after the first few paragraphs all of that came to a skidding halt. I was able to finish the book, but I only did so in order to provide the most thorough review possible.My first issue with this book is that a lot of it didn't make any logical sense. In the beginning of the book, the author describes the devasting fire that destroys their home. The three children make an attempt to save the house and to save their parents from the burning building. They even go so far as to hitch a wagon and pull the wagon up to the window of their parents bedroom so that they can lower their parents down safely. The reality is that a house made out of pure wood, which is how the author describes it, would go up in flames and collapse in mere minutes. There would have been no time to hitch a wagon and no time for the siblings to argue about how to save their parents. They would have been lucky to escape with their own lives. Thus the fire scene that the author describes was completely unbelievable. The house would have burned to the ground way before the scene was finished. The other thing that didn't make sense was that according to the author, Mildred hadn't been to town in over a year. She says the reason for this is that even in a wagon it takes an entire day to travel to town and back. But if that's the case, why does the author talk about Ruth having friends in school? If town is that far away, she wouldn't have gone to school. She would have been educated by her mother at home.I also didn't like any of the children's characters. Joseph was only 13, but he acted way, way more mature than a 13 year old boy would act. Meanwhile, at age 20, Mildred was too immature. She let her brother, seven years her junior and still just a child, dictate her actions and make serious decisions for the family. And Ruth was a total brat and extremely selfish.Additionally I had issues with the way the author describes emotions, particularly after the fire and the death of their mother. The author's attempts at putting these emotions to paper was juvenile at best. The emotions described came across as forced and unrealistic. It was hard to take the characters' feelings seriously when the writing was so poor.My biggest issue with this book was the writing in and of itself. The author doesn't have a clue in terms of the proper use of a comma. She has commas randomly inserted into her sentences in places where a comma doesn't belong. As I mentioned, the writing style is very juvenille and the sentence structure is so simple that there are so few sentences in this book that actually require a comma. But there are thousands of commas in this book, all improperly used, and it drove me crazy! I had to try and remember that if I saw a comma to just keep reading straight through and not pause briefly like you're normally supposed to. The writing was so bad that I wonder if English is the author's second language. Either way, this book needs a very, VERY thorough editing.The reality is that the issues I mentioned are easily fixed, and that the story itself could probably be considered four stars if those issues were fixed. I hope the author takes my thoughts into account and uses them to improve and update her book. If she made changes it would be a book I would recommend. But as it currently is, I cannot recommend this book. It wasn't worth it to read it for free,  and it's certainly not worth the $2.99-$4.50 I've seen the author charging for it.Overall, not a book I would recommend in its current state.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZ4A3GWBW8N1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGXVG8K#wasThisHelpful","RGZ4A3GWBW8N1","ADQGVWIT520HG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQGVWIT520HG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Typical AAA alkaline battery that is being billed as eco friendly because it has up to a 3.8% recycled content.  Somehow, 3.8% doesn't seem like much to me but I guess it gives us 3.8 batteries per 100 made without using any more resources and every bit helps.Batteries fit properly, had the stated voltage as measured with a DVM and passed my acid test with flying colors (two in an old fashioned style flashlight but a regular bulb, not LED).  The held up for almost exactly the same amount of time as a Duracell Ultra.  Shelf life is extended for up to 12 years according to the packaging but really, do people keep batteries unused for 12 years.  I'd put a couple away to test again in 12 years but chances of remembering them are slim to none.Why not 5 stars you ask?

"I bought the Stick because it's the only android based device that has the ability to run Kodi TV even though there isn't an official app for it on the Stick (but it is in the Amazon app store for other android devices?).  With a little bit of searching, it's easy to find out how to install Kodi which provides a huge range of content.We have exceptional wifi - 105mbs so buffering or delays are never a problem with this device.  Amazon Prime video is intuitive and you can actually view your watchlist on this device unlike the Amazon app on our Vizio TV.I hope that as the TV industry moves towards al la carte TV, Amazon will keep pace with the available streaming options.  I think we are only a year or two away from being able to buy only those 10-15 cable channels you actually watch for a very reasonable price and then streaming them via a device like this.  No more paying for 200 channels you never watch because of devices like this.I'm curious at this point if the voice activated remote works well on the regular Fire TV.  While the one that comes with this is simple to use, it does take some time if you have to fill in a search box using the old point and click on screen keyboard.  In fairness, you can avoid all that with the TV app on your Kindle or smartphone and it works quite well but a voice controlled remote that actually understood speech would be so convenient.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O49GUNNXJ0HJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDQ0RMG#wasThisHelpful","R1O49GUNNXJ0HJ","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already own the ""standard"" version of the Bissell PowerFresh steam mop and have found it to be superior to the others I've tried over the years.  So, when I got a chance to try out the ""Pet"" version, I jumped on the chance.  Not quite sure what makes it a pet version but it certainly is the deluxe version compared to the standard edition.First and foremost, in floor cleaning mode, it works as well as the original, maybe even a little better because I think it might make a bit more steam but that could be because my old one is going on three years old and may be losing some oomph.  It is more difficult to fill with water because of the removable steam chamber - not sure that could have been done differently so it is what it is.It comes with a LOT of attachments, some of which seem to be just different colors of the same option (green, blue and black brushes, all exactly the same).  It comes with a nice drawstring bag to keep all those attachments, and the extension hose, in.  The steam chamber releases with one button and a good tug and then the attachment hose plugs in.  I really like the small ""carpet"" cleaning pad setup only I used it on kitchen counter tops and it works fantastic.  The little brushes are great for getting into tight spaces, especially in the kitchen.  Do let the whole thing cool down before making changes - steam is hot and it makes the cloth pads hot.The only negative (and it's not really a negative) is that removing the adapter from the steam chamber takes a little bit of muscle but it has to because it must have a very tight seal to not leak steam.  I do wonder how durable the attachment hose is going to be - seems a bit flimsy but that just may be that it's actually very flexible for ease of use.So, if you have a lot of tile/wood/vinyl flooring, kitchen and bathroom counter tops and like to clean without harsh chemicals, this is the device for you.  Again, not sure what makes it pet specific - perhaps you're supposed to train your dog/cat to operate it for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NOYWQFI96A53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LS47SA#wasThisHelpful","R3NOYWQFI96A53","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the interest of full disclosure, this was a free product, provided for evaluation purposes.  Even at free, it's not a shaver I would own for a number of reasons.  The most important reason, and the whole idea behind an electric shaver, is the low quality of the shave provided.  It takes a lot of strokes and angles to get even a decent cut.  But, this has been typical of foil shavers for a long time and the main reason I'm a rotary shaver fan.It is also not ergonomically designed - the handle has an odd shape to it, not one that easily fits your hand.  It wouldn't matter if it was a one stroke shaver but given that it's not, changing angles and directions is more uncomfortable than it needs to be.  It's also fairly heavy given its performance, again, not a comfort feature.The pop up trimmer works well as they all seem to these days.  The shaver is low end, not having any information available to the user other than the charge light.

"If you cannot get wi-fi throughout your house, this is a fantastic product.  It uses the electrical wiring to act as an Ethernet connection and as long as you plugged directly into the wall outlet and not a power strip it works fine.  But, here's the problem I encountered - it cut my speed by at least 25% over my wireless connection - exactly the opposite of what you would expect.My wi-fi is a 5G, I get a 85-90% signal strength to my router and I have 105mbs service.  At my wireless desktop, I consistently get the 105down/12up.  Using the Powerline setup, that speed drops to around 70/10 and I suspect it's because the signal over your electrical wiring isn't clean and error checking is slowing down the process.  Now the good news - at the furthest point in the house, the wi-fi signal drops off to 40-50% strength and speeds get down into the 50/10 range.  With this Powerline, I can plug directly into it and get back to at least 70/10 and I may try running a wireless range extender through it to see if it maintains those speeds.So, for the money, you can basically extend your wired network as far as you wish and then convert it back to wireless or just hook directly to the Powerline.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RRQ45IOJFQUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Q29KRK#wasThisHelpful","R1RRQ45IOJFQUF","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not very many of the characters from previous books appear, the new ones which are introduced are a lot more shallow and in one case, an odd choice to render aid and comfort to.The story line itself is a bit disjointed and out of context with who Jesse is supposed to be.

"Like so many environmentally friendly products, this one disappoints.  I understand the need to protect the environment, only use ""safe"" chemicals around the house and allow for the complete lack of responsibility of many parents.  But, there comes a time when you need a product that actually cleans using harsh and dangerous chemicals, but, unfortunately, most of them have been moved over to the commercial market and are no longer available to the average consumer.  We are left with these citrus based products that try hard to be what we want but in the end, are nothing more than very, very light duty cleaners.This product does not attack grease even though it is heavily touted as doing so. It simply smears it around, making the situation worse than when you started.  It does seem to work acceptably on clear vinyl but since you have to thoroughly rinse clear vinyl before rubbing anything across it, likely 90% of the cleaning is done by the initial rinsing and not by this product.  If you just spray this on dry vinyl, you'll end up with some interesting swirl patterns from rubbing the grit all around the surface.Rather unfortunate because I am a 303 protectant devotee - easily the best vinyl treatment on the market.

"Perhaps the most technically incorrect/deficient novel I've ever read.  The whole premise of the novel is built upon false information and just ruins the storyline.One does not simply steal a drone and start flying it.  Even if you had the correct console (which is never mentioned as part of the theft), you must have the proper encryption for a particular drone.  The encryption is changed on a regular basis and must be changed at both ends - programming is sent to the drone itself from one source and to the control station from another.  The drone and the station must then handshake to authenticate.  These encryption schemes can be changed independently of each other making both unworkable.There is also an over command function in every drone we are currently flying.  That function allows a pair of senior officers to authorize the release of the drone from its primary control and handing it over to command and control with all weapons systems disabled.  It can only be RTB flown at that point.The final safeguard is a self-destruct feature that is operated via a totally different communications channel using a different encryption method.  While it is there primarily to insure that if there is a mechanical failure in a deployed unit, it can be destroyed so that technical data cannot be salvaged when the drone goes down, it can actually be activated for other reasons, given the correct set of commands.All of these things (and probably more that are even more closely guarded) would have prevented the scenario presented in this novel.But assume for a moment that they would find a way to overcome all these safeguards.  Now you have to suspend reality and believe that a separate device released from the drone, called remoras in the book, can track down a jet capable of super-sonic speeds and incredible acceleration under full military power.  And yet these remoras, released at a MAXIMUM speed of 135 but with no capability to increase its acceleration can track down a sophisticated military fighter jet is just ridiculous.  And forget completely the aerobatics the drone itself is capable of - the writer has obviously never flown aerobatic certified aircraft as he would realize that the gyrations being described are not possible given the known configuration of existing fixed wing aircraft.I can suspend reality with the best of them when it adds to a story but when it becomes the whole basis of the story then it makes the work unreadable.

"Ellsworth has a natural writing ability and good thing because he needed every bit of it to make this novel work, barely.  It is a convoluted mess that he manages to hold together with bailing wire and duct tape and, in the end, produces a decent story.  It's the furthest reach into fiction that the author has made yet, tip toeing at the edge of incredulity.  Seriously, waterboarded 150 times!  Navy Seals break after 3 or 4 sessions but not our little heroine.Then there is the annoying writer about whom the story is loosely (very loosely) constructed.  The ""excerpts"" from her book are distracting at best and annoying at worse.  And ultimately the story has almost nothing to do with her so the book is hardly aptly titled.The book was headed towards a solid three star effort and the last 30-40 pages pulled it up by the bootstraps to make it a weak four star.  Just too far off the beaten path for this reader, let's get back to high courtroom drama and intelligently crafted characters that are likable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30TN3OXO38A4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZDHI72#wasThisHelpful","R30TN3OXO38A4U","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is our second stone, first one lasted two years of weekly pizza baking at 500F.  Very well made, finish is very nice and slick enough that it doesn't require grease.  However, the finish will wear over time, requiring greasing the stone for ease of pizza removal.  The finish still seals the stone properly.We like this because of the size, the helpful side handles and the durability.

This is industrial grade velcro - both sides are plastic, they press together for a TIGHT fit and once together, are going to stay together.  Then there is the adhesive!

Characters came and went but always with a good understanding of why the entered the narrative.Fast forward to present day and I think White writes only for his publisher.

"Lots of positive reviews here and I think in a home or small office environment, it's probably a good choice.  However, if you are running any kind of extensive wide area network, you may wish to think twice.I run a computer lab for our technology club.  9 ethernet wired computers, 4 ethernet wired printers with reserved addresses, 1 wireless printer and 1 wireless laptop plus 5-20 wireless users at any given time.  TP-Link themselves said it could handle the traffic.  We run a Comcast 100mps business account with five static IP addresses and never lose Internet on any of the other devices.This router drops out about once every five days.  Drops the Internet and the WAN and doesn't recover until it's unplugged and repowered up.  Even then, it takes as long as 20 minutes to reconnect the entire network.  Our old Netgear router that was six years old NEVER dropped the connection - not once in six years.  Unfortunately, it died and this was our first choice.TP-Link support is a person with a heavy accent reading from a script.  I begged and pleaded to be connected to a real engineer who understands WAN's and static IP's.  Finally submitted a written ticket and now waiting for some type of reply.  I freely admit I may have something set incorrectly - I'm not a computer engineer, far from it.  I pretty much followed the same setup for this as our Netgear had - same security, DHCP  settings, static IP settings, reserved IP addresses and what not.If we can get it running right before the return deadline, I will update this review, otherwise it's going back and we're going back to Netgear.  Shame because when it's working, throughput and range are excellent.Update 02/28/15 - I'm starting to wonder why anyone would deal with TP-Link.  Their latest ""solution"" is to limit concurrent users to 5-10 - LOL.  My off brand home router that is eight years old handles 12 clients with a lot of video downloads and never misses a beat.  To think in this day and age that an AC router could only handle a maximum of 10 clients is just ludicrous.  If I don't hear directly from an actual tech/engineer today, it will be in the mail back to Amazon Monday.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM4D7ET7LW2V2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDLRHFW#wasThisHelpful","RM4D7ET7LW2V2","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought this set because it was inexpensive and we were off to Maui for ten days and snorkeling was high on our list of to-do's.  I was somewhat skeptical about the short fins but they turned out to be great for our purposes.  If you're into free diving, they fins would be horrible but for paddling around on the surface, they were very comfortable.  The mask seals well and the dry tube snorkel actually works.  The set is compact enough to get into your luggage and that was a big plus for me.The only downside, and thus a four star rating, is the snorkel tube is round and the attachment clip for the mask slides up to the top too easily.  There is a nub on the tube to prevent this but when the mouthpiece is not in your mouth, it invariably rides up the tube and then you have to align the nub to get it back down to the proper position.

"Too bad there isn't an option for more than five stars, this book is that good.  Probably one of the best 100 books I've ever read and that's saying a lot.  I first read Sea of Crisis by this author because it was free for a day or two on Amazon and that book was exceptional in its own right - this one might even be better.There are very few authors who can jump from one genre to the next and maintain the quality of writing but Steere has proven he has that ability in spades.  I generally dislike love stories and historical novels and yet this book is both but so much more.  It's a coming of age novel, a war story, a love story and a thriller, all rolled neatly and nicely into one book.Do yourself a huge favor and buy this book.  Then do yourself another favor and write a review so that perhaps we can encourage this incredible author to continue plying his trade.

"Baldacci started his writing in the late 90's with really good books like Absolute Power and Total Control - these were standalone novels that ranked with the best thrillers being written.  After a series of these standalone novels, he started entering into formula writing with the King & Maxwell series, then branching into the Camel Club.  With each of these iterations, he has gotten further and further from that which made him an outstanding writer and now with this Puller series, he has truly fallen into a cesspool of mediocrity.I tried reading this book twice.  First time, I got about 25% into it and just didn't see the point.  While the premise was interesting, the execution was simply boring.  Put it away and went on to read a couple of really good independent authors but I kept coming back to the reviews on Amazon and with 2400 people LOVING this book, felt like I had really missed something or was just in the wrong mood for the book so I picked i up again.This time I got to 55% of the book and could simply take no more.  It was dull, uninspired, moving lethargically towards a conclusion that I frankly, was not all that interested in.  This time the book went down for good and it the last Baldacci book I will buy - that's why we have libraries.Obviously I'm in a very, very small minority in my review of the book.  Equally obvious is that all those 4 and 5 star reviews are seeing something I completely missed.  But I still felt compelled to write this, only in the hopes that someday we may get another Absolute Power out of Baldacci instead of canned and processed writing.  I really wish I could have been in the majority that loved this book but sadly, after two attempts, I'm just going to have to be in the ""didn't like it category"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R76CF2LVVWD9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRISI42#wasThisHelpful","R76CF2LVVWD9Y","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The stories are always well thought out, not particularly challenging to read and make for a nice way to pass a rainy weekend.  Try her books, you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HB7H3LGEULVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002AMVYUQ#wasThisHelpful","R3HB7H3LGEULVQ","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Almost perfect!  It hold my Keurig on top, the drawer opens and closes easily and it holds a nice supply of k-cups.  The one deficiency is that there needs to be dividers running perpendicular to the existing ones.  This would create a neat little compartment for each cup.  As it is, once you've used a couple of cups out of a row, they start falling over.  Now, you can turn them upside down for more stability but then you can't really see what is in the pod.  I have not seen one with individual compartments and so I'm happy with this one until I do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW58IWGPPWNC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007R900WA#wasThisHelpful","RW58IWGPPWNC2","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned, but will never own again, so called ""bagless"" vacuum cleaners and hated every one of them.  You can spend more on all the special HEPA and micro filters than you would on bags for your bagged cleaner.  Bags really only have to do a few things:  Not burst, not let dust escape, not decrease dramatically in efficiency as they fill and, as a nice optional feature - somewhat clean the air.Well, these bags do all of the above and quite nicely.  Regular bags, after a couple weeks in the machine, seem to develop a stale odor.  These are treated so as to prevent that smell from developing.  They capture dust very well - no exhaust at all.  They also seem as if they will last longer than the ""plain"" paper bags we've been using.If I have any complaint it's that they are a little harder to install.  The paper is thicker than normal and pushing it onto the exhaust pipe inside the bag is just a touch more difficult but hardly worth downgrading the bag for.  All in all, I will continue to use these as the house does seem to smell better after a good vacuum (especially important in that we own a dog that sheds in copious quantities).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BSVE5KPIZWJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4SPOOO#wasThisHelpful","R2BSVE5KPIZWJT","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, the Shakespearean ripoff finally comes to an end but what a bloody violent end it is.  While the entire series has been masterful, Sutter leaned way too hard on the violence angle in act VII.  Was there some minimum body count required per episode?  How about a shocking level of gore?  Maybe lots and lots of gratuitous sex scenes?  Whatever the requirement was, it was certainly met!If I sound harsh, it's only because seasons 1-6 were truly good drama while season 7 seemed to be out to shock the viewer more than entertain.  And, it ends pretty much the same way Shakespeare ended the play(s) of a similar theme.  Still one of the best series to ever appear on TV and well worth the viewers time as long as they are not easily offended by violence, sex and gore.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7NRHKKZNZ5AZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4D5F5K#wasThisHelpful","R7NRHKKZNZ5AZ","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an absolutely incredible wax for show car purposes,mediocre at best for that daily driver.  The problem is in the durability - there is little to none in the blazing Arizona sun.  However, the dept of shine is unmatched by any products I've used.  It gives an almost wet look to the car with an incredible depth to the paint.  You will need to claybar your paint first if you want best finish as there appears to be zero cleaners in this wax - it is truly a wax.I did one half of my single stage paint car (no clear coat) with this and the other  half with my standby, Turtle Carnuba/Cleaner wax.  The butter wax side was noticeably deeper and shinier and you could tell it had ""fed"" the paint because that side had more color depth and luster.  Unfortunately, one week of daily driving and the butter wax side was fading noticeably.  I can usually get three months out of the Turtle here in the desert southwest.So if you're trying to win that car show, impress friends then it's an excellent wax for that.  Not particularly difficult to apply or remove so waxing won't be an all day job.  Just don't look for it to provide much in the way of long term protection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EJKAUFXCZPN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FALVU8A#wasThisHelpful","R1EJKAUFXCZPN4","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All of Ellsworth's books are enjoyably readable and while not particularly heavy in subject matter, hold the readers interest quite well.  His courtroom/legal descriptions are excellent and geared towards the layman, not other attorneys.  I would suggest to new readers that they start with book one and work their way through as the books chronicle the life and times of the protagonist - Thaddeus Murfee.  Knowing how he go to where he is in any given book just makes them that much more enjoyable.

"Our association uses these for webcasting our board meetings and we suggest any residents who wish to participate virtually use them as they eliminate the echo effect.  We also use them on all the computers in our lab since we don't want speakers bothering other users.  Clarity is excellent and the voice function works very well.

"I hate to bad mouth a product that I received for free but then the whole idea of the Vine program is to generate honest reviews so here goes.I've been a Norelco user for 50+ years, through the good (made in USA) to the bad (made in China) and the in-between (now made in China but in a plant owned and managed by corporate).  My current model gives a very close shave and I have a heavy beard.  That gives me some basis of comparison.I was sent the gone hunting model which is kind of silly in itself.  I guess if you're really into camo and hunting, it has some appeal but it's just window dressing to the real issue and that is how closely and comfortably it shaves.  Sadly to say, it fell short in the closeness area compared to its more well known competitor.  It was comfortable enough but I suspect that's because it wasn't providing a close shave, just kind of gliding across my beard rather than cutting it.It was so bad the first time, I kept checking to see if there was some plastic protectors on the shaving heads that I had not removed but no, it was just not providing a good grooming experience.  Then I tried it wet and while it seemed to perform somewhat better, if I'm going to go to all that trouble, I might as well take up a blade.  I like electric shavers because they are quick and I can move around somewhat while shaving.  I've never gotten into the whole lather up my face and take a nice bladed razor to it - to me shaving is more of a chore than an ""experience"".If I was going to spend this kind of money on an electric, I'd just get the top of the line competitor and get the closest possible electric shave.  If I want to show off to my hunting buddies by having the only camo shaver in camp, this is it - of course, real hunters don't shave during hunting season.I see by all the rave reviews that I'm in a very small minority so perhaps the reader should take that into account when making a buying decision.  Fortunately, Amazon is so good about customer service that if you buy it through them and are unhappy, it's very easy to return.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D5EVI6XTNDQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBZQ6YU#wasThisHelpful","R1D5EVI6XTNDQG","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice edition to the Pines series and is a nice reflection on the way the Pines author, Blake Crouch, has allowed others to build on his trilogy - truly a unique idea in writing.My only caution is that you DO NOT read this book before reading the Pines series (or at least the first book in the series).

"I'm not sure what marketing strategy Amazon is following as they seem to take away content with each successive generation.  This gen is lacking the mini-hdmi port out that was on the 1st generation Fire.  Probably not a big deal to many folks but I often give presentations from it using an HDMI cable to a big screen TV.  It also really bugs me that I've got to inevitably buy a new cover for each generation but I guess that's a great way to keep selling covers.At the current price of 109 (black Friday weekend), it certainly is an inexpensive tablet that is quite capable.  At some point, I do wish Amazon would make the battery serviceable since it will last about two years with daily use and then not hold a charge.  That's why this one was purchased and I'm sure in another two years, I'll need another just because of the battery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R45X0C9PLN2IQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCHS1FG#wasThisHelpful","R45X0C9PLN2IQ","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr. Meighan,It should be apparent from all the negative reviews here that the ""downgrades"" to the Deluxe version have greatly alienated a lot of very loyal customers.  The mere fact that you've had to write an open letter and respond to so many reviews should tell you something.When I started using TT in the late 90's, there weren't a lot of other choices but I was happy with your product and remained a customer since that time.  I'm also a dedicated Quicken users and like the fact the two programs can ""talk"" to one another.  FWIW, I also taught college in Fredericksburg, Va. and had dozens of your employees come through my classes and hopefully provided them with some additional business management skills to benefit Intuit.  All this is background to let you know they don't come any more committed then me, even though I'm usually angry when I'm forced to upgrade my Quicken periodically but I always bite the bullet and do so.Now I'm ready to start the initial work on my 2014 taxes, come to Amazon to download TT and as always, research what others have experienced.  Now I'm hearing things like ""reduced functionality"" or ""hey, you can still mail it in with those schedules"".  Well, who mails their tax returns when they are using software to prepare them?  Plus, I wish to file online to take advantage of the Amazon 10% gift card bonus, something I don't believe I can do if filing my mail.Just my own opinion, but when almost half the early adopters of the 2014 software are slamming it for these changes, it is perhaps time to look inward and consider that perhaps Intuit has made a huge error and take steps to correct it.  Perhaps you need, as a corporation, to bit the bullet and pull Deluxe from the market and offer the Premier edition for the remainder of the tax season at the same price as Deluxe.  Will it hurt profits?  Sure.  Will it build customer goodwill - you betcha!  Will it insure returning customers keep returning and keep referring others - Absolutely!If you continue down this road of answering negative reviews with what is basically a ""you can make it work - sort of"", you are going to maximize short term profits at the expense of long term customer retention.  If I taught your employees anything, I hope it was that a customer is the most valuable commodity a company has and don't ever, ever loose them over foolish, and preventable, reasons.  It costs WAY more to get them back then it does to keep them.Thank you.Update 03/18/15:  Fairness works in both directions and so I must acknowledge that Intuit finally recognized the error of their ways and corrected the problem.  Better late than never certainly applies here and it looks like they've already committed to next years product returning to the old one we all knew and loved.No doubt from the reviews here that Intuit did a great deal of corporate PR damage.  Much of it is, unfortunately, permanent and those customers will never return, especially since they have since purchased a competitive product, been happy with it and will now be able to easily export this years data into next years return.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JSXLQEN5X2YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NG7JVSQ#wasThisHelpful","R1JSXLQEN5X2YN","A1J1S9E53DNAP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J1S9E53DNAP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WTH, this is supposed to be a newer generation then my first one and yet it lacks cameras!  It only ordered it because it was recommended by the customer service agent as a replacement for my 2nd gen Fire that had the battery fail after two years.  It went back in the mail as a return the same day it was received.Amazon needs to address their battery technology.  I get about two years out of my Kindle batteries and now it looks like the same expectation for the Fire products.  Two years is not good but hey, at least make the darn things serviceable so that a user can EASILY and INEXPENSIVELY replace the battery every two years.

"I'll always give almost any book a chance to enthrall me and in this case, I hung in for 25% of the book and then flat gave up.  There is no excitement, no drama, no real courtroom action, basically a whole lot of character development that was leading nowhere.  Reads very much like a book that was due to the publisher by a certain deadline and was cobbled together for that reason alone.
