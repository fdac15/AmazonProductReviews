" 1:32 MinsFrankincense is a must have oil for me during the holiday season. I have grown the tree and used Frankincense tears as well as many brands of the essential oil. I have to say I am very pleased with the scent of the Frankincense Essential Oil from Natural Acres. It is a true Frankincense scent. The essential oil does not contain fillers, additives, base or carrier oils - and I know this from personal experience using oils that do and do not have these products added plus my own distillation experience.In addition to using this essential oil to scent potpourri or holiday decorations, it is good for clearing the mind as other therapeutic uses. This is not intended as medical advice it is simply my observation.The bottle comes with an attached plastic top with a dropper in it but it is easy to remove if you are like me and prefer a glass eye dropper (not included).High quality product that I highly recommend!Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

" 1:02 MinsI was pleasantly surprised when I opened this bottle of Grapefruit Essential Oil From Natural Acres. I don't like grapefruit but I have smelled plenty when people ate it around me and I did like the scent - citrusy and crisp - refreshing. That is exactly what this essential oil smelled like! I could tell it was citrusy yet the grapefruit smell came through as it should.The citrus smell is very stimulating and great for mental alertness - while I am not a doctor this is a personal observation from years of using different types of citrus essential oils. I felt more alert when I smelled this Grapefruit Essential Oil - and to me this is as expected.This is a 100% pure essential oil free of bases, carriers, additives and fillers. I know this because I tested it and I have distilled my own oils - so I know a quality oil when I see and smell it.I have been very impressed with the Natural Acres Brand Essential Oils and I do recommend them.Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

" 1:47 MinsCedarwood Essential Oil has long been a staple in my essential oil kit. My most used purpose is in potpourri - however that is not the only possible use. While I am not a licensed doctor - and this is not intended as medical advice - there are a number of therapeutic uses of Cedarwood Essential Oil such as helping the skin recover from blemishes or rashes.I really liked the scent of this essential oil because it was not overpowering like some brands. The cedar scent came through - warm and woodsy. This is a 100% pure essential oil that is not diluted with a base or a carrier and there are no fillers or additives. How do I know that? I have distilled many essential oils in my time - and used many brands.This is a high quality product and I recommend it.Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

" 2:19 MinsI have been using essential oils for many years, but Helichrysum Essential Oil is new to me even though I am very familiar with the plant. I was pleasantly surprised at the pleasing vibrant floral scent and suspect this is going to be one of my favorite essential oils from here on out.As someone who has distilled their own essential oils, I feel confident saying this is 100% pure essential oil - no fillers, additives, base or carrier oils.The 10ml bottle comes with a plastic top with a dropper on it. You can use it as it is or remove the top and use a glass eye dropper (not included).It does easily diffuse with water or mix into carrier oils.I like this oil and if you have not tried it, I recommend that you do - both for the therapeutic properties and the scent!

" 3:22 MinsNatural Acres 100% pure Eucalyptus Essential Oil is just what it claims to be - no fillers, additives, base or carrier oils. This is important to me because I can dilute and mix the essential oil how I want to. I can add it to aromatherapy diffusers, carrier oils for massage and so much more.Eucalyptus Essential Oil is a must have in my household. I deal with allergies and lots of congestion and this is what I use this oil for - now this is not intended as medical advice. This is simply a statement of how I use this oil.The scent is not overbearing but rather mellow and I appreciate this. I could tell it worked when I opened the bottle and caught a whiff of the scent. I am very congested right now but I could smell this eucalyptus oil.I really like this essential oil and do recommend it. For those who are just getting into aromatherapy this is a must-have on hand oil as far as I am concerned.Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

" 2:33 MinsI am quite familiar with Jojoba Oil as I have used it for years - and grown the plant from seed. I love that the Pure Body Naturals is organic. It is a high quality jojoba oil that I am happy to use in my bath and body products as well as my massage oils. This oil is great for your hair, skin and nails - best of all you can scent it with an essential oil of your choosing.I like that this oil is cold pressed and unrefined. In my opinion that is the best you can buy.It dilutes well with water so you can use it on your face without using it straight out of the bottle if you wish. It has made my skin feel softer and is great for adding shine to my hair.Another use is massaging it into my nails. They are quite brittle but after using this seem less brittle. I have not seen any growth yet, but I have not used this product for this purpose for very long.Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

" 3:39 MinsI have never tried Tamanu Oil but since it was organic, I wanted to give it a try. I am very prone to breakouts and this is supposed to help. I did not see overnight results, however that does not mean it doesn't work.The product is a greenish-brown color and has a nutty smell. While the smell is not unpleasant, it is noticeable. It came with an eye dropper that made it very easy to put a drop or two of the oil on my fingers and then transfer to my face. The oil felt smooth going on and I could feel it drying on my skin. I assume it did remove some of the excess oil from my skin because it kind of felt that way but it did not dry my skin out.The bottle states it is good for a wide range of skin conditions but I do not feel like I have had it long enough at this point to say yes it works or no it does not.I will say this is a high quality product and if you are looking for a Tamanu Oil, I recommend this one.Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

" 3:54 MinsThis is a high quality, cold pressed, grade A Sweet Almond Oil that I will use for diluting 100% essential oils for massage purposes. I will also use it for making bath and body products. I am very happy with the quality and the light scent of this product. It is rich in vitamins A, B and E making it an excellent oil for all kinds of uses on the skin.It is known to stimulate the skin and help renew skin skills thus reducing the signs of aging. It is a great body oil and leave-in hair conditioner. I often add a drop or two of rosemary oil to it and massage that into my hair and scalp. I have dark hair and the benefits are quite noticeable.I can tell I have used an oil on my skin because of the softer feeling but it is not greasy like some products I have tried.The only ingredient is pure sweet almond oil, which I appreciate. The flip cap it came with was very nice because It makes using the product easier.This is also a great product to use on dry skin. Try adding a drop or two to your bath water - but remember oil can make the tub slippery so use caution!This is a great product and the fact that it is cold pressed makes it one of the highest quality sweet almond oils you can get.Disclaimer: I did receive this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

" 6:37 MinsAs with all Ozeri products I have tried, the CardioTech Pro Series Blood Pressure Monitor is durable and as far as I can tell, accurate. As stated in my video I have not had a chance to have this calibrated at my doctors office, but the reading it took did seem correct.I appreciate that this came with two triple A batteries - and a very nice storage case. The company took care to wrap the monitor in bubble wrap before putting it into the case and I appreciate that.The velcro is large enough that attaching the band is not an issue - and neither is removing it from your wrist. I was not afraid that I would rip the velcro off.The batteries are easy to install and I appreciated the + and - signs so I clearly knew which battery went in which way. The battery compartment was easy to remove and reattach as well.Wrist monitors are often easier to use than the standard arm monitors. I really like this monitor. I found all the buttons easy to push and they were clearly marked. While I did read over the instruction manual, I did not do so before my first use. I wanted to see if someone who had no idea how to use one could do it. Very easy to operate!Everyone should have a blood pressure monitor in their home because you just never know when you might need it. I recommend this one.Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

" 4:34 MinsI love baking and learning how to make new foods. I wanted the moon cake molds for the designs more than anything else, but once they arrived and I began to research how to use them, I was intrigued by the thought of making real moon cakes - something I have never seen. Of course, moon cakes are not the only thing this mold is good for making. Use it to make pretty stamped cookies - or fondant - or gumpaste decorations for cakes or cookies. Use it to make all kinds of desserts - even mini pies.The ABS/BPA free food grade plastic the mold is made of is plenty thick and durable so it will last for years to come. The plunger itself is metal with a  high quality stainless steel spring. It is easy to push up and down even though I have arthritis in my hands.The depth of the designs are thick enough that baking is not going to eliminate them. I am very impressed with the quality of this mold.It does take some effort to switch the molds out but this is a plus because they are not going to just fall out while you are pressing your design.I am very happy with my purchase.Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

"PROS:See below, but in short, gets the deep stuff and is safe for planes.Smells good.Strips wax down to the paint.CONS:Strips wax down to the paint.At $17/gallon, it’s expensive (yes, I know it’s a concentrate).Leaves a film if you’re not careful.As a concentrate, you have to mix it yourself and have a separate bottle.CONCLUSION:Any plane owner, without a doubt, should have this in their arsenal of cleaning supplies.THE STORY:I own three aircraft and I like to keep them sparkling clean. I have several cleaning agents that I use regularly, including:Windex, Plexi-Glass Cleaner, Goof Off and good ol' 100LL (plane gasoline).Windex is great for the bug guts. Windshield gets the Plexi-specific cleaner. 100LL for the oil/belly spray and Goof Off for the really hard to remove stuff. I use this sparingly as it likes to take paint with it...So I bought the Simple Green to see what, of the above, it could replace. My initial results, even in high concentrations, were not spectacular. Also, it leaves a surface film I wasn't impressed with.So there it sat on my shelf for five months, rarely used.Now, however, I have seen the light. I had some staining in the paint that a) I couldn't figure out and b) couldn't remove. None of the above products would remove this rainstreak-like staining that was on my tailcone. Even a coat of cleaner-wax wouldn't touch it.So I loaded up a new spray bottle with 1:2 concentrate of Simple Green Aviation. I could not believe the results when it ate right through it and left perfectly clean, bright white paint. So white, in fact, that it makes the rest of the plane look dull.So then I attacked directly behind the plane's exhaust tips, an area brown with grime and exhaust spray. This I’ve, after several repeated attempts at removal, always assumed was permanent. Well, it did take five applications (and wipings) of Simple Green 1:2, but it finally came out. I then quickly wiped the entire fuselage of the plane down and oh man does it pop now.So, in the proper concentration (and repeated applications if necessary), this definitely does the job when even caustic agents won't. I'm a believer now, for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UXJOZMAMKBVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VXU7OE#wasThisHelpful","R3UXJOZMAMKBVO","A2JF94G7O0EV2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JF94G7O0EV2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had a nice five star review written for this phone, submitted to Amazon after only a few days of ownership.However, I now feel obligated to reduce it to a one-star rating.The phone, which I barely use since it's a backup to my primary smart phone, is suffering from several reboots throughout the day. This is when the phone is just sitting idle, on a call or on a txt. It doesn't care. Reboots.The battery life is much worse than I was expecting. I was expecting idle standby of around one week. Instead it's about 48 hours. That just doesn't cut it for a dumb phone.I wanted a simple, RELIABLE dumb phone and went with Samsung since it's such a big name.

"I've had my A6 for over two years now, purchased from Amazon.PROS:I have no other portables to compare this to, but RX battery life seems good if you want to use it as a scanner. Mine sat for around 18 hours and was still going strong RX'ing. Didn't try TX'ing, but know the battery wouldn't have handled it well.Backlight is nice.CONS:Like everyone else says, the interface is extremely counterintuitive. After two years, I still get confused by it. The biggest issue is channel selection. The buttons you'd think would allow you to switch between saved channels in fact switches between recent channels. Setting saved channel and alphanumeric names requires the owner's manual, no way around it. Just a screwy way to do things. Buttons that have two commands (alternate command activated via the Function key) are backwards. The more common command requires Function + Button and the less common command is just Button. Things like that really bring this radio down.The unit comes with a now-antiquated NIMH battery which carries all the burdens associated with NIMH. Doesn't hold a good charge and because TX requires much more juice, you can often RX all day, but won't be able to TX unless it's fully topped off.Just recently a LIPO battery has come on the market, but it's expensive. Fortunately, an alkaline AA adapter is available that replaces the battery pack with six AA batteries. This works much, much better. I'd love to try the new LIPO, though.Branded accessories are ridiculously, yet as expected, expensive. Generics come with the possibility of burning up the radio.The true purpose of this review, though, is to broadcast a fix for a common, frustrating issue: In the air, listening to a non-stop RX such as an ATIS frequency (or even a busy Approach), you'll find the radio cuts the RX off every eight seconds, for half a second. You can search the 'net for others that have this problem. To stop the radio from cutting out, you need to turn the WX ALERT off by pressing Function + Squelch (duhhhhh).CONCLUSION:I would not buy this again, unless I had to. Your choices are fairly limited to the Yaetsu or Sporty's units and maybe some oddballs. I went with ICOM since it's such a big name and I love my ICOM panel mounted radio. This thing, though, is just too goofy.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBD5YQBA1RAKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EU6IF4#wasThisHelpful","RBD5YQBA1RAKY","A2JF94G7O0EV2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JF94G7O0EV2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are drop-in replacements for Lionel's G Gauge model train line. You can either use 6 C-cell batteries or one of these.Versus the C cells, the advantages are:The train is much, much faster with this pack, at least for a short time.Rechargeable and thus environmentally friendly, if that matters to you.Weighs less than 6 C-cells which makes the train much faster.Disadvantages:My batteries are date stamped. They are already over four years old. The kit doesn't appear to have ever been used, but it has sat somewhere for a very long time.The life is a fraction of what the 6 C's offer. Expect a half hour or less on this pack, whereas the 6 C's you'll get hour after hour after hour of solid performance... and the NiCd is super fast for a few minutes, then tapers off dramatically.Very long (10hr) charge time and you have to unplug it. Unlike Lion batteries, which charge quickly and then trickle.Would I do it again?Probably not. I was just curious to see how fast the train would go. Now that I know just how quickly these batteries drain, I'll just stick with C cells... given how long they last, what they cost isn't much of an issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVGN8UFYJR1T8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFXKDXQ#wasThisHelpful","RVGN8UFYJR1T8","A2JF94G7O0EV2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JF94G7O0EV2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a toy G gauge model train... it's the biggest size commonly available. Each car is maybe the size of a ferret or something. Anyhow, these little lights are great for illuminating the interior.I grind the little eye loop off the bottom of the lights with a bench grinder to create a flat surface. Then a dab of super glue and I glue it to the inside of the train car. A quick twist of the light and my interior is illuminated and looks great when playing with the train at night.All my lights were working upon arrival. One was turned on upon opening the package. Some are brighter than others, presumably from weaker batteries.Batteries are replaceable. These are nice, cheap little lights.

"I bought the Lionel G Gauge Snoopy train a few weeks ago. Interestingly, that kit has a tanker and flatcar available separately. The only other individually sold car for the plastic battery-powered G Gauge line is this one. I bought it to help expand my train, which is now up to six or seven total pieces.The only thing left, as far as I can tell, are the passenger cars from the Polar Express kit, but they're not available separately. All the other G Gauge kits are the *same* cars just with different decals. This flat car, with the spools, is the last differently molded plastic car, minus the passenger cars. So it was a good buy in an otherwise limited lineup.Nice car, though it does cost a lot. Spools are removable for you or your toddler to play with.

"It's been 25 years since I've had a model train to play with. And now that I have a 2 y/o running around, I decided it was time to change that. Especially with a Christmas tree purchase coming up soon.I wanted something bigger than the O gauge you see everywhere else. Something that my daughter wouldn't get bored of quite so fast... thinking that bigger is better in that regard.I purchased this after reading all the reviews on the other Lionel G gauge train sets here on Amazon. The Snoopy train is the same thing, just different decals.It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.My word is it big. In reality, I may not have bought G gauge knowing just how big they are. Really, the size of the train itself is fine, but that size makes the track so cumbersome. It will quickly fill up a normal sized front room. Seriously, monster sized. The engine is the size of a small cat.These G gauge trains are presumably geared towards small children. Entirely plastic, more durable, more rough-housing resistant, simpler. Perfect for my needs. Batteries are not included with this kit, though I guess they are/were with the others. However, everyone complains the included batteries were junk, so I guess it's a wash.Assembly was quick, batteries were inserted and away we went. My 2 y/o had the remote understood in seconds. Very simple.PROS:The simplicity and durability of the train and cars seems very nice. While entirely plastic, they don't look cheap and chinsy. I think you could put this train on display and be proud of it.The most impressive thing with the kit, and maybe all trains do this now, is that if you are at full speed forward and your kid throws the remote to full speed reverse, the train slows and realistically comes to a halt, samples a ""coming to a stop train noise"" (sounds totally real) and then slowly picks up speed in reverse. It's probably a 10-15 second process. This is so much better than grinding to a stop and going full bore in reverse.The chugga chugga engine sounds are in sync with the speed of the train, up to and including, full stop, as explained above.CONS:There is a bell and whistle, but no actual smoke. :( No big deal, or a surprise, in this price range.The sounds are clearly recorded and replay in low quality. Higher quality playback would be great.The locomotive itself has no Snoopy livery. It is plain, generic black.The other decals look nice, but are still sort of plain. ""Snoopy Railways"" sounds kind of clunky. No variation of the wording from car to car is boring, as well. More variation in the decals, adding other Peanuts characters would be awesome.In a cost saving measure, it seems like all the G gauge trains are for the most part the exact same plastic, just with different colors and decals.CONCLUSION: I don't know if I would buy G gauge again, at least not without having an entire room dedicated to the train. The train itself is great, it's just too bad the track takes up so much room. If you're after something simple, durable and huge, then you can't go wrong, though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S16KLCR0J0FJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3EY9IW#wasThisHelpful","R1S16KLCR0J0FJ","A2JF94G7O0EV2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JF94G7O0EV2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Multisak seeks to alleviate the issue most dog walkers run into at some point, which is where to keep all the stuff you need.  On a summer's outing, I tend to juggle the leash, poop bags, a toy, treats, water, phone and keys. And the dog.According to it's description, the Multisak should be able to handle most of these easily, but the actual product falls down on the job somewhat.The Multisak has reflectors front and back, to help with night visibility. The bag is lightweight, and can be used with either a standard lead, or retractable leash, by attaching it to the handle and passing the lead through the bag. That part works, well enough, even on my 23' Flexi leash, which is a tad fatter than a standard retractable.  My cell phone, a Motorola Droid 2 Global, also fit in the pocket designated for one, however anything much larger than this model is not going to fit at all. If my phone had an Otterbox or similar bulky case, it would not have fit either.A brand new roll of dog poop bags, Bags On Board  brand, would not quite fit in the pocket meant for a bag roll. The circumference was fine, but the pocket was not deep enough, and the roll threatened to pop out until several bags had been dispensed and the roll shrank.The pocket for hand sanitizer is only suitable for the smallest of tube containers, and would not handle my small travel size Suave without using a stitch ripper to pull out the stitches keeping that pocket narrow. Still, again the pocket was not deep enough for another container I had, as it contours to the round bag, and narrows as the pocket goes down further.There is a thin elastic band with a tiny dog-lead style clip on the end, perhaps meant for keys, mounted in the large inner pocket. The action of the clip is not smooth, and it required two hands and some effort to open it. The problem with the large pocket is that it shares space with a retractable lead. The presence of one makes it not too useful for much else. Even without a retractable lead, the pocket is not big enough for a water bottle, unless the bottle is rather flat, and it would be a struggle to get it in and out past the cell phone and other accessories.If the other  supposed use of this pocket is to hold used poo bags until they can be disposed of, then I would hope that this ... no, scratch that... I would not try to get the bagged output of even the smallest dog through the opening dominated by a cell phone. Or keeping my cellphone in proximity to it afterward. Certainly not my keys, even if I had complete faith in the quality of the bags I used.  Ew.The Multisak is certainly a good idea, but the execution leaves it lacking in enough space to be useful. Unfortunately, the bag doesn't allow enough for the items it's intended to hold, and I was unable to use it for it's purpose. Depending on what you attempt to carry in it, your mileage may vary.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BQUP7OPSBDT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A76UI22#wasThisHelpful","R2BQUP7OPSBDT0","ACTMZJ4EUOC65","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACTMZJ4EUOC65?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a puppy with a picky appetite. I went through the food the breeder sent him home with (Taste of the Wild Grain-Free for Puppy) only to find he refused to eat it. Same thing with Blue Buffalo Wilderness Puppy - and both of these are excellent, well rated foods with high end ingredients.  I tried wet foods, no dice. I tried Canyon Creek Ranch Natural Turkey & Barley Dry Puppy Food and while the puppy ate it, the ingredients spooked me.Finally, I went with the brand that my cat has been thriving on, Wellness. I was happy to see that the ingredients list is full of good things, no grain, no fillers, or other things that would make me worry. The puppy also dances around the food bowl when he sees the kibble scoop come out. He's now in danger of becoming a pig, so I supplement his diet with fresh peas and carrots, which he loves.Another review mentioned gas, which my puppy does indeed have once every few days. This was the same on the other two high end foods, TotW and BBW - I don't know if it's just something common to puppies on high quality kibble. It's not a constant weapon-of-mass-eruptions gas bombardment, but he will issue a silent but deadly at least once a week.  It's not very noteworthy, but all dogs are different and have different reactions to foods at times.The primary ingredient is chicken - and some dogs need a more novel protein to avoid stomach upset and gas, so your mileage may vary.[Edit] On that note, let me add that the Barkspawn's poop never quite firmed up on this food. Finally, in some frustration, I switched again to Blue Buffalo Dry Food for Puppies, Lamb & Oatmeal Recipe. I'm glad to say that the poop report is now clear skies, with chance of clouds (gas!) - that hasn't changed.

The Preppy pens are fragile, the Parker is the one I use most often for letters and the kit pens are my every day writers.The Lamy Safari was a nice economical choice for an alternate pen with a different color ink. I'm using mine right now with Noodler's Red Rattler Eel ink in the Lamy Refill Converter (LZ24) (not included) to mark up a review copy of a document. The eel ink flows smoothly in the Safari, and the stock medium Lamy nib writes with little effort.As far as I know, this pen was offered with out ink or converter - I bought these things separately.The pen itself has a couple of nice features: The grip is notched to make it more comfortable and easy to grip between the thumb and forefinger. The body has a cut out 'window' so you can easily see the amount of ink remaining in the reservoir. The cap snaps on, rather than screws, but I haven't had any issues with the pen drying out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IT3Y5LUSGQXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000R32CFG#wasThisHelpful","R1IT3Y5LUSGQXH","ACTMZJ4EUOC65","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACTMZJ4EUOC65?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not my first Noodler's Ink, but I can already tell it will soon become one of my favorites. For those unfamiliar with Noodler's and find the names slightly confusing (Eels? Bulletproof polar bears? What?!) here's a breakdown on what their names mean:Eel inks are lubricating inks. Polar inks are inks that will still perform in very cold conditions (and not cause havok in your pen due to freezing). Bulletproof (sometimes 'eternal') means that the ink will resist the attempts of a forger to change or remove writing without detection. The Noodler's bulletproof inks will give up when the paper is ready to fall apart, and at that point it's kind of obvious an average forger has been trying their hand at it.I once lost several pages of notes to water damage that were written in J. Herbin's Bleu Nuit and a generic blue-black cartridge refill.  Noodler's does have inks that are even more resistant to more sophisticated forgers (Warden series), but for my purposes, being water and alcohol resistant are all I need.I already own an 'eternal' black (Noodler's Heart of Darkness), but I have stationary that has a brown trim, and I much prefer a matching brown ink. The ink dries slightly lighter than it lays down. It's not so dark that you'd mistake it for a modern true black ink, but it's dark enough that it might pass for a much older 'black' ink that has faded with light and time.Fair warning - Noodler's inks are full almost to the very top. Have a care when you open the bottle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HDHFBPDZ47NL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00362EZE6#wasThisHelpful","R1HDHFBPDZ47NL","ACTMZJ4EUOC65","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACTMZJ4EUOC65?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed a replacement net light set, so I picked up the last set at a local Home Depot store.  Without much expectation for how they twinkled, I plugged them in and wrapped them around my azalea shrubs.The LED Lightshow Starry Night set is a 6' X 4' net with 96 cool-white LEDs, intended for outdoor light displays on shrubbery. Instead of abrupt blinking though, it gradually fades in an out, alternating which bulbs are lit in different patterns. There is no means of changing the pattern, which for my purposes, is fine.This is a beautiful display of twinkling lights.The price from one seller should not deter you however - get them for a more reasonable ~$25 from others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXQV0S69DI4RN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005PBI8T4#wasThisHelpful","RXQV0S69DI4RN","ACTMZJ4EUOC65","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACTMZJ4EUOC65?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a new puppy. He's the crazy, active, adorable, intelligent and mischievous puppy from hell... a barkspawn. He is not, however, a big eater. But active, growing puppies need fuel. Lots of it.  I had him on Blue Buffalo Wilderness Puppy food, and while he liked it better than Taste of the Wild which the breeder sent him home with, he picked at the kibble without great interest, and was slightly underweight. He refused Wellness wet puppy food entirely.I'm not used to picky eaters. His predecessors inhaled Natural Balance kibble and Wellness canned food, and whatever supplements I added to that, but not this little guy. Finally, in some desperation to get some food into him, I picked up a small bag of Canyon Creek at Petco and was rewarded by puppy finally paying attention to what was in his bowl.I don't like the idea of swapping through several varieties of dog food - I'd much rather find one that works for the puppy's needs, tastes, and myself and stick to it. Still, I researched the food while the puppy gained weight, something I didn't have the luxury of doing before my purchase, and I am alarmed enough that I will try another food, Wellness Core Dry for puppies tonight.The ingredients list for canyon Creek is not the best. Way down on the list is menadione (synthetic vitamin K) - a substance the FDA banned from use in human food due to it's links to liver damage and toxicity. Does it seem to have a lot of menadione? No. Do I want my puppy eating it anyway? Hell, no.Also, I get something of a squicky feeling knowing that another of Canyon Creek Ranch's products (Chicken Jerky treats) is under suspicion of containing a potentially deadly ingredient that has caused many pet deaths over the years. When will pet feed companies stop trusting crap ingredients from China? It doesn't give me a warm fuzzy feeling about the company, even though the puppy food has not been mentioned as being at all related.Because of these things, I cannot recommend Canyon Creek Ranch food. The search will have to go on for a puppy food that the barkspawn will eat that I won't worry is slowly killing him.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26VMQT4F0E0B7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KZR67W#wasThisHelpful","R26VMQT4F0E0B7","ACTMZJ4EUOC65","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACTMZJ4EUOC65?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cold Days marks the beginning of the second half of Dresden's saga. If you are new to the series, stop here, go back to Storm Front (The Dresden Files, Book 1), and read your way through the first thirteen books, then Side Jobs, and then come back. I'll wait here. Now  you're up to date, let's go -Preflight checklist: Jim Butcher, one of the best storytellers in modern fantasy, back in the saddle? Check. James Marsters is back as the Audible/audio incarnation of our favorite irreverent, overwhelmed, put upon, wise cracking wizard? Check. Geek/pop culture humor? Check. A crap-ton of magic gets thrown around? Check. The old crew is back in the fight? Check. Harry's up against something far out of his weight class? Check.Harry was only ""mostly dead"" and returns to the realization that he failed to avoid the consequences of the bargain he made with the Queen of Air and Darkness. He is now the Winter Knight, a role that Harry has dreaded for most of the series, and now has to live with. The fae have tortured Harry with their deadly games off and on for 13 books, but it all gets turned up to 11 once he is the Winter Queen's knight.If that's not bad enough, he will have to explain his 'death' and current role to the White Council - and to be clear, that and several related explanations do get sidestepped in Cold Days - There's too many people Harry needs to catch up with to cram it all into one book. Especially since he's got so much on his hands.Demonreach, the island he has attuned himself to, sitting on top of a network of magical ley lines, is about to explode, with enough force to cause Google to update it's satellite photos for the entire western hemisphere. Oh, and Mab's first task for Harry? No less than the assassination of the Winter Queen That Will Be - her own heir and daughter, Maeve.Everything's on the line again, and the only help Harry will find is in the form of his core posse - Thomas, the New and Improved apprentice Molly (now, with less crazy!), Karin, Toot Toot (and the Za Lord's army) and his dog Mouse all sign up for the fight. But the fight is never what Harry thinks it is.A lot of reveal in Cold Days about the neverending battle in the Fae lands, and the relationship between the Winter and Summer courts, and the Council Gatekeeper. The big picture starts to come into focus, and you, along with Harry, begin to realize the very, very deep waters the series is about to sail into. The stakes have gotten much higher. But with that comes the possibility that Butcher may wind up staging a world-as-we-know-it-ends-here apocalypse with every future installment, and that can wear out the novelty and interest of huge battles that threaten to turn into repeats.Which brings up what I didn't like about Cold Days. For the first time, Butcher disappoints by retracing territory he's covered before, and fairly thoroughly. Power not wholly Harry's own is used out of necessity, and with it comes the corruption of thoughts also not wholly his own. Dresden spent a number of books with a fallen angel infesting his every thought, giving him power beyond his own (hellfire), only now Lashiel has been replaced by the mantle of the Winter Knight and powers of winter cold and ice. He is tempted with power yet again - not power that he craves for himself, but power he needs to protect the people he loves, and the millions of innocent bystanders who will die if he doesn't. If you remember the Blackened Denarians story arc, this is playing out in very similar fashion so far. Temptation, power, corrupted thoughts, isolation, and distrust all come back in play in Harry's interpersonal relationships. I can't help but feel disappointed at this development. Why revisit this theme and angst again?Next theme is that Harry, out of fear for his friends, will try to buffer them from a lot of uncomfortable truths. In their emotional reunion, Thomas lampshades this, and seems to accept it as part of his brother's personality, though he works on trying to convince him to open his heart to the people dearest to him (Karin and Maggie).Finally, the Karin/Harry issue gets sent back through the wash cycle for another spin. With a dash of Molly thrown in to complicate matters. I would be very disappointed if Harry went down the Molly path romantically, for the very reasons that Harry himself has given in several books. However, the spectre of this possibility becomes far more possible in future installments after the dramatic conclusion of the events in Cold Days.Supposedly, Ghost Story was the middle of the Dresden series, so I anticipate that Cold Days should set the stage for the plot lines that follow.Buckle up. Or, as Murphy says ""Get on the back, *itch!""It's going to be a helluva ride.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DMOFODAUS9I1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2ZIR7G#wasThisHelpful","R1DMOFODAUS9I1","ACTMZJ4EUOC65","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACTMZJ4EUOC65?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently found a game from my childhood, Dragonmaster, that I immediately broke out and started to play with friends. I quickly realized that the cards would accumulate wear rapidly if I didn't find a way to protect them. Fast.The cards are larger than the standard playing card, or collectible card game. They are more like tarot cards in size. This sleeve is perfectly sized at 70mm X 120mm (2.75"" X 4.72"") for this kind of card.It's clear on both sides, so cards with elaborate backs, or printed on both  sides are still useful, which means it's perfect for a thirty year old game, that uses tarot sized cards. It does make fan shuffling difficult, but the easy glide of the sleeves means that you can jog-shuffle a short deck together relatively quickly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN5VZ9XCXFMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616614439#wasThisHelpful","RN5VZ9XCXFMF","ACTMZJ4EUOC65","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACTMZJ4EUOC65?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game first fell into my hands thirty years ago, and it was an instant hit in my family, and when I unearthed it from the bottom of my desk last week, it was a hit again.Dragonmaster is a fantasy card game from Milton Bradley, long out of print. The game is a trick taking 3 to 4 person card game consisting of four rounds, with five games per round, with plastic gems used as currency. The play style is not unlike an odd cross between spades and hearts. Fair warning - neither the plastic gems, nor the cards are highly durable. The gems will get chipped and cloudy over time - I use glass counters like those used in M:TG and other card games. The cards will begin to split over time as well, but very quickly, the art will begin to wear with normal use. Protect them with card sleeves.The cards themselves look something like tarot cards, and are beautiful portraits in a soft style and color. The art is stunning, and the suits Dragonlords, Druids, Warriors and Nomads are all in their own themes. The cards however are *old* and can easily be damaged. I got large protective sleeves to stop white spots from rubbing into the surface from friction during normal play. The spots started to appear after only a couple of games on a wooden table.Each round starts with a Dragonmaster, and the object of the game is to accumulate the most gems by taking tricks, or forcing other people to take tricks, depending on which game is being played. The Dragonmaster controls the course of the game, but it doesn't guarantee he or she will win the game they have chosen.There are three play levels: Basic, Advanced and Expert. In expert games, other players can wrest control of a round from the current Dragonmaster by running a Power Play, and potentially gaining more gems.Basic is great for the whole family to play, but it will take teens and up to fully realize the fun of playing expert and advanced modes, which can get fairly competitive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJQC1FMJ7TJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000K4UODY#wasThisHelpful","R3BJQC1FMJ7TJ8","ACTMZJ4EUOC65","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACTMZJ4EUOC65?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Square Enix merchandizing out yonder in Japan came out with an actual Mass Effect 3 series of figures, not to be confused with the ""Mass Effect 3"" line from Big Fish that are actually the likenesses of Mass Effect 2 characters.Square Enix (SE) Garrus is head and shoulders taller than Big Fish (BF) Garrus, and is considerably more poseable, with more flexible joints that allow a more natural movement. If you want to call anything about a scifi character wearing plate armor, who looks like his nearest relative is a dragon, ""natural"".SE Garrus lacks any kind of a base, so if, like me, you prefer your action figures to be 'free range' rather than displayed for all eternity in their original packaging, you'll have to test his reach and flexibility yourself to get him upright and balanced.  For a guy who supposedly has a stick up his butt as backup ammo, he could be a bit stiffer. That's the only quibble I have - lacking a base, stiffer joints might make for a wider range of standing poses for this figure.It took a few minutes of sorting him out to get him into a nicely dynamic pose wielding one of the two weapons he came with. He also has an extra pair of hands(because who couldn't use an extra set of hands?), though I have not tried to swap them out. I was sorry that of the two weapons he came with neither were the Widow (that BF Garrus has) or my beloved Mantis. Instead he carries a M29 Incisor sniper and an M15 Vindicator assault rifle. Sorry - no way to attach one to his back when not in use.In short, Square made a more dynamic figure, with a range of natural motion in all the joints, which the Big Fish version is not capable of. No stand, but Garrus stands on his own, towering over the BF figure.  Square Enix is also coming out with a number of other ME3 characters, including FemShep (Halleluja!) for all of us who have never pictured Sheploo as our favorite Commander.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R4DASF7Y9I3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VZWBX6#wasThisHelpful","R3R4DASF7Y9I3N","ACTMZJ4EUOC65","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACTMZJ4EUOC65?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tessa Cutter went to Manhattan to chase her artistic dreams . She comes home to visit her family and when home she makes up the perfect pretend boyfriend—who lives in NYC who is wonderful, handsome and successful. Logan Ridley, who is sort of down on his luck when his personal training studio shut down but he was told of a job that where there is an opening- as a gyn teacher in Cutter’s Creek. Small town life- different from the Big Apple. Everywhere he goes, he hears about Tessa. He was looking forward to meeting her but when he did, she was horrible to him. And the book just went sideways from there. I get it, She comes home and it seems like everyone wants to keep “the baby” of the bunch little forever but that wasn’t the case. And here is this great guy and he is new to town and he gets the sharp edge of her tongue…it just fell flat for me. Even the ending , which seemed sort of rushed, didn’t fix the impression but Logan was a sweetheart of a hero and I loved his character. Tessa needed to grow up or she needed someone to really explain a few things.

"Great story about Gen Richards, who has been blind all her life and Chance Anderson the guy who has had a crush on her for a long time. There was an “incident” in the past and he has been not allowed near her since she was about 15//16 years old so Gen went from hero worshipping him to hating him. She found out one night that it was him following her around and she sort of blackmailed him into helping her do a “bucket list” of things she wants to do and from there the story beautifully unfolds. Chance has a story of why the “incident” happened and he would love ot set the record straight but getting Gen to believe him and he really has this guilt down pat… their love story unfolds and it is wonderful. Loved the supporting cast and Gen’s brother starts off as a jerk but by the end of the story, he does start to come down off his high horse. This is a winner of a story.

"In the Moon series book #5, this is Jared and Taryn story. Jared Ayers, who is Jason’s older brother, likes the solitary life, works outside and wonders if he ‘ll ever meet his mate…that all changes when he called to do a job at Taryn Goldstone aka Ice Queen of Lake Tahoe’s home. Taryn is a real estate agent and she is known as the Ice Queen because she keeps her emotions under tight control and she rarely touches ANYONE even her young son. Its sad but true and the reason is because she is a gifted psychic with pyrokinesis ability and one slip and someone could get hurt or even killed.Jared comes for the job, he takes one look and his wolf gets one smell and its on. When Jason touched Taryn his wolf claimed her as theirs. She didn’t know how to respond to Jared. She had never really touched her own child. She loved him but to protect him, she never really touched him. There is danger coming because there is a man who is coming for Taryn- a man that the pack is familiar with. There are twists and turns that turn this into a roller coaster ride of a story. The chemistry between Jared and Taryn is great—I loved that Jared saw how out of depth that Taryn was yet he took his time and made sure to put her at east as much as he could and he loved her son and protected them both. There are surprises and a lot of emotion in this story that made this such a great story. Taryn is a good woman who has had a lot of things put to her in her life but we get to see some sassy side of her while Jared is definitely an alpha male who protects those he loves.

"Basically there are about 5 dragon queens in the realm that is story is in and each hold power over the court they “live” in. But that changes when one of those Queens successfully breaks the curse that had stopped the curse that prevented the new Queens from emerging; now there are new Queens everywhere. One is Viola who shifts into a 3 headed dragon-- a horse head which represents her “good” side & a goat head – her evil side plus her own dragon head. Now that she has changed, people are taking advantage of her status and to use her and bend her to their will, one was her boss until she was saved by a dragon task force & put under the care and protection of Sergei.What can I say about Viola—hmm—DOORMAT—she worked to put her husband thru medical school but he cheated on her and left her for a nurse after he got thru medical school. Then after her divorce, her boyfriend she was with took her for everything he could. It was like she had no real redeeming qualities. Then she had this weird thing about knitting-she would go insane if her knitting was harmed. I do not know if this was supposed to be this way , like a character setup but this heroine drove me nuts. Sergei is such a alpha dragon, and I liked him but Viola could have been tamed down a bit or given a bit more sassiness to make up for her doormat –like qualities.

This book is a modern day tale on Cain and Abel's story. In this story, we see our couple trying to recover, get themselves to a place where they can get back on track .Jax is descended from Cain- and he carries a demon inside of him named Azirak who happens to be a royal demon. Now the demon has some ideas that do not conform to the plans that Jax and Sam have—the demon needs to feed on suffering and pain to live-that’s NOT want the MC need when they are trying to stay under the radar to survive. Appearances are never what they seem, especially when certain people want Samantha to play for their ""team"" and will not stop until death make it happen . Jax and Sam plan to not let his happen. There is an added twist by a new species that the author added and there are some new characters and there is a cliffhanger so until book3 which hopefully will let us know how Jax and Sam end up.

"OMG, this was such an emotional and touching piece of writing that at times I had to stop and take a breath. I could feel the MC pain and I could feel the love that they had for each other. I am one of those who loves a teacher/student storyline and when I heard that this is what the book was about, I was all for it. I expected it to be a hot read and this was so different than that. Oh there were hot and sexy moments but really this was more of an emotional read.Bree Jacobs’s home life was a dark world, one she hated. The only place she found peace and some sort of happiness was when she was at school. Her mother was very unstable. She was horribly violent to her daughter. She had no one to talk to, no friends, no life. Her teacher, Axel takes notice and is the one who listens and pays attention. He is a few years older but they instantly connect like no one else. He wants to protect her , he sees her an someone who is being abused but no one really cares. At first it’s strictly innocent and he is there for her, making sure she knows he is there and listens but when she has the flu, he takes her home and cares for her and that when the boundary is crossed. I won’t go into details but its not tawdry but beautiful. You can feel the love between these two people. The story is told in mainly Axel’s viewpoint but at times we hear Bree’s side of things. We see how their relationship goes on and how they try to hide it so he won’t get in trouble but secrets are bound to come out and when that happens Axel ends up losing his job and leaves Bree behind. Heartbreak ensues and there is a separation when Axel leaves—really he has to because of all the turmoil when everyone finds out that that they have been having a relationship. Axel is a strong, loving man and his love is for Bree. His heartbreak is so deep when he leaves her…but he isn’t aware that he is leaving a piece of him behind. Bree is devastated when Axel leaves her. I cried several times while reading this book because the emotions are so real and raw in this story. Years pass and suddenly they are back in each other’s’ lives again. Bree is not the same girl she was years before. She has had to grow up, and all this time she wondered whatever happened to Axel and Axel has gone back to teaching which is how they end up meeting…without giving too much away, there are secrets involved and Bree is scared and hiding everything inside of her. There are twists and turns but the way the story ended was wonderful. I would love to read more in this story and the cast of supporting characters are great. Bree and Axel’s love story was so heartbreaking at times but the HEA was truly fantastic and will grab your heart and this is one romance story that you will remember and read over and over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCWCMJLDAI1HE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01863LM1S#wasThisHelpful","RCWCMJLDAI1HE","A1ZOL59JA86C7Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZOL59JA86C7Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is such a emotional journey of a book; it is not all roses and sunshine. The author writes a story that gripes you inside and out. You will feel the pain of the heroine , Willow, and you want to grab her and just hug her tight. Her path has been one of nothing but one of pain and degradation—and all from her family. Isnt family supposed to love you Well, hers doesn’t and has never loved her, only her mom and she is dead and buried.  She is put down for her weight, she is put down for many of things but what gets me is how vicious they are toward her.Enter Kane Masters in her life. He is a movie star and he sees a woman that he knows he needs in his life immediately. They meet and Kane doesn’t see what Willow sees in the mirror. What he sees is a beautiful, lovely woman who is sexy inside and out. He can tell she is a spitfire waiting to happen. He treats her like the prize, the princess she is.  Willow thinks he is too good to be true but she falls deeper and deeper in love with himThere are a lot of twists and turns in this book- and one major moment that you are left going Omg, WTH?? But like all roller coaster rides, hang on to your seats, the ride will take you on an experience you do not want to miss. I enjoyed reading Willow story. My heart broke for her and I cried so much while reading this book. Angry tears, sad tears, happy tears, confused tears…back to happy tears… There is a lot of emotional drama in the story.  You would think that would overburden the story line but it doesn’t. It works for the plot and the ending is awesome. I cannot say enough good things about this story. She writes this book and shows how we are all unique and pretty in our own ways, and to realize that we our beautiful –This was such a terrific message and so brave for her to share her story. Kudos to her for doing this I hope the author will write stories for Kane’s brother and his female friend. I would like to see them get their own stories.My rating 5.0 stars ********A gifted copy was provided by TRSOR PR for my honest review****","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MDGFNTKAR6JD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017O4W3V8#wasThisHelpful","R3MDGFNTKAR6JD","A1ZOL59JA86C7Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZOL59JA86C7Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"All fun filled nights are usually without consequences, well except if you count the hangover part that you are always aware of will be there the next day. Bu the fun filled nights that always hold the most consequences are when we say "" I will never ......."" because then it always happens !In the latest read from Kandy Shepherd, we meet account Zoe Summer. A week in Bali was meant to be her dream vacation, the one vacation that is meant to replenish her energy and just generally give her back some zest in life. But when the tropical island paradise she's meant to be enjoying is hit by an earthquake, she's trapped. Reading about the heroine being trapped was very realistic and had me in tears. I mean can you image , here you are on a tropical holiday soaking up the sun and voila boom suddenly you're trapped with no escape in sight. Talk about dream jumping into nightmare mode!Anyways , being trapped is the least of her problems, because she his trapped alongside Mitch Bailey, sports star extraordinaire and also the blast from her past! Mitch is high on the thrill of survival, and when there is fear it's always the number one little "" do not do"" that let's couples end up in each other's arms.It 's meant to only be for the night, to simply just get through the rough patch life has dished out, but soon Zoe discovers she's pregnant. Now this adrenaline, fear induced one night only couple have to decide can they do forever and raise their child together, or will one of them start running for that non existent dream of no worries in life?When I stated this read, I did not look at the back blurb, because heck it's Kandy Shepherd 's name on the cover and anyone that knows me well knows I love her books, so why would I read the back?! So I was of course completely knocked for a six when what I thought was a lovely per chance vacation meeting, falling in love after the discovery of pregnancy romance read , got turned up side down into not only one of the most tear-jerkker reads ever but also one of the most exquisite  I have ever read.The tears come from the very realistic fear I experienced when reading about the earthquake, it sent me feeling desperate to climb into the book and save the characters. It's a small earthquake but it's powerfully written, so powerful that I felt every single part of it happening , and thanking my lucky stars that I don't live in a country that's known for shattering earthquakes.The character of Zoe is a very private person, she's not the type to go out and shout out anything and everything on her mind, whereas the character of Mitch lives pretty much smack bam right in the middle of the media. I found it fascinating watching these two try to get to know each other again, and keep it all together, and all the time I was thinking "" Gosh, what happens if these two get dragged into a media circus, would they survive it?"" .A stunning journey of love, self discovery and the beginning to a beautiful, remarkable, passionate love story. I cannot wait for the next Kandy Shepherd masterpiece to enter my life, I love this author's fun , flirty yet so heartfelt and emotionally overwhelming it sends me into fits of tears , writing style.5/5 star review"" Vacation forecast : Sun and fun , with a chance of pregnancy!""** Copy received in exchange for a honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K2N242AIINL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373743432#wasThisHelpful","R3K2N242AIINL5","A2J9CZPAGXNV5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9CZPAGXNV5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love and surprises are found in all kinds of shapes and of course in the most unexpected of places. Much like everyone else in life GP Oliver James knows exactly what his "" perfect bride"" should be like - and vibrant, unconventional new locum Lula Chance is the total opposite of the image in his mind. But if there is one thing I have learned in life , it's that those little images of perfection we create in our minds are never what we expected them to be when they finally do emerge.And for the most part it of course has always left me thinking "" Boy I did not see that coming !"" and also "" Really, that's what this picture is suppose to look like?""So course that is pretty much what Oliver ends up thinking when Lula and all her long list of imperfections she has that so does not fit in with his list , she intrigues him and there seems to not be a thing he can do about it, well except maybe go with the flow.The heartbreak in Lula's eyes are the clinger in this romance, it's what captures Oliver's attention and bounds him to her in such a tightly wrapped bubble of romance there really is no way he can get out of it.But Lula is determined not to be distracted by brooding Oliver, no matter how gorgeous he is or how caring he might seem to be. She's arrived in Atlee Wold hoping to find her mother and Oliver will for darn sure be the distraction from her quest that she cannot afford.  But us romance fans know that giving in to the inevitable is only a matter of time and it's then that the sparks for these two characters really start to light up the night sky. And who knows, just maybe Lula can fit into that perfect little image of perfect bride for Oliver, after-all.This read was one of those that simply shine from start to finish. It had the perfect heroine that 's quirky, different in all the ways real heroines in life are, that for the most part are sometimes completely lost in romance reads. You know the type I am talking about, the "" Really, that's what she just did, which normal person does that?""  As for Oliver , I wanted to grab the nearest bedpan and hit the man over the head. Dreaming up an image of the perfect bride is just about one of the dumbest things in life anyone can do, but I totally enjoyed seeing him get knocked down by Lula and her definitely non-perfect-bride attitude. She puts him in his place and it was totally off the hook awesome!A truly wonderful, captivating read with a beautiful message of life not always being exactly the way we want it to be and of course that all things in life even our perfect images of love and success does not always quite look the way we dreamed them to be, but they are always for darn sure ten times better!5/5 star review"" He sees her, she sees him.

"Keeping out of the spotlight is never easy for any celebrity. It's and endless street of diving into odd little shops when you see anyone pull out a camera and dressing down to try and hide out. In this read from Amy Ruttan we meet senator's daughter Dr. Jennifer Mills, and for her it is just as hard to keep out of the spotlight as it is for Julia Roberts!  Especially after being jilted at the altar by her ex-fiance, guaranteed that's a front page head liner that no one will ever forget.So when arriving in Las Vegas, she's just hoping to blend in. Ha ha ha, everyone and anyone knows that 's never how it works in the city of flashing lights and big time spenders. She meets ER surgeon Nick Rousseau, the same man she spent an unforgettable night with three years earlier.Now returned from Afghanistan, ex army medic Nick is struggling to come to terms with his time on the front-line. Rekindling his romance with Jennifer reminds him that some things in life are still worth fighting for.This was a truly stunning story about two damaged people finding new hope after life has shown them the type of things that are sure to break even the strongest of hero's and heroines in the world.  The story was easy to read with a nice even flow and the nice little add on of a little twist here and there that sent the read from even flow to "" Wow, did that just really happen?"".The character of Jennifer was pretty much as damaged are heroine's can be, the tough life of trying to stay out of the spotlight and trying to get over the hurt and embarrassment of being jilted at the altar. But being damaged as much as other heroines are in these kind of reads did not make her ordinary or boring, in fact she was a breath of fresh air, fun and little too flirty for someone that has to stay out of the spotlight so that her senator father does not end up with more egg on his face then his plate.Nick was the tortured hero that I simply just wanted to hug and tell that everything will be okay as long as he does not give up. The author has once before shown her remarkable talent for showing the true hell and torture those that face war zones have to learn to live with. And oh my gosh he was sexy as hell! I could literately eat this man up! His back and forth battle with his troubled and clearly tortured soul shattered my heart and I cried my eyes out for this hero.I am taking away a message of life knocks you down, sometimes so hard that the ability to get back up seems like a lost cause. But is it really the end of the line? Just as life shows you the cruel hard stuff it will also show you how to get back up, all you need to do is be open to the light that filters through and never ever think staying in the dark and blocking out the sunshine is what you deserve.5/5 star review"" She needs rescuing but what will happen when her hero is the one that needs the rescuing?

"Every normal woman has dreams, even those who are already married to the wealthiest of men, yes even those have a little side line dream of something or someone that would make them happy.  In this absolutely beautifully crafted read from the multi talented Rachel Brimble we meet Monica Danes. She has always wanted more than what the village of Biddlestone had to offer. After a failed courtship to the man of her parent's choosing , she fled for the city of Bath and never looked back. Now she graces the stage and she's the undisputed queen of the theater , a very wealthy and independent woman. But when she is called home in the wake of tragedy, Monica returns but plans to leave again as soon as possible.Thomas Ashby has been a groom at the Danes estate since he was a boy, and has enamored with Monica for almost as long. He knows he isn't a suitable match for his master's daughter , despite the special bond he and Monica has always shared. Not to mention the undeniable attraction.  As Monica re-enters the world she left behind Thomas sees it as his final change prove himself as worthy. He will show Monica a life and love she won't want to give up.This read was filled with such exquisite opulence it was as if I was being transported back in time , a time when romance was pure elegance. Right from the start of the read my heart was pounding with excitement to the point where it would literally feel like it was about to burst of simply jump out of my chest. Yes, I kid you not the excitement was that powerful, this is after all a story written by one of the best romance authors in the world, so it was no surprise, just extremely unhealthy for my poor heart that had to try and keep up with the remarkable magical pace of this read.There was conflict and I do mean real, in your face, cannot be overlooked conflict, none of that dull this is so boring it;s not even real conflict stuff. No, this author brought her A -game when it came to the conflict. I was hanging onto each and every single word , and I literally wanted to be right there to get in on the action.The settings in this read were simply put, absolutely, freaking spectacular! I have always said I wish I lived in another time period, a time when romance had elegance and true meaning, a time when ballgowns where the start of your dreams coming true when looking in the mirror. The author dropped me right into the middle of it all. I could smell the elegance, I could touch the richness, I could hear the exquisite heartbeat of a world set in  a time that sadly has been lost.The characters, were mind blowing, I loved Monica. Her fighting spirit left me with a huge smile on my face and thinking "" That's it, you go girl!"" Thomas was my weakness, I fell hook, line and sinker for this hero, not because he is the absolute prefect example of a true gentleman but because of his feelings for Monica and the manner he uses to try and convince her that he is good enough for her. I wanted to tell him to keep pushing, to keep fighting , and to never let go, and of course I was over the moon with delight and squealed like a happy child on Christmas day when the man proves he is never and I mean never going to give up.From the remarkably crafted settings, being transported back into time, falling in love with the hero, rooting for the heroine,  till the absolutely prefect ending to an incredible read, this read had everything I could wish for when picking up a romance book. It's the romance read of the century !I highly recommend this read for all fans that wish to step back into time and travel on the journey of epic romantic proportions!

"Auditioning for anything in life is the stuff nightmares are made of! If it's dancing you could fall and literally break a leg! If it's a movie audition heck you could end up saying the lines for the wrong movie, anything is possible when a person is nervous.In this read, which comes in at twenty chapters, which I will add were nice and short and not dragged out to the point where I wanted to pull my hair out and end up looking like some bad version of Miley Cyrus, the world of dance is brought to life.The read tells of Ashley and the journey she embarks on fulfilling her dream of becoming a world - class dancer. But as all dreamers know there is always something or someone that stands in the way, for Ashley it's Antonio Machiavelli, and his resounding "" It's a no from me"" is enough to send any wannabe straight into a fit of nightmares.But Ashley is not your everyday "" Okay maybe next time"" kind of wannabe, she fights back by challenging Antonio and takes her anger and rage and channels it into a a on the edge of your seat performance.  Antonio is more than just a little intrigued and very soon it becomes clear that keeping his distance from Ashley will not be as easy and step, step and turn ! And as for Ashley she knows her sole focus needs to be on fulfilling her dream of becoming a lead principal but love makes everything so much harder.I very much enjoyed this little read, I am not a major fan of books that involves dancing but occasionally I do come across one that has all the right moves.  This read is a wonderful journey of two souls meant to be together, and a lovely message of dreams not always being what we think they should be.People change and as they do their dreams have to adjust, of course everyone knows that when our dreams try to tell us it's time for a new kind of dream or for a little different version of our dream, it's not always easy for us to listen. We might have had our dream for so long that it seems impossible to alter it in anyway.The author very nicely showed how dreams can change and that our dreams can still come true but with a little more of a kick along the way than what we expected it to be.A very lovely and heartfelt read that's perfect for a little romantic escape.4.5 star review"" She dances her way into his heart, but will he want her there?""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XCVC1F2MMRXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XRQ2KZC#wasThisHelpful","R2XCVC1F2MMRXD","A2J9CZPAGXNV5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9CZPAGXNV5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every woman heck every man even , has a fantasy they dream about. It's usually in the dead of night when no one is around to hear you accidentally say the dream out loud or do something stupid like make a facial expression that borders on your 'sex face'.In the new Dani Collins read we meet Natalie Adams and we are taken straight into her fantasy when it becomes reality as she embarks on an affair in Paris with infamous billionaire Demitri Makricosta, reality surpasses her wildest dreams and it's a memory she will always treasure.But Demitri has other ideas, one night isn't enough and to quench his new found Natalie-diction he suggests she becomes his mistress. Natalie is course thrown off kilter but show me the woman that will say no to a hot billionaire when she has nothing to lose, but the closer Natalie get's to the emotions that Demtri has carefully locked away the more he distracts her with dazzling gifts and a life of luxury holidays to ensure that seduction is the only that remains between them. But can he really carry on with this little game of seduction only or is Natalie getting to his closed off heart ?The author wrote a very enjoyable read, I very much liked Natalie. She was the kind of heroine most woman think they can be when they get burned in life, but as all woman know, when the time comes it doesn't seem that you are able to really be the person you always told yourself you would be should you get burned. She had spunk but not the overwhelming large dose that some heroine's have, nope just enough to let me know that she will fight to have her little fantasy but she also won't let it shift her focus from her child to the point where she will be a ' it's all about my love life and not what's best for my child' kind of mother .Demitri was of course the typical bastard hero found in the HP line, but he he had a lot more depth than most. The author did a fantastic job of taking this tortured black heart hero with all his emotional closure and turning him into this remarkable man that no woman can resist, and the man certainly had me weak at the knees when he goes from tortured to saved! Loved it!!Strong characters, wonderfully crafted plot and a great ending to a beautiful journey of redemption, self discovery and best of all a stunning message of life being full of surprises and when reality comes knocking it's never what our fantasies were, it's always so much better !Recommended for all fans of Dani Collins books.4.5 star review""Fantasy becomes reality but it's not quite what they expected it to be""** Copy provided in exchange for a honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XUDACE6R114M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373133499#wasThisHelpful","R2XUDACE6R114M","A2J9CZPAGXNV5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9CZPAGXNV5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It starts with a young girl Ruby, she wakes up in a cold, dark cellar, with no recollection how she got there, and so her hellish nightmare begins. Beatings, being starved, shackled to the bed, the list goes on and on.All the while her captor is always one step ahead of DI Helen Grace, who along with her team is slowly gluing all the puzzle pieces together in order to try and bring to justice the monster who has done this kidnapping - killing game not once or even twice before, but three girls have all faced and lost the battle from hell at the hands of a crazed madman.Then as DI Grace and her team start closing in, time runs out for Ruby because her captor has just found his next victim and it's time to throw out the old and bring in the new, it's a deadly race against time for all involved.This was my first time reading this author, but I will be coming back for more. The Doll's house is one of those thrillers that have you looking behind you every few minutes of so and double checking out the people you think you know very well, just to make sure that there is not something hiding behind their smiles.This read has an extremely thrilling fast pace of events, not once does it slow down to a drizzle, nope this author really kept my attention all the way through to the end. And the guessing game in this read was absolutely phenomenal! So many suspects that fit the bill , and then suddenly all is lost and another suspect comes along looking perfect but no the author is not quite content on letting it come together that easily or that quickly, I loved it!Suspense, drama and a whole lot of psycho! Yes this as I said is a read filled with thoughts of really bad things running through your mind, I felt the fear and could taste the bitter disappointment of the police and I for darn sure got the creeps from a truly out of his ever loving mind killer, you know those chills that literally run down your spine and you don't know how to stop them except to stop reading but you can't because the book is that darn good!I highly recommend this read for all fans that love a fast paced, well thought out thriller. Intense and truly good old fashioned on the edge of your seat!*** Copy provided in exchange for a honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JITVGMYNXDWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NCLPGJY#wasThisHelpful","R2JITVGMYNXDWB","A2J9CZPAGXNV5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9CZPAGXNV5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by DesereThe words "" Blame it on....""  have always been the response of most people when they realize they should have known better and there in actual fact is no real excuse, so you grasp at whatever you can.In this read from the very talented Kate Hardy is the champagne getting the blame. At a London salsa club ( sexy as all heck I will add) consultant Aaron Hughes catches sight of the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. He doesn't do relationships but one night of fun with a perfect stranger can't hurt, or can it?Registrar Joni Parker, dancing and sipping champagne is just what the Dr. ordered to remedy her what-would -have-been-wedding -night. Until she finds an even better cure, her very first ever fling! It's excitement overload! But what starts with no strings turns into one big old complication when Aaron walks into the hospital on Monday morning as the new consultant.This was an incredibly sexy read from start to finish I was hooked over and over by the absolutely brilliant chemistry between Aaron and Joni, talk about setting the pages alight! I adored Aaron to absolute bits, all I wanted to do was grab him and keep him to myself. The author gave him the perfect balance of non - committal but willing to try for the right reasons , I loved every minute!!And Joni, oh my gosh my heart shattered into a million pieces for this poor heroine, the author put me front and center for every single drop of emotion this heroine experienced, her heartache, the shame, the hope and the very real reality she had to face.This is one of those reads that if I dare to go on with my review I will without a doubt spoil it, because it's a book that I will ever stop talking about it was that good! So am going to only add that if there is only one medical romance you read this year, make it this one.Emotionally packed, drama filled, shocking revelation filled and a gorgeous romance that tells of hope and new beginnings.5/5 star review"" No strings, just fun, until the Monday after !""** Copy provided in exchange for a honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DQFS4X4LOERH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0263907937#wasThisHelpful","R3DQFS4X4LOERH","A2J9CZPAGXNV5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9CZPAGXNV5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ava Vaughan steps back into a world of glitz, glam and secrecy, a world where she knows she never belonged. But it's necessary if she wants to get her estranged husband to agree to a divorce. After living apart for the last six months the time has come to cut all ties and really start her life over. But she does not expect Cole to say No! Nor does she expect him to kiss her senseless and pretty much knock her off kilter all over again, just like old times.Cole is no where near ready to let his beloved wife walk away, he devises a plan to keep her around for just a little while, in the office, in the kitchen , in his bed and of course in his life, once he is ready to really let go, she can have her divorce but not before he's darn well and ready!Ava agrees to live with Cole again and work at his firm as the planner of a major event, once the event it done and dusted she can get back to her life and of course she will have the divorce. But as time passes old feelings rise to the surface, feelings of heartache and loss, of unbearable pain and despair, and feelings of the overwhelming never ending desire they both feel.  But as much as Ava has and still loves Cole he never has nor will he ever love her, so why stick around?Two hours was all it took to read this fabulous little read, yes two hours is all it took for me to fall hopelessly in love with these two lost souls that were so badly in need of guidance. And guide them the author did ,with spectacular fashion!The character of Cole is of course every romance reader's worse nightmare, a real ass, arrogant, demanding and always issuing orders to get his way, but let's be honest gals that's what us lovers of romance wants. We want a hero that will be pushed into a corner till they spill it all ! And spill he did, not the secrets about Freemasonry of course but definitely everything I wanted him to!  Btw Nicole the entire secrecy of Freemasonry , SUPER SEXY!The character of Ava was lost, and I mean really lost as in drowning in a sea of denial, sorrow and all I wanted to do was hug her, and tell her to get her ducks in a row, but as the read went on I was able to really understand why she's so lost and not willing to get anything in a row and rather head for the easier route of divorce.This being the prequel to the Freemasons series it was short but so very powerful. Fast paced, loaded with emotion and left quite the impact on me. A stunning read about two people who were never meant to be apart, slipping back into their comfort zone with the barriers from the past only half way in place and then the power of love knocking down each and every single one of those barriers. Passionate, heartfelt, remarkable and compelling are just some of the words that come to mind, the book is a whole lot more and simply one that is not to be missed.I am literally already going out of my mind crazy waiting for book two of this series and I only read this one a few hours ago!

"Boston Detective,Jane Rizoli is on the case of a big game hunter found dead in his apartment, alone with the body of a beautiful snow leopard he had recently been commissioned to procure and stuff for a high-profile museum in the area.Medical examiner Maura Isles connects the case to a number of seemingly unrelated deaths where the victims have all been found hanging upside down, the hallmark of a leopard's kill.Rizzoli follows the puzzling mystery all the way to Botswana, where she uncovers the unsolved mystery of a deadly camping safari four years prior. When she realizes the two cases are connected Rizzoli must track down the sole survivor of the tragic trip to discover who, or what is behind these gruesome deaths. Getting the sole survivor to help trap the killer is a whole other scenario.From the blurb the book sounds intriguing and like a real page turner. It starts interestingly enough and grabbed my attention but very shortly after fell flat, it was like the author lost the plot somehow before picking it up again. Now of course this is my first time reading anything from this author and therefore am willing to freely admit that maybe it's just me and this could of course just be the author's writing style.When I got to chapter 5 it picked up momentum and the author recaptured my attention  and the read became really enthralling hence the four star review and the fact that after it picked up again I could not put it down and four hours later found it all done and dusted.The characters were intriguing and mysterious , just the way you would expect them to be in this category of reading and definitely gory enough to make even the most addicted of fans cringe with disgust.I recommend this read for fans that like a bit of legend connected in their mystery and thriller reads, sadly for me I solved the case too long before the end and would have liked if the read was a little less predictable.All in all a good afternoon pass-time for those looking to step foot into the world of mystery and murder for a few hours.4 star review"" He tried to kill her once, will he fail again this time around?""** Copy provided by Penguin Random Houes Books South Africa** Copy provided in exchange for a honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP13XMLG6HAOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345543858#wasThisHelpful","RP13XMLG6HAOJ","A2J9CZPAGXNV5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9CZPAGXNV5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who doesn't love a Christmas wedding, and when written by one of today's best selling authors , it's total perfection!Single mom and Chef Lizzie Dumont is moving on, returning to Dolphin Bay to make a her new restaurant a success. And therefore has absolutely no time whatsoever for Mr Jaw-dropping handsome Jesse Morgan! But forgetting that incredible kiss they once shared, is not quite as easy.Jesse can't forget their kiss either but the betrayal in Lizzie's past has made her wary of him, and he hates that she cannot see past his reputation as a heart-breaker. So now he's on a mission, a mission to change her mind and get her to be the Christmas present he has always wanted.I love this author's books and this one arrived during a very stressful part of my life . Knowing that this author's work is always guaranteed to cheer me up , I dug in the second life allowed me to do so. And it completely worked, for four hours I was able to escape life and at the end of the read walk away from the read with a new found feeling of hope and knowing that everything happens for a reason and in the end there will always be a light somehow , somewhere all you need is to be able to look for the light while you're stuck in the darkness.I loved the vibrant characters and most especially their flaws , the author did a remarkable job at showing that these characters are just like the people we see , hear about and meet everyday. They are simply people who have made mistakes, taking the wrong turn and have to fight to find a way back to the point where their happiness starts.It's a story about leaning to move past the moment from the past that is holding you back, it's about learning how to look past what you hear about a person and rather trust yourself to see a person through your own eyes instead of the image the world has conjured up.I highly recommend this read for all fans who love romances reads that shines like a bright diamond during the darkest of hours.

Before you can say truth of dare these two reach a crossroad, it's time for a new kind of dare : real, forever love.Fabulously hot sexual tension , riveting emotion and kick ass conflict, this book had it all!  I adored the character of Tyler. A really honest to goodness nice guy always doing the right thing even when it hurts like hell. I fell hook line and sinker for this hero from the start go. Through his character the author showed it is always best to do the right thing, yes it hurts and afterwards you wish you never did it in the first place but somewhere along the line it's going to pay off. The trick is to be able to know when to hold out for that moment to arrive instead of simply just doing the opposite of what you know is right so that it does not hurt so bad.The character of Maggie was really fun, I liked her feisty spirit and get go attitude even though she had been let down in the past she still pushed for what she knew she had to have. Of course as we all know being hurt in the past does not make it a smooth ride at all and therefore I could identify with her insecurities. Through this character the author showed we all get moments of doubt but when you love someone that love is always stronger than the doubt and can be overcome.I am taking away a message of life has a way of daring us to get out there and take on the unexpected, it results in happiness and sadness in the end you either win or lose but either way you will know you tried and that is more than what other's ever do.

"For ten years Pip Martin has been pushing the limits pursuing a prestigious career in New York. Then she returns to Yorke Peninsula to say farewell to her dying grandmother. She doesn't want to linger, she wants to get into town unseen, say goodbye to her grandmother, say hi to her best friends and then get out and back to her perfect happy life in New York, which not only includes the perfect job but the perfect sexy hot friend Chad , that comes with all the right benefits a climb to the top of the corporate ladder girl like her needs.But life is never that simple and not only is the whole town aware of her arrival, but so is her childhood sweetheart, Luke Trenorden. He was her everything, until the night he betrayed her and tore their lives apart.Seeing Luke again awakens the feelings from the past, but it also brings back the memories of a long kept secret, a secret she has been trying to solve for far too long. Then the answer is revealed and Pip has to decide is she 's going to go back to being the corporate goal getting career woman she's become or if she's ready to be the woman she was meant to be, the one only Luke can see.This read was all about stunning emotion, that drew me in from the first page and held my attention right through to the end. I laughed and I cried my eyes out , and I got my heart broken over and over again, and then the author pieced me back together again with remarkable wonder.I adored the character of Luke, he's the kind of hero that deserves happiness but every time it is or has been in reach something happens to tear it away, and this completely broke my heart. I wanted to grab hold of this man and hug him tight, tell him it will all be okay he just needs to hang in there. But as we all know, saying the words never really means anything because they are just words. Through this character the author showed that when we believe that everything we do is wrong and happiness is not in the cards for us, it's one of the biggest mistakes we can make, because it 's not us but life's way of steering us to where we need to be or in the case of Luke keeping us where we are meant to be so that we are there for the one that needs us the most when the time comes.The character of Pip was at first the really, "" Oh man a stuck up NY diva heroine"". And I did not immediately like her at all. But as the read progressed and the author let me in on her past I could clearly start to see why she's so focused on her career instead of happiness. It broke my heart when the author revealed the hurt she had face in the past. Through this character the author showed how the hurt from the past is essential in life to teach us what we should be reaching for. We lose our way but when life offers up the right goals we should be chasing , the trick is to stop, listen and then act instead of ignoring the signs and simply sticking to the game of pushing for what we want instead of what we need.This book was filled with so many wonderful emotions, brought to life with vivid color by the author. It tells the journey of self discovery, romance rekindled, lessons learned, secrets and mystery keeping people apart and bringing forth a new life for all.I recommend this read for all fans of reading. Deep emotion that will bring you many tears of joy and sorrow, give you a new zest for life, have you believing in love, friendship, family and teach you that the past is simply that, what's in the past is not what will bring you the future you deserve, it's about letting go and chasing the dreams of your heart and not those bouncing around in your mind.

He doesn't want a relationship, neither does she, it's perfect, let lose,  have great sex and then cut loose. Easy right?I very much enjoyed this read, the little spark of conflict here and there was great entertainment. I adored the passionate attraction between Finn and Callie, it was like reading about firecrackers going up in the air, exploding and then suddenly re-exploding all over again, super hot!The character of Callie was really fun and made the read very lively. Her sparkling, go with the flow, make the best of every situation attitude had me in stitches the one minute but breaking my heart the next, because I knew it was only a form of defense against hurt.  I loved that the author showed how we all have different ways of coping, but that at some point no matter what form of coping mechanism we use it simply falls flat.The character of Finn, was awesome! I loved his free spirited persona. I really enjoyed him trying not to fester on the past and his relationship failure, and instead try to be more like Callie by just going with the flow and enjoying the moment. What really got to me was how the author let him push Callie to talk about her past, but still keep it light and simple enough to make it still sound all about sex and nothing more, not the perfect scenario for any woman, but it totally worked because it kept the read fun and added that certain level of sexiness with a twist all the while entertaining me as the author only here and there hinted into his past and what would ultimately get him to reveal all to Callie.The backdrop settings were described with exquisite detail and I could actually hear the lions roaring and felt the cool night air touch my skin.  I am taking away a message of when it comes to any relationship , one that's just for sexual fun or a very real this is us in it for the long haul one, you always need to lay out all your cards on the table, if you don't you will never win.  There will always be another winner, another game but if you don't give it all up, you will always walk away as the looser.I recommend this read for all fans that love a romance with a fun and crazy plot , terrific characters, great emotion and fabulous hot passion.

"I have personally always been a major fan of daredevils, the pure thrill and excitement of these badboys is addictive. So of course I was thrilled when I learned that this read had such a hero, and my oh my what a hero he was!The read introduces us to Rafael Revaldi, he has always lived for the moment, then his whole life changes when he cheats death. This leads him to know exactly what he wants, and that is an heir. But to make it happen he has to focus all his attention on winning back the heart of his estranged wife Lottie.Lottie returns to the castle she once called home, but with her she brings a newfound strength , she's not the same woman she use to be and she 'll be darned if she goes down without a fight again, if only she can carry her strength to full.The intense sensual connection between her and Rafe is still there and it's hotter then ever, but the emotional scars from their marriage still lingers. Can she stand her ground and walk away from heartache and pain or will she once again lose her heart when if she fails to give them both the child they both so desperately want?I adored this read to pieces, the raw emotional hurt from the characters had me in tears for the best part of the book, which of course is always a definite sign that an author knows what she or he is doing! The characters of Rafe and Lottie both pulled my hearstrings to the point where  I honestly wished I could climb inside the book and just fix it all, the author let the hurt, anger and pain play out perfectly, it was truly as if I was right there watching the characters tear each other to pieces.Through both characters the author showed , that we all react differently when life fails us, some of us lash out, others simply go into a little cocoon of self defense. But at the end of the day which ever action we take hurts our changes of being able to really get back up again, stand our ground and let the world know we are stronger then what ever life trows at us.The cold hearted method taken by Rafe to inform Lottie of his decision was one written so well it sent chills down my spine, and of course I thought "" What a bastard! "" and then I wondered what really lurks behind the cold man of steel? And let me tell you when the author began digging into the past of these characters and the cold hearted methods they both take, I was an absolute mess, I bawled like a baby, I shouted in outrage and I yelled with frustration, so many various emotions ran through me and without a doubt this author got to my heart and soul!I am taking away a message of life can knock us down so badly it feels as if there is simply no way back up again. But the trick is to find the right balance to get back up again, you can pretend all is fine and make everyone believe you 're having a high old time, but when you are alone the darkness overcomes you.  There is a thin line between getting back up to the point where you are able to move on without regrets and accept life for what it is, and getting back up but still leaving a part of you on the ground begging for help. Never give up, always fight and most importantly communicate and tell the truth to those that matter, if you don't there simply is really no way you will ever fully get back up again and be able to face life.I highly recommend this read for all fans of romance reads with amazing twists and turns, pure raw emotional heartache , stunning passion and a wonderful message of love conquering all.A brilliant debut Andie!5/5 star review"" Death tore them apart, can a new life will bring them together?

"This is book number eight in the Mills and Boon The Chatsfield series, this time we meet the eldest of the Chatsfield's.Lucilla has always been the one to keep the family together, taken care of everything she could, which of course is a great responsibility and as we all know , with great responsibility comes great sacrifice.Lucilla has never really stopped to look for love, she is simply jut too busy trying to keep it all together, she faces each day head on and let's nothing stand in her way. That is until the force that is Christos Giatrakos. Not only has he been put in charge of the family business but also in charge of Lucilla.She's naturally outraged and vows to fight back with all she has. But Christos is not the kind to back down and simply roll over. Although returning back to a world he never wanted to step foot into again, he's prepared to do whatever it takes to reach his end goal.And right here is where this read shouts, clash of the titans, game on! I loved the conflict in this read, it was fun one minute and spicy the next. It did resemble other reads in the same line, because there is always conflict, but the author let it somehow play out with more passion and the conflict alone took on a life of it's own, making this read highly entertaining.The characters were both extremely well written, both determined and forceful in everything they do, and of course the heat building in between the bouts of anger was fabulous!Not wanting to spoil the read for anyone, I can't say too much more except that the ending of this read was as perfect as they come, and took my breath away.I am taking away a message of to walk away from problems is never the answer, yes it is the easy solution but can you really escape? The answer is definitely no, because somewhere alone the line the problems are going to break through the defenses you lined up and you will need to face it, so why run in the first place, deal with it instead the minute it arrives because if you walk away you are walking into a world far worse than the problems you had to face in the past.I highly recommend this read for all fans of romance reads, it was a roller coaster of conflict, passion, glitz and glam and sexy romance., and by far my favorite from the entire series.5/5 star review"" The fight to gain control is on,but who will walk away as the winner?""** Copy store bought","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FI9H4FRWW1WW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0XO4EY#wasThisHelpful","R2FI9H4FRWW1WW","A2J9CZPAGXNV5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9CZPAGXNV5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am sure everyone will agree with me when I say , when Christmas day has come and gone you still wish you could somehow get that warm, christmassy feeling back and keep it alive somehow.I for one wish all year around that I could somehow capture that magic feeling, keep it in a bottle and open it when ever the year starts to feel a little too much.  I am ecstatic to report I have found something even better!Snowbound Summer was Christmas magic wrapped up with a big old red bow ready to be unwrapped again and again , no matter the time of year.The read tells of Summer, reeling with regret over her failed business and the end of what seemed like the perfect relationship, she's back home and hiding out in her parents house. She wants nothing more than to consume as much chocolate and wine as possible and have some peace and quite.But fate intervenes in the form of the most adorable dog ever written. Cold, trapped in the shed and clearly injured, is where Summer finds the dog that will ultimately become the best thing that has ever happened to her. She calls in the help of the local vet, only when she discovers he's none other than he brother's best friend, Nick, and that he has to stay the night due to one heck of a snowstorm, does she start to see him a whole new, sexier light, only she's not ready to tell him the whole truth and nothing but the truth.As I said earlier this book was Christmas magic, from the miracle of saving furry friends lives to holiday romance blossoming and even Christmas day lunch giving way to a whole new meaning to"" We really should be discussing this in private and not at the dinner table"", it all came together beautifully.I could not put the read down, from the opening scene right through till the end the author delivered romance entertainment ! Through the character of Nick she showed that we all have hopes and dreams and sometimes the only way to find out if we can make them happen is to take action and hope for the best outcome.Through the character of Summer the author showed that we are all definitely human, we all make mistakes and we all get up and move on, yes it takes others longer to get over a mistake but eventually we get there. But more importantly there is no shame in failing, everyone does at some point and it's okay.I am taking away a message of everything in life happens for a reason , and at the right time. Of course we none of it makes sense whilst it is happening, I mean would you think rescuing a dog would bring you the love of your life? I for darn sure would not even begin to think it, I love animals but adding that to romance , not the first thing that comes to mind at all.But as with all life lessons it's afterwards the light always shines through and the meaning becomes clear, the trick is not to want to run and hide. It might be a natural instinct but it's the wrong approach try to see it for what it could be and not for the "" This is so not what I need right now!"".I recommend this read for all fans of romance reads, it's the perfect pick me up read for anytime of year and definitely perfect for the holidays . The read will be keeping my christmassy feeling alive and well for the year that lies ahead.A story about hope, love, understanding and acceptance.4.5 star review""A lonely dog, a sexy vet and a Michelin star chef find happiness under the Christmas tree""* Copy provided in exchange for a honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ZEWJFIOD6DV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RDOWW2U#wasThisHelpful","R33ZEWJFIOD6DV","A2J9CZPAGXNV5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9CZPAGXNV5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was the very first book I read by this author, and after this absolutely brilliant romance it certainly will not be the last.The author created a stunning story of wanting to feel safe and protected against harm, feeling protected against love is a whole other story of course. When someone loves us you don't expect them to hurt you. The scenes where the physical abuse was described was hard to read, I simply could not imagine anyone doing such unspeakable things to another human being.But the long road she travels to bring the abuse to and end and become a stronger person, was amazing and made the tears I shed completely worth it!*** Store bought copy","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17EEPTJLMQ0X3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JTHXOK#wasThisHelpful","R17EEPTJLMQ0X3","A2J9CZPAGXNV5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9CZPAGXNV5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not terribly thrilled with this item. After reading the reviews I was able to get a size larger than I normally would wear, so at least mine fit. It runs at least a size small. It is also very short, so waits to just above my belly button, covering only the small part of my back. The material it is made out of is fairly thick as well. So if you hope to wear it under clothing it will not be unnoticeable. And more of an issue for me is that it doesn't seem to do anything for me. It makes no difference in my back pain.

"My experience with anything OtterBox has been great and this is no exception. That said I don't tend to use phone cases, mostly because of the bulk. I never understood buying a thinner and easier carry to phone and then putting a huge case on it. And that is why I like the Symmetry series. It adds very little bulk at all and I barely notice it when it comes to pocketing my phone. But it does add some piece of mind for minor bumps or drops. With the S6 he back side of the case bring it about even with the camera, meaning you can now law you phone flat without the camera causing it to kickstand. It also give better purchase in your hand than the factory phone which I like. There is no screen protector, which is something to note.

"This pants are good considering the price. The waist has elastic in it allowing it to fit a bit better if you are slighter larger/smaller. That said for the 34 inch waist I found the legs to feel a bit to tight in the thighs, it isn't terrible but I would prefer a little more space. The waist and length for mine (34x34) was accurate. I often find that inseams tend to run short on dress pants but these were spot on. The material is thin, but has held up find so far.

If you are okay without a bunch of extra buttons on your mouse, this may be for you. The mouse is textured with several rubbery type coatings. The buttons and mouse wheel all have firm tactile feel and feedback to them. The cord is think and braided and didn't want to lose the winded shape from package it had. It has three different DPI profile options and the tracking is spot on (310 gaming grade IR-LED optical sensor), from shooters to strategy games. The software is encompassing, maybe too much so for most people (me included). The only down side is the price is a bit high for the amount of customization on this mouse if you are serious about setting up your equipment just to your liking. For me it isn't an issue, I am no where near a pro gamer, but it is something to be aware of when you are dropping your cash.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R65K9I1QTC5UV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJZ59Y0#wasThisHelpful","R65K9I1QTC5UV","A2GVVAO242EK1D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GVVAO242EK1D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I picked this up at the same time as the Dell USB 3.0 Dual Display Universal Dock for the same purpose. Running multiple monitors on my Alienware Alpha console which I use as a desktop. And I much prefer the TRENDnet. The set up was much easier. While I had to go digging through forums for the Dell, the TRENDnet was almost just plug and play. I ran an HDMI cable to one monitor and a DVI converted to HDMI to the other and had no issues with set up and getting this rolling (Running Windows 8.1). The lack of sound from the converted DVI was a not issue since I run external speaks powered by the USB. Which brings up another thing I love about the TREND, the thing is almost covered in USBs, 2 USB3 ports and 4 USB2 ports. I was able to drop my 3 USB port dongle since everything I have (keyboard/mouse/speakers/Xbox remote) have their own ports now.The only downside for me and my use, which is not typical since I am not docking a laptop, is that the TREND is a much high profile piece of equipment compared to the DELL. The ease of use for me more than make up for that. And I guess if you are running multiple monitors it is not much of an issue.As with all docking stations if used with a laptop though you may suffer lag and poor video performance in certain apps and most games so keep that in mind. I only play fair low graphic/video demanding games on mine like Pillar of Eternity, Shadowrun, etc and have had no issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29Q2T96XI9OXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L49XDK0#wasThisHelpful","R29Q2T96XI9OXT","A2GVVAO242EK1D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GVVAO242EK1D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am rather happy with this dock, but it gave me some headaches to get it to do what I wanted. I used it with an AlienWare Alpha Console and not a laptop. That said the outputs on the Alpha are very similar to that of a laptop, since it was made to run on just one TV. I used to dock to be able to run dual monitors, which is something I couldn't do on my console without setting up daisy chaining of some sort. This way I was able to connect directly to two separate monitors using the HDMI ports. But after that I had to do some digging, since the dock itself doesn't make the monitors work. I had to use a forum to figure out how to set up my monitors using native windows applications in Windows 8. Not the most user friendly thing to do and the cause of some frustration. Once done though it was worked wonderfully. I don't play any top end shooters or the like so I haven't noticed any frame rate issues or lap in the monitors. I have read reviews saying that is an issue if you use MST/daisy chained monitors, so something to be aware of. I am rather happy. I am not super IT savvy but was able to get everything figure out that to google. But it certainly wasn't plug and play for my application","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5T53HRWL1QS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DT6LIA#wasThisHelpful","R5T53HRWL1QS9","A2GVVAO242EK1D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GVVAO242EK1D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the harder reviews for me, since there are so many variables to it. Granted I have a black thumb when it comes to plant life, not a green one. So any help is wonderful. I also live in Hawaii, a place full of green, but also fairly hot during the summer months since it is near the equator. I hate to report I had no more luck growing a lawn with this product as I did with the generic grass seed from the local box store. That said it did make a valiant effort and even sprouted in places, due to it's heat tolerance I would guess/hope. But it was not to be. Does that make this a good or bad product? It is very hard for me to honestly answer. I am going to try again without the false confidence that the 'heat tolerant, water absorbing' label gives and report back.

"I thought KT Tape was just another gimmick. But after seeing some very high profile Crossfitters and firearm instructors making use of it I though 'why not give it a tray?'. And I am glad I did. This stuff is amazing. As I've gotten older my workouts seem to take more of a toll on me, I am sore and stiff longer than I use to be and it impacts my following workouts, It is hard to get a really good bike ride in if your shoulders are still screaming from the workout the day before, or you calves and quads are singing from the previous day's beach run. I've been applying the KT Tape and it has significantly improved my recovery time. Is it witchcraft? Magic? All in my head? Maybe, but it is working for me. I initially tried it on just one shoulder when both were equally sore to see if I could tell the difference, and the next day the taped should felt much fresh, loser and less sore. Again maybe it is all mental, but still worth it to me. One recommendation I'd make is to watch the youtube videos on how to apply it correctly, it makes a world of difference. I am also fond of this big roll since I can just cut it to the length I need for whatever I happen to be taping. That saves me from using/wasting more than what I need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HU77GYHY1QJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006O67XCW#wasThisHelpful","R1HU77GYHY1QJF","A2GVVAO242EK1D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GVVAO242EK1D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seems to be a good flea and tick treatment. I used it on my smaller dog, all of 15 pounds of him, and he is flea and tick free. Which isn't always easy, living in Hawaii we have the little monsters year round. So it works well.My only grip is the price seems high and it doesn't work any better or worse than my standard Advantix (in my experience and with my sample size of two dogs and a cat). Two months of my other brand costs about $10 less than a single treatment of Bio Spot Active. I also didn't see the need for the applicator. It made it handier to put on, but seemed like a waste of packaging and effort to me. I'd have rather just gotten the treatment itself and put it on by hand.That said everyone has their preference and some treatments seems to work better in different location and for different dogs. As for myself I don't see me using this particular brand again, but if I did I do trust that it works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XJC1G0ZUQBL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6MTG9O#wasThisHelpful","R2XJC1G0ZUQBL2","A2GVVAO242EK1D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GVVAO242EK1D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having a jack on your boat, horse trailer or other light trailer is a great idea. It means you don't have to carry something extra in your truck and means you will have it with you when you need it. They did a good job at including everything you will need, though the jack's size means lighter trailers and RVs/campers only. The box has a latch for a lock, but would not keep a motivated thief out. It is also open on the end, meaning weather, road salt and the like is going to get into and on the tools. So it is not just a mount and forget, you will need to take them tools out to clean them every so often. Or otherwise weather proof the items. I've considered a weatherproofed bag along with a light coating of oil, but we will see if that works. My experience has been that horse and motorcycle trailer tires are magnets for nails, so this is worth it to me. But at the $100 price tag everyone will have to consider the cost for piece of mind and usefulness. It is cheaper and easier than getting a flat in the middle of nowhere though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZ4ZG7ZXTD7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBN1C78#wasThisHelpful","R2YZ4ZG7ZXTD7A","A2GVVAO242EK1D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GVVAO242EK1D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OtterBox pretty much owns the heavy duty phone protector case market and this one is no exception. It fits very well onto the phone and is one heck of a beefy case. The buttons are all accessible through the case and tactile. The case allowed me to use my think screen protector without issue or tearing up the edges. That might vary depending on your brand. The case is dense and while I've not tested it to destruction it has survived several table top drops with no issue. The only downside, which to be fair isn't the cases fault, is the size. The case increases the size of the phone all around included a slight edge on the screen's side.

"These may be the most comfortable full sized headphones I've ever used. There is no adjustment you need to make, the inner headband adjusts automatically. It is held in place with elastic cord which isn't so strong as to cause pressure, but enough to keep it in place. I wonder if this is going to wear out eventually, but if it does it is an easy enough fix to replace it.The cable/cord is long. The sound is also great. As another reviewer noted though, it kills the battery life on the PS4 controller. If you are playing casually its not a big deal. But if you want to spend a couple hours on CoD or Destiny then you are going to have to switch out controllers.As I mentioned the sound is good, and for the $100 price tag it should be. The microphone is good and doesn't cause feedback issues. The mute button is a sliding switch and easy to use and more so easy to know if it is muted or not based on position. Even better the mic tucks out of the way when not in use. Which is good because these headphone are good for other headphone stuff like listening to music. Even better it comes with a cable extension, so you have plenty of space when gaming and no need to deal with tons of extra cable if listening to music on your phone.Honestly if it weren't for the battery life issues these would be five stars to me.

"Use these for my three year old German Shepherd and she loves them. She thinks they are a treat and I don't need to 'convince' her to take one. She is heartworm free on her regular vet visits.

"I bought this to replace a wooden flag staff that just could not handle the wind in Hawaii. After it (the old one) broke for the third time I new it was time to move on. And what is stronger than hard wood? Steel of course, and that is what I went in search for. Turns out steel is heavy but expensive, and this flag pole had gotten good reviews. So I thought I'd give it a go. And it is well made and sturdy, I'm not sure quite what mix of metals it is made out of, but it holds up very well so far. No breaking, no bending. Just stands up tall and proud hold my heavy, all cotton, old school flags. Attachment method is simple, though you will need some type of slider/mount for the bottom of the flag. Very happy and wish I'd gotten this the first time and saved the cash I spend on the wooden one.

"It cuts and doesn't pinch or poke too much. But while it is fairly gently on the skin, it also doesn't work that great. I've used it both wet and dry and it takes many passes to get all the hair in a spot, and even then its not at all the smoothest of shaves.Now that might not be all bad. As a swimmer I used to shave pretty much all my body hair, but I didn't want to shave is razor smooth. So for something like that this would be great. But I am going out on a limb and guess most people want this to make shaving their various spots to be a faster, easier and painless process.

"This is a tough review. And that is because this thing is super expensive, far too expensive I think for what it is and does. I wanted to say that first as to get it out of the way so as not to keep bring it up during the review.Now if you don't consider the price the fan itself is amazing. It is small, takes up little room, moves vertically and horizontally, has no blades, is far more quiet than a bladed fan, has a very well thought out remote and just looks amazing. It is very futuristic looking in to my eye, like a fan you'd find on a SciFi space ship. So it doesn't look tacky or out of place in a well furnished office. The fan itself works well giving you the option of a wide or narrow path of air. And as a fan I think it is amazing.What I find less amazing though is the heating option. It just doesn't really do much. It does heat air and gently blows is, but the farther way you are the less warm air reaches you. It feels like someone holding a hair dryer across the room from you and gently fanning it back and forth. Pleasant to be sure, but probably pointless. Not that it bothers me much since this is going to probably live its life as a replacement for a standard fan in my office. Maybe I'll find a use for the heating option I've not discovered yet. But as a fan, this thing is awesome.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NRW78HDP36U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMLKEUK#wasThisHelpful","R2NRW78HDP36U","A2GVVAO242EK1D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GVVAO242EK1D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great bench, if you use it for what it is made, which is a general workout bench. If you are throwing up 250 pound benches this isn't ideal and its not really made for that, and thus not as sturdy as needed. But for lighter workouts with free weights and any body weight exercises and the like it is great. It is sturdy and darn heavy, though the mounting system would worry me if you really started to stack weight. It goes together with twelves bolts and two pass through nuts with bolts at the end. It is super easy to assemble and doesn't feel cheap or wobbly. It has a good footprint and so doesn't tip or move around. The bench itself is firm, but not hard. For my garage gym where I use body weight and kettle bells for my weight it is perfect. It isn't a weight bench though and won't replace one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VXESHA8KK5W8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W1BN8GO#wasThisHelpful","R3VXESHA8KK5W8","A2GVVAO242EK1D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GVVAO242EK1D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Living in Hawaii, ran is a constant. I've found wipers that work just as well as the Bosch brand, but none of them are as durable or last as long. If the price is close at all, I go with Bosch. It is very easy to install, works well, lasts a long time, and wears gradually. Meaning you have a fair amount of warning when it needs replacing. That last bit really sets is apart from the less quality option that seems to go from working to trashed in an instant.

"I live in Hawaii and the beach along with snorkeling is practically a state past time. So I get a good deal of use out of this. You can spend a lot more on equipment, but most people don't need to. This kit comes with a good pair of adjustable fins, which can be worn with barefeet or swim shoes without much trouble. The goggles are good, fit and seal well and have good clear lenses. The snorkel, the second most important part of your gear, is well made. It has a splash guard and blow valve. Both of which make snorkeling a lot more fun and a lot easier when introducing new people to it.My only real complaint, if you can call it that, is that the snorkel valve will eventually wear out with use and allow water to seep in. In this price range I rather expect that. And it can be delayed for a good deal of time as long as you take proper care of your gear and don't just throw it back in the bag and leave it to dry out. The goggle lenses also benefit from a good cleaning with toothpaste or similar to remove the silicon on the inside. That will help with fogging. Then if you smear a little bit of baby shampoo on the inside of the lens you can essentially go snorkeling and be worry free when it comes to fogging.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C7JQFVYXNJOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLE3GMA#wasThisHelpful","R1C7JQFVYXNJOA","A2GVVAO242EK1D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GVVAO242EK1D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fairly standard chair. Not bad, but not great either. The back and seat are very firm with a very level seat. Assembly was super easy taking all of maybe ten minutes. That said the back attaches to the chair with four bolts and through the arm rests. And the arm rests attach to the base/seat with four more bolts. It doesn't seem like a design that would hold up to a lot of use/wear. Though since I've only had it a few weeks there is no way to know that yet. It feels sturdy enough at this point and with five legs is very grounded as well. So for an inexpensive office chair I think it will serve just fine. As to its potential life span, that remains to be seen and I will update my review when I have more time on the seat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13A37F2J51KEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVKEZO8#wasThisHelpful","R13A37F2J51KEB","A2GVVAO242EK1D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GVVAO242EK1D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't really sure what to expect from this. I have an older mattress, that was fairly expensive when I bought it, but it has seen better days. And this top has really revitalized it. The foam is great, and really makes a difference despite its short height compared to the mattress. Memory foam turns out to be pretty awesome stuff. It firms up my bed, and gives a good deal of support despite being very 'squishy' to the touch.It ships rolled up in a much smaller box than one would expect. Though it is heavy. It also comes with a sheet/covering that the foam actually goes into and then attaches to the bed like a normal sheet. The only downside is that it does increase the height of my bed several inches. It also needs a day or so after you unpack it to 'grow' into its full size. All that is more than offset but the good night sleeps I've been able to get since using it. And at a much cheaper price than a new mattress.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKEAK13Z3GYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y4BGT06#wasThisHelpful","R1YKEAK13Z3GYK","A2GVVAO242EK1D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GVVAO242EK1D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was in the mood for some urban fantasy and thought I'd take a chance on this based on reviews on Amazon. And I am glad I did. Its not a ground breaking book and some some cliche's to it, but it works very well and is a page turner. The author starts out with something unique, which is he gives us a competent female lead. In too many books with female leads they characters tend to start naive and make bad choices, the main character here, Amber, is competent and collected. She deals with some wild changes but doesn't seem to make too man off the wall choices.The world building is also well done, familiar enough to think you know it, but with enough uniqueness to make it interesting. A number of super natural beings are introduces, some of which would be considered 'traditional' but without a huge amount of explanation. Instead of being annoying this leaves you wanting more and looking forward to more detail in the following books. The pace seems good though I do feel the end was slightly rushed, but not badly. The ending also clearly leads into a new books, which since this is listed as 'book 1' is to be expected. But I would have like a little but of closure as I wait for the following book.If I were to complain it would that the author uses Amber's military background too much. I wish he would have chosen a more realistic military background for her and then used it a little more sparingly. I like the weapon depictions in the book, which are mostly accurate. While wildly not practical I liked seeing the HK MK23 used in a book like this. All and all I was happy with it and look forward to the next book. I hope it gets better, second books can usually go either way. But I look forward to seeing more of this world and it's characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12FWD0OATLK4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RJXPQM#wasThisHelpful","R12FWD0OATLK4J","A2GVVAO242EK1D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GVVAO242EK1D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mine arrived without instructions and with all the shelves and struts bent. It looked like someone had parked a truck on the box and just flattened everything as much as possible. The missing instructions isn't that bad, its not a hard thing to figure out how to assemble it. But since it had been squashed, none of the holes lined up. Worse every shelf had to be bent to assemble, as did the struts. This means assembly took a long time and required extra tools.But I strove on and at the end of it I had a crooked, bent, ugly, shelf system that I wouldn't trust to stand up under its own weight let alone 700 pounds of tools. This isn't the type of item I give a second chance, if its this bad there is no way I trust another to be better. Save your money, or just throw you money away instead of buying it.

"Everyone should wash their hair. Not everyone conditions, it would be great if they made a product that does both. And apparently they do. I don't usually use a conditioner and I'll be honest and say I can't really notice a difference between this and just using shampoo. I have short hair and its fairly thin, so maybe its just me. The bottle is large and well priced (shipping isn't depending on how you order it). It lasts a good deal of time for me which is nice.Ultimately I only want something that works, I don't really care about much else.

"I like most men and Americans spend a good deal of time on the toilet, its where I get most of my reading done. I also lived in Japan for several years and they have elevated the toilet to a new form, USB, heat, cooling, music, wifi, just amazing stuff. This seat isn't nearly that fancy, but its not meant to be.My downstairs bathroom is in a very small room with no ventalation for some reason. And its right at the entrace to the house, so avoiding any stink for both the sake of our family and possible embarressment of our guests made this worth a try.Install is super easy, though removal of your old seat depends on the level of rust that might have built up around your old bolts. The mounting hardware is all included and easy. The seat mounts to a bracket which replaces your old connection. There is a spring loaded catch that allows quick and easy removal of the seat. I was worried about the firmness of the seat since the mounting bracket is small and plastic, but so far no issues.The filter seems to work fairly well and the fan is not at all loud. The little smell dispenser seems gimmicky and seemed somewhat over powered to me. Maybe the filter is working better than expected and thus the scents are just easier to pick up. The seat runs on two DD batteries which I have no idea how long they will last. But I'd imagine you get a good deal of life out of them. In fact the DD seems a bit overkill for the small fan but I'm not electronic engineer. The fan/battery compartment doesn't really add too much bulk or look out of place.All and all I am somewhat impressed with the seat, which is something I didn't ever think I'd type in a review or even think. Is this a must buy? Well considering the bathroom placement I used it in, it was for me.

"I am by now means and IT like person. Asking the Oracle (google) I can get through most of my tech issues. That said this was by far the easiest router I've ever set up in my life.

It does come with a install disc but I have no computer with a CD drive to try it on.I live in a house full of wireless devices, tablets for streaming and multiple consoles for gaming. There was a noticeable difference in speed when switching to this new router (a good one). The Wizard that Linksys uses is very intuitive. It allows you to really dig into the systems, bands, devices, block list, duplicate MACs, etc with a super easy interface. You can set passwords for all three networks. The guest network on this devices works easier than my last Netgear was, and can of course be turned on or off without issue.Connecting my wired printer and my 4TB storage device to the modem was just plug and play. I've not had any issues with the network dropping and my speed has almost doubled on some devices. It is also much easier to prioritize data on this router than my last couple, thus making Vonage/Skype much easier to use.

"I've been using this with my two year old daughter and this is my third time potty training a child. The first two were tried and trued old school methods and both kids were completely different in what worked and didn't.My youngest is partially potty trained now, and usually goes to the bathroom during the day when she is up. I know from experience that is much harder for them to know at night when they need to go. So my hope was this would give her a little bit of a helping hand. And only being a month into it I'd say it is effective, though I don't know if its the new best thing. It does let her know its time to go and she will usually get to the toilet, but not always. She also moves sometimes and dislodges the cable. The attachment method seems to be pretty good and I don't see a work around to the issue. If your child tosses and turns then I don't think this would be the best option. I wish they would make a blutooth model. I can also see an issue with the device for kids who just won't accept something being attached to them at bed time.All that said I think its effective and I think it will speed up the hardest part of potty training for my daughter.

"I am a huge fan of blutooth headphones, but have killed the batteries on them too many times during weekend game sessions. So I went looking for something with good sound quality but plug in instead of wireless. That search let me to these and I am quite happy with them. The sound quality is very good, probably the best quality headphones I've used that aren't sound cancelling. With the PS specific apps I've found the sound quality to be better if you are willing to play with it a little. But the reality is I was quite happy with a plug and play. The 7.1 is a big selling point though and it works well. While no 'supported' as well for a PC there are apps/drivers you can download to make them work. So I've also used these on my PC and my Alien Alpha console with Windows 8.1. Set up wasn't difficult at all, though to be fair I just went online instead of bothering with the included instructions.My only complaint would be price, at $39 I'd give it five stars.

"I've had a hard time comping up with an actual review for this item, since its so different. But it seems perfectly made to my tastes. I consider myself a gamer, but I stopped playing computer games many years ago and focused on consoles. In part because I never needed to update drivers or hardware on a console. But there are many games I've missed out on over the years because of it. Now I can play them, and not only that but on my TV just like my consoles.The Alpha is some form of computer/consoles synthesis. Its not a console that plays computer games, but more of a computer set up to act like a console. It comes with Windows 8 for example and will do most anything a desk top would be asked for. But you never even need use the computer mode. In fact when you start up initially only console mode is available. But it gives you access to the vast number of games on the Steam site (around 3700) last I checked. And while its expensive compared to a PS4/XBOXONE the games are generally much better priced, down to just a couple dollars each for some games.Because it allows you to play computer games it also benefits from a keyboard and mouse. Some of the games on Steam only work with that combo and no the console, so its a good addition. Besides that if you don't have accounts already you will do a lot of set up that is much easier with a keyboard. Graphics are great and to my untrained eye seems every bit as good and often better than my new gen consoles. I've had no connection issues or streaming problems at this point which was one of my fears. Games download fast and I've had no issues with freezes or lock up yet either. It is also whisper quiet which is nice compared to PCs I've used in the past.As of this review there are still apps missing. For example I can't currently stream music or video, connect to Netflix in app mode or the like. But I hope those things are in the works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ITE5MQYI24NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MA7AFDI#wasThisHelpful","R1ITE5MQYI24NP","A2GVVAO242EK1D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GVVAO242EK1D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While the series was obviously campy and a little goofy it had good characters and decent action that it kept you entertained throughout its sadly one and only season.Think a little less budgeted 90's Batman movie super hero for t.v. and you'll have the Flash. The episodes were a mix of funny,over the top,and ultimately enjoyable as you saw the Flash take down both regular criminals and his more iconic though wacky multiple nemesis in the series and kudos to Mark Hamill for his portrayal of the trickster though most nowadays will familiarize his laughter with his more iconic role as the Joker.  The video and audio have been done well in the set with not graininess or distortions to complain about though again the dress style will obviously confuse the current generation many who grew up during this time will most likely have feelings of a nostalgia.So for fans of the Smallville,Arrow and the current Flash series this is good addition to check out and for the price a great deal too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TS05LOH4SDRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EXWGJW#wasThisHelpful","R1TS05LOH4SDRX","AFV2584U13XP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFV2584U13XP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set brings the finale to a very entertaining series and while you have the sets from a few years ago Viz Media did a fantastic job restoring the video and audio quality of the series to be a vastly superior ones to the ones from a few years ago. I can tell you that you will definitely see and hear better quality from these new sets then the ones from before as you won't have the lines on the top and bottom when the picture changes scenes and no glitchy scratchy sounds coming form time to time when the characters talk. While you obviously aren't given a finale from the series  it still gives a good conclusion to the anime series that fits it nicely.For those possibly concerned no worries as Viz hasn't done any re-dubbing so the original English cast are still heard voicing their character roles and of course you have the talented Japanese voice cast for the sub as well. So fans of the series I say these new sets are definitely worth looking into and for new fans of the series or just anime fans looking for an entertaining anime these sets are well worth taking a look at to add to your anime dvd collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R385XIPS5P7A88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLB85AM#wasThisHelpful","R385XIPS5P7A88","AFV2584U13XP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFV2584U13XP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The series still continues to give excitement and entertainment for most of the season and I'm glad to see that there will be a couple of more seasons of this enjoyable series to watch. The season gives us a ice mingle of drama as Sam tries to reclaim his beloved brother Dean from the fate that befell him at the end of the last season though it's going to be a strong battle of wills going against Dean as now he can openly indulge his darker desires without no regrets. The season episodes were 95% entertaining to watch with the exception of about two that were a little lackluster but still entertaining Regardless fans rejoice as now the 10th season is upon us to enjoy and savior to our hearts content.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1960011D8GEQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5D4PTU#wasThisHelpful","R1960011D8GEQZ","AFV2584U13XP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFV2584U13XP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like with the previous fours seasons the fifth starts out wit ha bang as well as introducing Five-0's newest member as a series regular.You'll have a decent mix of action/drama/romance and thrills from the writers and while there are about five episodes that are lackluster the rest do a good job of keeping you entertained throughout the end of the episode. For the price it was a great deal to add this season to the other four I already have which is somewhat surprising as I wasn't much of a fan the first season but the series did grow on me.

"The game shows the power of the Gen8 console with the vast free exploration so far of the game world and the graphics/sound quality from the lightning storms to the background shouting of bandits trying to catch up to you and do some bad things you don't want to know.  The combat does feel more then a little similar to two other games I've played Batman:Arkham series and Shadow Of Mordor from the counters to the various take downs. Of course you'll have the usual upgrade ability tree for Max and his car and also again like with SOM the health bad doesn't regenerate with time but pretty much with what amounts to health packs which is both appreciated and sometimes annoying depending on the situation. Also like with TR:DE you have to collect and  use scrap and certain other materials to upgrade your equipment which means a lot of time you're going to be searching the wastelands for as mush scrap as possible to boost up your car and such.I've been having a great time with the game so far and if you like the previous mentioned games you're sure to enjoy this game as well.Update 09-17-15After playing the game for awhile I'm still enjoying it but sadly a few glitches have toned down some of the enjoyment. First is the option screen when you have to either upgrade your car,skills and the like the menu will switch back and forth sometimes without you pushing a button or moving the controller stick which in turn makes you have to go back to the screen you were previously at and sometimes redo your actions like if you were doing an upgrade and such. Another problem is during the gameplay when you're walking around Max will sometimes spontaneously jump or roll without you using the button to do that action luckily though this doesn't happen as far as I've experienced when you're in a fight. Hopefully they'll release a patch soon to fix these problems as somewhat minute they are still annoying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MYANTIR3ACEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DFT0WVU#wasThisHelpful","R1MYANTIR3ACEN","AFV2584U13XP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFV2584U13XP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the SW:Clone Wars series was an action filled and entertaining series showing us the adventures of Obi-wan,Anakin and his padawan apprentice Asohka during their time in the clone wars this feels more reminiscent of what made us fans of the Star Wars universe as it starts off during the early years before Episode 4. The characters are all entertaining as you have Kanan Jarrus a former jedi knight now living as a smuggler along with his comrades/family Hera Syndulla a strong willed female twi'lek who is the talented pilot of the groups ship The Ghost as well as the moral compass and the rugged lasat former honor guard Zeb Orrelios who is the muscle of the group and the last two being Sabine Wren a a young female mandalorian who at one time was being trained at the imperial military academy before realizing what the empire was really about and finally Ezra Bridger a young kind-hearted thief who finds out his strong connection to the force when meeting the group and starts training under Kanan to learn the ways of the force and become a jedi.The CGI animation is pretty much the same as with the SW:Clone wars series so if you weren't a fan of that animation you won't really care for this series animation either. Of course the group will get into trouble as well as running into dark force users along the way and trying to figure out their ultimate plan and what they want to do against the empire and how to do it.  The voice cast was picked very well and kudos to James Earl Jones for re voicing his iconic performance as Darth Vader in the second season first episode which makes us fans excited that the second season is close upon us. So if you already have the collection of the Clone wars series then this one is obviously a must have and now the only thing to do is wait for the start of the second season for us to enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32DS6BVM4SKDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3NV64#wasThisHelpful","R32DS6BVM4SKDL","AFV2584U13XP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFV2584U13XP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking for a good quality game sound bar without having to pay an arm and a leg is frustrating as you're trying to find a good deal and also a good sound bar but after much searching this one turned out to be a good choice. The set up is pretty easy just connect the red/white audio cables into your t.v.(sadly no optical connection with this sound bar) plug it into a power socket and you're done. Like with most sound bars you have a mini remote that gives you the multiple sound feature options like movie/music/games audio settings and a good bass support.I can't say how this equals to some of the other ones at the same price(RCA/Vizio,etc) but after trying a few games out the sound was amazing as you get more sound audio and bass when playing even some sounds you didn't hear with some of the good quality headsets you might use when gaming. Case in point I tried out Tomb Raider:Definitive Edition with the sound bar and was stunned at hearing some of the new noises I didn't and couldn't hear when playing while using my headset or the speakers on my t.v. like birds chirping in the background and the like. The built in subwoofer works as stated giving deep bass when you're playing combat/action games. There is no wall bar to support the sound bar only two screws to put into your entertainment stand(which I did) if you wish or through the wall(which I can't since I'm renting an apartment) but it's lightweight so the two screws are all you really need to support it.So if you're a gamer who is looking for an affordable sound bar without having to pay too much for one this is a pretty good choice for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZI3L794RC1VJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANJRWTA#wasThisHelpful","R1ZI3L794RC1VJ","AFV2584U13XP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFV2584U13XP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While you don't expect a deep serious in-depth story it's not a memorable one either just more a watch and forget but hardly a horrible or good movie to have. The CGI effects were good and the action was decent but nothing really kept you in your seat to watch the movie all the way through as opposed to getting snacks and checking your email from time to time. The actors and actresses were also pretty good so there really isn't any fault for them on this bland movie just that the movie turned out to be a bland vampire action movie. For $5 the dvd is worth adding to your collection but if you don't feel like getting it you're not really missing out on much either check a few clips if possible online to make your choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XLXJSY3V7F6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIHYU#wasThisHelpful","R2XLXJSY3V7F6A","AFV2584U13XP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFV2584U13XP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While the material and quality of the protective skin is decent it has a few major flaws that at the end really don't make this an ideal thing to have. First is that the resistance you get with the controller sticks as you get more resistance when you move them around which is annoying to say the least. When you move the controller sticks around the rubberized skin actually pushes back against the motion and thus you have to use a little more force then usual when making the movement not much but still it's a little annoying.If you don't mind having that resistance when you use the controller then this is an alright product for you but if you find it annoying to use more force on your controller sticks like I did then pass this over.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TCVN5S5JI9DP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHUSNPU#wasThisHelpful","R2TCVN5S5JI9DP","AFV2584U13XP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFV2584U13XP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you like the Clamp manga anime franchise series like Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE,X/Clamp 1999 and the like you'll find this series to be very enjoyable but the plot to be a mix of alright to bland. It takes some parts of the series Blood+ but not too much of it and intermixes it with this series of a young tormented female vampire trying to find her way with both her cursed life and the life she wants but unknown to her she's just a piece in a game that seeks to use her for some at this time unknown and nefarious plot. The animation and soundtrack are very reminiscent of the series Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE and XXX/Holic so if you didn't care for that kind of animation then sadly this is one series you won't want to get.  There are also some pretty gory and bloody scenes especially at the end so obviously not meant for the younger audiences either but if you're a fan of the series Hellsing and the like then you'll get a kick out of this series too.  The voice cast for the English dub and Japanese subbed did a terrific job voicing their character roles and Funimation give us a decent combo pack again with the standard dvd's and blu-rays. So if you into vampire or the darker undertone animes this is a pretty decent one to check out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WEBLY8VGCH6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009T3AHPC#wasThisHelpful","R2WEBLY8VGCH6D","AFV2584U13XP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFV2584U13XP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I am having fun with DA:Inquisition and also feels a little bit stifling in some of its gameplay control mechanics where as this one feels more like it's given the gamer more freedom with controlling the actions and abilities of the game character. Many have compared this with the Dark souls games and after playing DS2 I also feel a sense of deja vu but not in a bad way as both have a somewhat different take on certain points in their individual games. The graphics look great though I still feel they could have just as easily released the game on the PS3/Xbox 360 with no problems either. One point that should be made that a few naysayers have complained about is the difficulty of certain bosses and creatures,you can grind your character up with abilities and equipment and that's somewhat the point as you can't just expect a level 3 fighter to take on a dragon lord and expect to win right off the bat. So explore and level up but don't feel rushed to try and finish the game so take your time.If you liked Skyrim,Darksiders 2,DA then you're sure to have fun with this game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6UZDIKVGPEX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IB7ON3E#wasThisHelpful","R6UZDIKVGPEX2","AFV2584U13XP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFV2584U13XP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Obviously this is more meant for fans of the Captain Harlock franchise though while I haven't watched any of them for awhile I was entertained nonetheless.

"While the graphics,effects,sound and character design look great the single player mode felt a little short overall and the story while interesting felt like a standard t.v. drama episode but overall still entertaining. If you played any of the previous BF games then no worries as the overall controls are still the same except the stealth take downs where instead of killing your enemies you'll usually do a arrest take down or knock them out.  Also you'll have a spot here and these with what almost feels like Splinter Cell levels to a small point thought not much of it.  Since I don't play online really anymore I can't tell you any qualities on that aspect of the game sorry to say but a friend has said he's been having fun so at most the standard usual online gameplay.  Since here's really no major difference in price between the PS4/XBO version and the PS3/Xbox 360 one I'd say go with the Gen8 version if you have a PS4/XBO more for the graphics as opposed to gameplay quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RRNPL7PWCATK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KME8K9C#wasThisHelpful","R1RRNPL7PWCATK","AFV2584U13XP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFV2584U13XP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The second season of Aquarion was an alright one and had a decent finale but not one you might feel like watching again anytime soon as the characters and story were somewhat bland and standard generic overall. The story tries to get you into what is happening to the characters and tries to be dramatic but you can't help but think how the plot has been soo over played in other animes with better quality in them. The characters while somewhat entertaining are hardly original and barely endear themselves to you and the situations they go through so most times you really don't care what happens to them which in itself is tragic. The animation and soundtrack for the series are done well and a funny is while you would think they would have the standard fan service there's really hardly any here and the parts that are shown are pretty toned down. Appreciated though once again is that Funimation has released the two part set of the series with both standard dvd's and blu-ray dvd's though the extras are pretty bare bone just the usual trailers and a commentary.If you can get the both parts of the series for $50 or under it's a good deal but any more and you should check out a few episodes online if possible to see if you're willing to pay the amount for the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FZII685Q8HUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00II5BIZK#wasThisHelpful","R1FZII685Q8HUJ","AFV2584U13XP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFV2584U13XP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I liked that this book talked about how we can each find our own charismatic personality. There are great examples of how to create, enhance and learn charisma. Then the author explains what can be combined with your charisma. Some examples are God, being able to choose your own destiny, and of course how it relates to your heart and love. These examples made me think a lot about how I am myself, and I have everything I need to be successful. The author then describes ways you can use your charisma and uniqueness to improve your future. Your job included. This is definitely a great book for anyone that wants to improve their interactions with others! I am giving this book a 4/5.

The historical facts in this book reminded me of all the greats of the past. I would love to be able to meet Jesse James. Jesse James is just one of the many historical figures in this book. The love was there, however it was a sub plot. The best part of this book however is the fantasy aspect. Time travel at it's best. Meeting famous people from the past, changing the future, and Eden really made for a great story. The author has a great style of writing and I was kept hooked until the end. What I also liked was that there was a warning at the beginning that had my mind going, even before I started reading.

"This is definitely an epic fantasy novel. Not only was I transported to another place. I also felt like I could not leave until things were set right. This is only book one, and it has a lot to take in and learn about. There were sentences that seemed a little too wordy for me. I felt as though the author took everday words and used a thesaurus to make his sentences. I found myself stopping to understand the context of the writing, and I even had to look some words up. This would not normally bother me, however the author also had special names for the realm he created and the things in it. There was a map and two glossaries. I am giving this book a 3/5.

"At this price point I expect a lot and came away with a good impression; however, there are a few kinks to be worked out before I'd give this 5 stars.To make this short and sweet, I'll just list the good points first:*  Perfect finish without a flaw anywhere. No blemishes in the finish, the lens area was not only tight but perfectly clean and there were no rough edges anywhere.*  This sucker has heft.  With batteries installed I'd guess this puppy weighs a good couple pounds.  You won't notice it underwater but on ground this could double as a secondary personal defense weapon.*  Perfect magnetic switch with no audible clicks, just a smooth push operation.  This torch comes with 3 brightness settings and a slight push of the switch will cycle you right through them.*  Top brightness is blinding on land and lit up my 1,600 square foot home brighter than turning on the lamps. On high power it's so bright that people will turn away.  The lowest level is what you'd expect from a high end standard flashlight.  Yep, it's that bright.Now on the the not-so-great points and why I dinged it a star:*  Should be a fluorescent color, not black.  Impossible to see in dark water or in any absence of light.*  O rings at the battery insertion point bunch up when screwing the head back on.  It got so bad and frustrating I removed the top O ring just to get the head to go back on.  So far the other 2 have kept water from going in but that was at a depth of 10 feet -- who knows what'll happen at deeper levels.*  Instructions?  What instructions?  Guess they assume you'll figure it out.  Obviously made in China since they only note was attached to the lanyard cord and it stated (in cryptic English) not to put this on sand or cast iron.*  Batteries as some generic brand and, in fact, they are completely unbranded as to markings.  Ditto for the charger.Overall, this is a very bright and competent underwater light if you can get past the lack of instructions and frustrating O ring system.  These latter two items need to be worked on, especially given this price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OEH023SO771X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQ4KCUG#wasThisHelpful","R2OEH023SO771X","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me state this is great soap; however, I find the use of ""large"" or ""extra large"" to be somewhat misleading.  At best, this is roughly the size of a medium size bar of standard soap although this one is a rectangular block with no curved corners.Other than size, this is one dense bar of soap with a scent that is so prominent it's possible to just use this as a room freshener by just removed it from the wrapper.Lather is rich and luxurious and the scent seems to hang around on the body for an hour or so after use.  So much so, I'd definitely call this a woman's soap, as sexist as that may seem.My only major gripe is the price, which I find to be a bit much for just one bar.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H2NG05SZRNP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVNYIFW#wasThisHelpful","R2H2NG05SZRNP7","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, I’m a guy and there isn’t much to get excited about when it comes to frying pans, but I do the majority of cooking in my household and anything that’ll help in that process is welcome.If first appearances to count, this one wins the game.  The look is definitely retro and in a sea of black and gray pans, this stands out with a hard-to-ignore turquoise finish reminiscent of the 1960s.  Even the handle is color coordinated and that adds to the flair.For those who really care, just the outer area is turquoise with the pan’s center being an off-white or cream with a silver ring along the edge.  What you see in the pictures is what you get.I would call the build quality near top drawer with hardly a mark, blemish or imperfection anywhere.  The non-stick finish was flawless in this respect, a rarity in store-bought pans that often have abrasions from shipping or mass handlings.  I did find the outer surface a little rough, but I’ve been finding this on all of the aluminum pans I’ve looked at so it must be a by-product of the material and not a defect in manufacturing.As for weight, I’d have to state it’s a middle weight.  Not too heavy but not so light it becomes questionable as to longevity among the brutes I have.  It’s aluminum so I expected as much.And now on to the real test -- can this thing cook without sticking or having to use gobs of who-knows-what to keep things from sticking?For my experiment I chose dad’s favorite - eggs.  Keeping to instructions, I used a small dab of something claiming to be “near” butter and keep the heat to a medium setting.  Within a couple of minutes the yellow eyed buggers were cooked and slid out like you-know-what through a goose.  Although it’s hard to tell exactly, it did seem the pan didn’t take as long to cook those eggs as my old Teflon standby.Quite impressive.I also noticed that this pan heats up quickly, much more so than my standard non-aluminum pans.  Just about as quickly as I turned the heat on the butter was starting to melt.So, if I’m so enamored with this pan why did I ding it a star?The restrictions, mainly.For example:#  Low to medium heat only.  What if I want to cook those eggs faster?  Will it cause problems?  I did try it on the second batch of eggs and the increased heat caused the butter to pop and spatter much more than normal.  Guess high heat is a problem here.#  Hand washing is recommended over dishwashers.  On a pan this large I normally hand wash anyway, but dishwashers are not recommended.  This could be a problem for some.#  Butter or certain oils, but not extra virgin olive oil?  That means my girlfriend, who cooks her eggs in that type of oil, can’t use this pan.  Apparently these oil types lead to carbonization, a fancy term for burning and sticking.#  It doesn’t play nicely with other pans in the pantry.  It has to be shielded with paper towels or some other buffer to act as interference so other materials don’t scratch the surface.  I’m generally not that picky when it comes to setting my pans up but I guess this one goes on top of the stack.  To be fair, a lot of pans come with this warning now.Some may also see the utensil restrictions as a hindrance, but I don’t. This one comes with dire warnings about using another other than plastic, silicone or wood utensils but I’ve always used non-metal tools with my pans anyway.Not a bad pan to have in your kitchen and as long as you can live with the restrictions, a worthwhile investment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZQUMAX8B8VHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXTDF3C#wasThisHelpful","RZQUMAX8B8VHC","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If there is one thing to be said for these it's that they are the smoothest writing pens I've ever come across -- ballpoint, roller-ball and all.  I have never seen a ballpoint glide so effortlessly.  In fact, as a test I wrote on the cushioned packaging Amazon sent it in just to see if the point would pierce the outer shell (which is usually the case) and it didn't do anything but glide and leave a perfect line of ink.Bravo, Paper Mate!As for the stylus, it does the job effectively, too; however, there really isn't much to get excited about in the stylus arena.  This isn't to ding the product in that respect, but once you've seen a stylus you've pretty much seen them all.The one design flaw here is the cap -- it's removable.  This pen would have been better served with a click mechanism or a twist barrel.  Making a handwritten note while using your tablet requires you remove the top and then find a place to put it.  Yes, you could just put it on the stylus end but then you've got no stylus.  In addition, the cap makes this one long pen/stylus combo.Still, for the price you can't lose here.

"This is a tough product to review for a couple reasons.  First, it makes a claim of lasting up to 6 hours and, second, it costs substantially more than other air fresheners (although most don’t make any longevity claims).Does this product last 6 hours?I tested this by spraying it in two rooms, the first being 400 square feet and the other being 120.  Both are active bedrooms with the larger having a master bath.While the inhabitants were out for a few hours I sprayed both and left them without any disturbance.My girlfriend caught a whiff of “something” when she came back but my father couldn’t smell anything in his larger room.  Give or take, this was roughly 3 hours after I sprayed.Of course, the bottle states “Up To…” so that can be anywhere from 1 minute up to 5.99 hours, but I’d have to call this one pretty much gone after half the maximum.As for the scent, I’d call it lightly floral but not too overwhelming once the spray settles.  It’s pleasant without being in your face.Now on to the cost.  It’s high to say the least -- way too high.Unfortunately, due to the high cost and somewhat limited longevity of the scent, I’d have to list this as a purchase you might make if you’re having last minute guests that don’t plan on hanging around too long and you need to cover up last night’s liver and onions dinner.Otherwise, it’s an expensive way to add a temporary scent.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19QDTHQCH8CD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMYIU6#wasThisHelpful","R19QDTHQCH8CD4","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For the uninitiated, just a little will do the trick so even this small container will last you quite a while (as it should for the price).Also has a pleasant scent that doesn't hang around annoyingly like some other creams I've tried that seem to try impressing others by smelling up the immediate area for an extended period of time (you know who you are).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I6LEHNZ3TT8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052OUDLU#wasThisHelpful","R3I6LEHNZ3TT8M","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the window treatment arena, in my opinion, you have functional, upscale and bohemian designs.While the first two are self-explanatory and may overlap to some degree, the third entry is sort of hard to explain.  They may be functional, but the bohemian designs lack the quality and finish of the upscale offerings.This set is definitely bohemian, i.e., 1960s hippie “hey dude” chic.The pattern is nice with small flowers on a lace type design but the overall cut and finish are somewhat off-putting in comparison. While these curtains did have design, the effort was somewhat questionable.  Instead of straight lines on the sides and bottom, these come with scalloped edges with an occasional straight line here and there.  There are threads sticking out in various areas and so many of these existed I thought it might be part of design until I realized there is no rhyme or reason to their existence (they weren’t every other scallop but were obviously random). Either the machine doing the cutting didn’t have a sharp blade and left some strands or it is part of the design (I did find it odd that every, and I do mean every, one of these strands was exactly the same length).In addition, the top rod pocket isn’t exactly the most even I’ve ever seen.  It seems to go from wide to narrow in various areas and this becomes more evident as you place these on a rod (tight in some areas, loose in others).  The curtains did fit on my standard rod but the combination of loose and tight made movement on the rod difficult.As for weight, let’s just state that if they were any lighter they’d float.  No need to worry if that old rod will support these.  And what of light filtering?  Notice they are called window “treatments” which is another way of saying these aren’t curtains more than a way to cover uglier curtains already up.So, how do these hang?  Actually, they are not bad in this respect but I would recommend washing these first since they are a little stiff (probably some treatment to keep them from just wrinkling in the package).  Surprisingly, even though these were packed tightly in a plastic pouch and had been for who knows how long, there were few wrinkles or nasty creases.As these good curtains?  For $10, yes.  For over twice that amount the investment is somewhat questionable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19E18GN4Z228R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXYDXG6#wasThisHelpful","R19E18GN4Z228R","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Most times you get a frail chain along with a pendant that requires a magnifying glass to see.If I had to venture a quick guess, I’d state this is over an inch from point to point and is well finished and presented.  No rough edges and the polish is nicely done.  It hangs nicely without binding on the chain.About my only gripes involve the box and chain.

"Over the years I’ve used a wide variety of Kensington keyboards but this is first convertible unit that can operate via USB or Bluetooth.As designs go, this is best described as a full-sized unit, typical of what you might find with a desktop computer or in an office.  It has the ubiquitous numerical keypad to the right along with a complement of F1 through F12 keys above the standard keys.About the only major differences belong to the keys and overall thickness. The keys are chicklet instead of the usual raised keys you might find on a generic keyboard and the thickness is in the category of svelte (read below about the battery hump).Construction appears top notch with a black matte finish that seems to wear better than the usual glossy you find.In keeping with the market share tradition, this unit is clearly marked for Windows users with the Microsoft flag taking prominent position near the space key.  If you’re wondering, there are no secondary markings for any other OS such as OS X, Android, Chrome, etc.While this unit is ultra thin there is a prominent hump in the back for battery storage and while this may look ungainly at first it does serve secondary duty as an elevator (of sorts) that keeps the keyboard at a nice upward angle.  Even with batteries installed (2 AA, included) this is still a lightweight unit.  I did find it somewhat odd that pop-out elevators are included on the bottom.  Extending these actually made the angle a bit steep (just the battery hump is sufficient in my opinion).Connections are simple enough.  Essentially, if you want to use the USB connector you merely attach the included USB cable to the keyboard and the other end goes, you guessed it, into a USB port on your CPU.  There is a switching key on the keyboard itself and pressing this converts it from Bluetooth and battery power to USB connected and port powered.Bluetooth is the usual “press the pairing key and wait” scenario and was simple enough; however, the pairing button on the back was so small and indented I had to use a pen in order to press it.In my household we have a mixture of OS X, Android, iOS, Chrome and Windows electronics and this keyboard had no problem connecting with any of them; however, there are a few quirks:*  iOS tablets see it as a keyboard -- period.  Function keys have no function here; however, to be fair no keyboards I’ve used with iOS have function keys that work.*  Chrome OS had the worst time with this keyboard.  Chrome uses a dedicated Search key to bring up the app menu and I couldn’t find an acceptable substitute here.  No matter, I just used the mouse to access it.*  Android tablet usage exhibited the same virtues and vices as the iOS usage did.  Function keys have no function, although they did exhibit unusual behavior on occasion (such as the F4 key decreasing volume one time but never again).*  OS X was a mixed bag.  With no dedicated Apple keys, owners must know that the Windows based Alt and Del keys may have to substitute for equivalent Apple Control, Option and Command keys.  Don’t believe reports that this keyboard doesn’t work with Apple computers -- it works just fine but the notes above about the keys still apply.*  Naturally, Windows computers and tablets had no problems at all with this keyboard.  That should be a given since the keyboard is geared for those systems.*  Run out of USB ports and utilize a secondary hub?  If that hub is powered via the USB port on your computer and nothing else, it probably won’t work with this unit.  My powered hub had no problems but when I unplugged the power pack it wouldn’t work (then again, my mouse wouldn’t either).And now for the final quirk -- why in the world would anybody using a tablet consider using a full size keyboard, even if it does have Bluetooth connectivity? After all, this keyboard is probably 4 times the size of your standard tablet and probably weighs more than two of them put together.In the end analysis, this is a great keyboard for those with desktop computers but the tablet users would probably best be served by the much smaller versions without the numerical keypad.  This unit is just too large for tablet applications.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCTUAP30VHQVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R61TNTA#wasThisHelpful","RCTUAP30VHQVU","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let’s face facts, dropping close to $250 for a thermostat is a good chunk of change, so this unit had better perform.Physically, it’s a little bigger (5 x 4 inches, give or take) than your standard unit and at a shade over 1 inch it might be a little thicker, too.  The screen takes up roughly half of that forward facing real estate which puts it in the smartphone screen size category.As for that screen, it’s a touch model and is designed very much like a smartphone interface so it’s very easy to learn the basics.  If you’ve used an Android tablet or smartphone recently you’ll notice it right off the mark.Connection is a fairly straightforward proposition with a nicely designed manual coming in the pack so you’ll know which wires go where; however, make sure before you buy that your system has a dedicated 24V C wire (this may require an HVAC technician to check that out).  Why?  Because if your system doesn’t have this wire you’re out another 30 bucks for the “Add-A-Wire” accessory.In addition, if you see labels stating 120V or 240V this unit may not work, nor will it work with thick copper wiring or those utilizing wire nuts. In short, if your home was built prior to the 1980s or you have an older HVAC unit, this might not work for you.Fortunately, none of these stipulations applied to my HVAC and within a half hour I had it hooked up (and most of that was properly attaching the base plate to the wall with the included drywall setup).Once installed, it’s pretty much what you’d expect -- a thermostat.  However, it does have a touchscreen instead of the usual buttons.  Getting things setup is fairly intuitive and users have the option of setting up for daily temperatures, away temps and can even program it for various temps throughout a day (warmer in the morning and cooler at night, etc).Now on to that touchscreen.  It’s definitely an aesthetic wonder with cheery background images along with the text and users can even add their own background pictures if they so desire.  As I soon discovered, it can also double as a nightlight in a dark hallway (yes, it’s that bright!) although it does dim after a period of disuse.But the main draw for this unit is the WiFi access.  With this you can usual your tablet or smartphone to control the unit, even while you’re away.  You can also lock out the screen so nobody else can fool around with it and you can monitor energy usage.  In fact, I’m still playing with mine as you read this.One neat feature is that you can use internet weather information to set the thermostat for future weather.So, is it worth it?  Let’s review the pros and cons:Pros:*  Easier to use than one might think.  Once you have the basics the rest follows.*  WiFi access.  This also means you have a larger screen (probably) with your tablet to work with.*  Have more than one A/C running in your home?  This can coordinate with other similar thermostats to maintain different controls in various areas.*  Pleasant, if not attractive, interface.Cons:*  Costly.  Face it, it’s an electronic touch-screen unit with WiFi that has a price tag in the tablet arena.*  Don’t have the right wiring?  That’ll be $30 extra, please.*  Those with fat fingers need not apply.  Screen real estate, unless you use your tablet via WiFi, is slim.So, it all boils down to convenience and aesthetics in the long run.  If you need a Plain-Jane thermostat, this isn’t it; however, if you need more control over your HVAC and enjoy the gee-whiz gadgetry, this is the puppy for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NQ36D3BRNARR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6S1TX6#wasThisHelpful","R2NQ36D3BRNARR","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most natural products in this category utilize salts and minerals to dry up the oily, acne prone areas and this one fits the bill, although it’s categorized as all natural (and it does fit the bill, there).Past products I’ve tried have usually resulted in redness in the area directly after application with a gradual drying of the acne.This is no different in that respect.  In fact, you can physically see the salt and mineral residue once it dries.  Use it enough and you’ll have flaking skin in the application area within a couple days.But does this work?  To a point, yes.  It does dry up minor acne and helps in the healing process; however, those with overly sensitive skin may find that the first applications may exacerbate the acne before clearing it up.  If you can live with this then this product is for you.I am one of those with sensitive skin and usually have problems with acne on the shoulders even though I’m in my 50s.  In this area I don’t care if the problem gets worse before getting better, especially if the minor inconvenience of a little redness early on results in the acne disappearing quickly.There are a couple points to keep in mind:*  This does result in dryness in the treatment area so do have a moisturizer handy or risk flaking skin.*  It does sting, probably due to the salts used, so be aware of this.*  Instructions recommend leaving it on a few minutes, usually around 10, so this isn’t a spot treatment you can apply and forget about.  You do have to wash it off and then put a moisturizer on.*  As I’ve found out, make sure you wash your hands after usage.  Nothing like rubbing your eyes with salt residue still on your fingers to wake you up quickly.*  It’s rather pricey compared to chemical based alternatives already on the market.Although a decent choice for those desperate to rid themselves of persistent acne, I’m a little offput by the rather high price; however, it’s probably not too much more expensive than some products I’ve seen hyped on TV so the choice is largely personal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AJHFQDRP5EOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MY6FFH6#wasThisHelpful","R1AJHFQDRP5EOL","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My father has used a CPAP for years but has found that if he shifts to the side or attempts to sleep in offset positions his breather hose can kink and shut off or restrict his airflow.This pillow helps to alleviate most of those problems, especially when he decides to sleep on his side.  The hose now falls into the pillow groove and most of his problems are solved.From a construction standpoint, this is roughly the size of your standard bed pillow but is built in with blunt instead of tapered ends and it probably weighs about twice as much as you’d expect to normally see (due to dense construction).  It’s also on the firm side but the memory foam does give way and cradle the head without too much irritation.There are a couple things to watch off for, though.  First, the CPAP must be adjacent to the pillow so the hose falls into the canal.  If the machine is above or below the person’s head, the hose may go off to the side (landing partially in the groove with some of the hose on the pillow itself).Secondly, there is no easy way to use a standard pillowcase with this pillow.  To do so blocks the groove and makes it nearly impossible for the hose to find the groove.But those considerations are minor in comparison to the relief of not having to worry about a kinked hose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QC4IX7171DPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLM47GK#wasThisHelpful","R3QC4IX7171DPF","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s hard to get overly enthused with shower curtains, with most being nothing more than polyester sheets with holes in top, but this one does have a couple extra perks.First off, the top is hemmed for added strength.  Doesn’t sound like much, but I’ve had curtains where the manufacturer’s idea of hemming was to add embossed eyelets around the hook holes.  Takes no time for the unhemmed ones to rip apart up top.Additionally, the bottom is also hemmed and done in such as way as to avoid bunching.  If you’re unfamiliar with that problem, it’s when the curtain decides it’s no longer going to stay flat and instead opts to gather together in a couple areas leaving others exposed.Finally, the fabric is just heavy enough that this stays flat when pulled to the maximum length.  It also has a nicer-than-usual textured finish that’s better than the slick, “plasticy” feel you get with some polyester makes.Not a bad choice in shower curtains, especially if you have a family shower that is used often.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R118GVL1W4SIC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ME4GRMU#wasThisHelpful","R118GVL1W4SIC6","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best way to describe the construction of this unit is by stating it looks like your standard medical walker minus one side.  Instead of the center bracing holding the missing side it’s used as an extension that goes underneath a mattress for support.  In addition, there is a slightly shorter, outward swinging, extension used as a means of getting up from a bed.  Up top is an elastic pouch, of sorts, that can be used to hold books, water bottles, remote controls, etc.With that said, does it work?Assembly is simple enough with what appears to be aluminum tubing that fits together nicely and does seem stable.  The part that goes underneath the mattress is also comprised of tubing and looks to be a couple feet in length (it appears to be roughly half the length of a twin size bed, side to side).I gave this to my 90 year old father who uses it as a stability device when getting out of bed or when he needs to reach for something on a dresser near the bed.  So far it hasn’t moved much even though he puts his full 185 pounds on it.About the only fault he has found is the swing-out extension.  Since it does swing out and doesn’t lock into position, it more or less relies on its rubber feet for stability when under weight.  As such it can move just a little bit until the rubber foot grabs the surface so be aware of this, especially if you have tiled floors where the foot might come to rest on a crack instead of a full tile.Overall, a good product for those who need assistance getting out of bed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKHDTZ3VV68K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GJOD9A#wasThisHelpful","R1YKHDTZ3VV68K","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As vacuum cleaners go, it's kind of hard to get excited by a basic household tool, but some are better than others in this category.This unit does come with a few perks, a few of which I'll discuss here:1.  A 30 foot cord.  Chances are you'll be able to do a few rooms before having to find another plug.  In contrast, most cleaners I've come across stop at around 9 feet.2.  Easy to remove and clean filters.  Beats having to fork out big bucks for replaceable filters that clog to easily.  If you're into counting, I found 3 filters that should be cleaned with one outside the dustbin and the other two inside.3.  A combination sweeper/cleaner attachment for hardwood floors.  May not seem like much, but running a beater bar over laminate flooring is a surefire way of guaranteeing they'll be scratched.4.  The body detaches from the handle and wheel assembly to act as a canister unit.  Not necessarily a new technique but it's novel given that many vacuums today assume you don't mind manhandling a bulky unit up the stairs.Without getting long winded, I'll break my additional comments into the Pro and Con categories:Pro:*  Easy to assembly.  Essentially attach the handle and hose plus attachments and you're off to the races.  No screws or assorted fasteners to lose, it all clicks together.*  3 year warranty.  Most come with 1 year.*  Built solidly.  One of the few cleaners I've come across where the attachments didn't fall off during a normal vacuuming session.*  Lighter than it looks and much lighter than my comparably-sized Shark.*  Very good suction and beater bar action.  You can tell you've vacuumed over carpet with this unit because the bar tracks are readily visible.*  Although it's pretty much standard today, I still like the auto-height feature.  Makes life a whole lot simpler when you go from padded to unpadded carpeting.*  Easy to empty dustbin.  Remove the bin, hold it over the trash can and push the bottom release button.  Since it's almost a perfect cylinder in design with no protrusions, the dirt and hairballs just come sliding out.Con:*  No swivel head?  Really?  This means repositioning either the vacuum or yourself to get around table legs and the like.*  Short hose means you better not have something too high or too far away if you plan on using the canister or attachment functions.  A couple of times I had to hold the canister high in order to reach a ceiling corner or I'd have to stretch in order to reach all the areas in a laminate flooring area.*  Something jam up the beater bar and it won't rotate?  Use this method to unjam it -- call Dirt Devil.  Yep, that's actually in the manual.  Good thing, too, because I see no way of accessing the beater bar by removing a bottom plate.  Mine hasn't jammed yet but I can only wonder what it takes to disassembly this one.*  The only way to stop the beater bar is by putting the unit in the upright position or removing the main assembly for the canister function.  This means you can't run over laminate flooring without the ""swipe"" feature attached (the bristles could damage laminates).  How about a switch?*  Horrible cord setup.  The cord wrap sits way too close to the main hose and it's impossible to wind the cord and not hit it several times.  Definite redesign in order there, Dirt Devil.Overall I'd give this a very good rating.  The price is competitive compared to other over-hyped and over priced models and it does the job just a well.Update 1/3/15:  What engineer at Dirt Devil decided to put an informational sticker on the front of this unit that cannot be removed with anything short of jet fuel?  C'mon guys, this thing is put on worse than any dealer sticker I've ever had slapped on the back of a car.

"These are inexpensive hooks as an alternative to the more pricey, name brand products you usually see.  If fact, these sort of look to be a knock off, of sorts, but the price definitely makes them attractive.Installation is easy, just attach the tape and hook to the wall with removal just as easy -- pull down on the bottom tab until the whole assembly pops off.About the only downside I can see is the weight limitation of 1 pound per hook.  Usually, this means the hooks can hold twice that weight before dropping but my framed picture weighing in at 1.5 pounds put obvious stress on the hooks (the picture didn't fall, even after an hour, but I could see bowing).Otherwise, they are good for keys and the like.Of note, read the instructions and wait an hour or so before testing these as it takes that long for the tape to set properly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JOPGV50Y6TBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J12Q3ZY#wasThisHelpful","R2JOPGV50Y6TBJ","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve tried these in the past and they do seem to work, but I never actually owned one of my own (merely used them somewhere else) until now.Most of those I have tried looked like silver soap and were purposely designed to look like the standard bars you see in stores.  This one is different in that it actually looks like a mini football, so to speak.  It’s sleek and slender and looks a lot more fashionable sitting next to a sink; however, the picture you see in the description might give the impression it’s larger than it is.  In reality, this is about the size of maybe two mini-soaps you might find in your average hotel.Fashion and sizing aside, these metal soaps do seem to work, especially with those who work with smelly foods such as fish, cheese or onions.In fact, I’ve had a couple users tell me they’ve found secondary uses such as deodorants and for the removal of cigarette smoke from hands.

"Let's review the specs.  For $500 you get a 10.5 inch screen, ultra thin body with high resolution screen, a stated 9 hour battery runtime, around 10 ounces in weight and 3GB RAM.The new iPad?  Nope, it's the new entry from Samsung, the Galaxy Tab S 10.5.But let's be realistic -- it's designed to compete with the iPad in an attempt to topple the latter from its throne so comparisons must be made in that respect.As compared to the iPad Air, this unit has a slightly larger screen and maybe weighs a bit more, but otherwise they are nearly identical in these areas.  Both also sport robust construction although a few I know that compared this to the iPad state the Apple version has the sleek aluminum structure; however, there is no faulting the Samsung.Unfortunately, both do share a similar trait -- forgo a case and you also forgo grip.  Both are so light and thin they are literally a drop accident waiting to happen.And while both tip the financial scales at identical pricing, the Samsung has a few upgrades.  First, you get 3GB RAM instead of the usual 1 for the iPad, then you'll notice the rear camera has a flash and an 8MP rating as opposed to the lower resolution iPad version (with no flash), and, finally, you get a micro-SD card slot (something Apple has been ignoring for years).However, it's the screen that will amaze.  AMOLED technology means colors are bright and blacks are, well, eerily black (almost new car, shiny black).  This is quite a contrast from the iPad's more sedate screen, although both are still amazing considering the technology from the earlier tablets, but the truth remains that side-by-side, the Samsung's screen really stands out.In fact, after a short while I had to tone down the brightness some as this unit will actually light up a room.  Nighttime discreet is not in the cards here.Performance-wise the Samsung gets the newer Android 4.4 OS which has a bevy of improvements over previous versions, too many to mention here.  Let it suffice to say that speed is not a problem here and I enjoy the interface over iOS versions which don't allow main screen widgets and much in the way of related animations.  In short, if you desire an OS that allows for streaming news and interactive widgets, this is the puppy for you.However, there are some quirks here.  Android allows for folders to be created on the screen to house multiple apps and this is done by either moving apps on top of each other (ala' Apple) which creates a new folder or by holding a finger on the screen to bring up a submenu to create a folder; however, Samsung tweaked this procedure and has made it so the only way to create desktop folders is by holding an icon until a menu appears on top of the screen and then scooting the icon to that area to create a folder.  Time consuming and somewhat unnecessary.Samsung added one perk to the mix, though -- a fingerprint scanner.  Swipe your fingerprint at the center bottom of the screen when prompted and it'll open the  OS as if you entered a password (word of caution -- remember the password in case your finger doesn't pass muster).  Although initially impressed, it some became apparent it had about a 40% success rate and is not for the impatient since it requires a slow, methodical swiping of the finger.Sound reproduction is an ongoing problem with any tablet unless you opt for the headphones but Samsung hit it here.  Sound reproduction is great.Performance, unfortunately, does come at a cost, though.  Although rated at 9 hours of battery life (down from an original estimate by some of closer to 11), those ignoring the battery saver functions built in will find themselves seeking an outlet at closer to 7, as in my case.  To be fair, I was running videos and jumping all over the internet so your mileage may vary.  For those that sometimes ignore the battery warnings, there is a power mode that turns the screen from color to B&W and shuts down all but the essential apps.  Hopefully you don't have to use this mode much since you're getting down to the critical stage by that time but you can technically turn it on any time.On that power topic, I really couldn't find much that would cause this unit to lock up or slow down.  Even higher end, memory eating, games didn't seem to bother it much nor did forgetting to shut down the last 15 apps I opened while hammering away at another.  Guess that 3GB RAM does help a lot.So, are there any downsides here?  As with any tablet, including the vaunted iPad, there are faults:* Price is steep and encroaches on Apple territory.  Given the option of the Apple or Samsung at the same price, the vast majority chose the former.* Accessories?  What accessories? Few companies are producing cases and the like at this time and you can easily dump anywhere from $40 on up at Samsung's site to get cases which, oddly enough, seem to be lagging behind the release date of the tablet itself (although I may has misread that).  Because of the odd screen size (larger than the industry standard of 10.1"") you chance of making one of these fit into a generic tablet holder is about nil.* No 4G (or 3G for that matter) yet and capable models will not be out until later this year.  Oops, that's a biggie.* 16GB for main memory?  Really?  Yes, the Samsung does have a card slot that can accept up to 128GB, but not everything transfers to these cards (especially some apps) and transfer rates from these cards are still slower than the included drive.  Offer options here, folks.* Bloatware galore, and gimmicky stuff at that.  Fortunately, most of it just sits there and does nothing until you command differently; however, I was hoping those days were gone when tablets came out.  Problem is, some of that 16GB onboard is occupied with this stuff but I do have to commend Samsung for leaving what appears to be the majority on their website for download if desired.And, finally, there is the processor.  Instead of opting for the Intel Atom tablet series, Samsung opted to stay with the newest Enyxos quadcore version.  While wholly capable and probably just as appropriate as the Atom, the Intel name does carry cache over what was chosen.However, all things considered, Samsung could have a hit here, especially with those users not quite accustomed to Apple's version of ""take it or leave it"" iOS and lack of SD card support.  For the same price as a base Apple unit, Samsung buyers get more RAM, an SD card reader, the Android OS, and cameras with flash and better MP ratings.Update:  There have been a couple pesky little items that have cropped up that don't necessarily merit a drop in rating but should be kept in mind:*  The charger is just as bad as the old Apple iPad pre-Lightning version; however, it's even smaller and more fragile.  Mine is already starting to show signs of fatigue and there's no way of gingerly putting one in.  I can see this as an accident waiting to happen.*  Email notification is nothing short of lacking.  I have it on push yet this model is always behind my Apple  by at least a good couple minutes.  In addition, I'll delete an email only to have it suddenly reappear in my inbox.  Hmmm, something isn't right here.  Had to finally ignore the installed Samsung app and put in another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SLPGL4W9FNTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHA5G6G#wasThisHelpful","R3SLPGL4W9FNTK","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the literal sea of tablet offerings in the 7 to 8 inch class, it takes a lot to impress and it appears Asus is trying its level best to do so.  The real question is, have they succeeded?Boasting an Intel quad core Atom processor and a high resolution screen playing the newest Android 4.4 OS, it appears Asus is attempting to stand out in the $200 crowd.But can they succeed?  Previous MeMO versions sold at the big box stores did okay but were nothing spectacular and the tablet field is inundated with offerings that cost less (or more) so the competition is tough and standing out is even tougher.  Making matters worse for this field is the Apple iPad Mini which comes in with a higher price but a larger cache.For starters, this does pack the Intel processor and the newer OS, but Asus adding their own OS overlay called ZenUI, a design in which the start screen packs a lot of information that you can personalize; however, to be truthful there is only so much you can pack into such small real estate.The Asus also has a screen resolution normally found on larger screen units which does result in bright colors, vivid pics and non-stuttering videos plus you get the ubiquitous dual cameras, front and rear, but so does just about everybody else.Unfortunately, in an attempt to lengthen battery life, Asus took the low road and set screen brightness so low that even at maximum you're still pretty dim.  Readable, but still a bit dim.As for aesthetic qualities, they could best be described as minimalistic.  If nothing else, it's a flush, compact unit with nary a protrusion anywhere.  Buttons are flush mounted yet easily located and the rear surface is dimpled and easy to grasp and the only noticeable bumps on the front consist of the outside case border around the glass.  Otherwise it's smooth sailing, literally.Note to manufacturers -- it's nice to offer tablets in wild or sedate colors, but don't make an issue about it -- 99% of us are going to bury these in protective cases and only superheroes with x-ray vision will ever notice.In my testing I did find overall operations to be snappy and downright quick.  Battery life was a reasonable 7 to 8 hours which is about 1 hour shy of stated ratings.  In my experience this is about standard with manufacturer specs being about 1 hour off real world testing.  Video fluttering was nearly non-existent and apps flew open nearly as quickly as I could tap the icons.What probably helps the most here is the inclusion of Android 4.4, aka, Kit Kat (considering the logo is the Android robot made to look like the candy bar, one can only wonder what Google had to pay for those rights), the newest and fastest incantation in the Android line.  It adds tweaks and gizmos galore that will keep the average geek occupied for a while.And this is where the Asus outshines the Apple Mini -- the OS.  While iOS is a worthy competitor it lacks on-screen interactivity and widgets, in general.  Android has design and spark with vivid interactivity and the high resolution screen of the Asus helps a lot (although detractors state its overall specs are light, they fail to realize this is small package delivering the screen quality of a larger notebook).So, does the MeMO have any faults?  There are a few but they are relatively minor:* Who thought of moving the camera to the right edge from the center mounted variety found on earlier models?  This means users may get hands or fingers in the way (especially in landscape mode) and all older cases will no longer work even though the unit may fit.* Music and sound reproduction, although highly touted by Asus, is acceptable but not outstanding.  As one would expect, much better with headphones but as a standalone the sound is barely passable (and made worse by adding a case).* Screen brightness is limited and possibly too much so.  Even turning off the battery saving features didn't make the screen too much brighter.So, is the Asus a good buy?  In the $200 category, most definitely so.  Sure beats the competition in most respects and going any lower in price is a sure bet on disappointment.Update, 09/25/14After 4 months am I still enthused by this model?  Sorry, I had to drop a couple stars for the following:*  Every once in a while but at least twice a week, the speaker starts crackling and popping.  It goes away in a couple seconds but it makes no sense in that I'm not using the speakers at all in most cases.  It most recently did it in my public library when I had the unit muted.  This does not bode well.*  Waking up from sleep mode is dicey.  Sometimes it will, sometimes it won't and it's getting worse.  Occasionally a gray screen will appear and hang around for 15 or so seconds before my home screen shows.*  Going back to the home page from any app is equally perplexing.  More often than not the icons are nowhere to be found.  Fortunately, if I hang around long enough they will reappear.It appears my initial enthusiasm for this unit has been somewhat tempered by recent events but for something that's just a few months old you can see my concerns.Update, 10/10/14The problem mentioned in the previous update got so bad the unit started to become unresponsive.  So much so, I thought it had died when, in fact, it had gone to a gray screen.Finally talked to a guy at a local office supply store who is something of a tech and he mentioned customers had been griping about this problem, too.Turns out the tablet isn't bad, but a recent Android update has literally butchered the Zen UI that's included with this model and I guess the manufacturer hasn't quite gotten around to correcting it yet (if they are aware of it at all).  As a result, icons disappear on a random basis and getting the unit awake from sleep mode is anything but graceful or quick.Here's the workaround.  Install the Apex Launcher offered in the Play Store and when given the option make sure this launcher takes over for the Zen UI.That problem is now solved.  Icons come up instantly and waking up from sleep is back to a couple seconds.As for the popping noise, it still comes in every once in a while but the sound works fine otherwise.  I won't ding on that for now until I'm sure the update didn't do that, too (again, that problem didn't surface until the update).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TTZPFYLTECK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNAA54O#wasThisHelpful","R2TTZPFYLTECK9","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over time my tablet has replaced my laptop for most functions including writing reports, reviews and papers.Since I haven’t mastered the fine art of screen typing and dislike the thought of losing half my screen for that faux keyboard, I’ve opted for the separate Bluetooth keyboard and decided to give the Sharkk a try since the price is reasonable compared to Apple or Logitech options.Once it arrived I was pleased to see that it’s well built with an aluminum bottom and plastic top end with an overall size best described as ¾ of an iPad 2.  As for weight, my postal scale shows it as 8.3 ounces so this in combination with almost any tablet will have you going out the door at less than 2 pounds (lighter than almost any laptop).Out of the box it took about 2 hours to charge the battery (mini USB cord included so if you have charging blocks from just about any tablet this can be plugged in and used with those) and then it was off to the races.Pairing is a breeze -- turn on the power and push the connect button (which is just a tick too small but I’d guess it’s designed that way to avoid accidental activation) and within seconds your tablet or computer should have a notification of pairing attempt.  Pairing attempts worked just fine on my Apple desktop, iPad 2 and Samsung Galaxy tablet.Beyond that you’d expect it to be typing as usual, but there are a few perks and quirks here:* There is a hump on the back top that, I guess, houses the battery and wiring.  Also provides a slight pitch to the keyboard so it’s easier to type on versus the flatter units that look good initially but get tiring after a while.  That’s a plus.* Backlighting, and plenty of choices at that (you can cycle through the colors by pressing a lightbulb button and the arrow keys); however, mine only stayed on a short period and then would go out.  Positive for the backlighting but a ding for the limited amount of time in which it works.  Of note, this is great lighting that illuminates all the keys -- there is no mistaking one for another.* Due to size limitations, this is a netbook sized keyboard so you can expect some cramped typing.  While this unit may be good for students and casual typists, I would have to revert to my larger units for extended sessions.* Thanks for the velveteen cover, but maybe a plastic or aluminum top sleeve would be more appropriate.  While nice, the included cover appears to offer little more than cosmetic protection.* Power button is on the bottom.  Should be on the top or side if possible and the current placement means you have to lift the unit to turn it on or off; however, the auto-off function after a minute technically means you could just leave it on all the time (it reactivates with a simple tap of any key).For the price, a completely functional and reliable unit for the casual typist.  Certainly beats those silicone varieties sold at flea markets that have mushy keys!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D16V8E8MFZP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1HIVG8#wasThisHelpful","R2D16V8E8MFZP4","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This version of Colgate is a combination of whitening and fluoride protection, something that is all the buzz at the moment.While this toothpaste does have a pleasant taste and does leave a long-lasting sense of freshness, it does seem a little “pasty” in that this stuff is thick (really thick).  Best as I can figure it’s an attempt to make it adhere to the teeth a little longer but plan on scrubbing the sink if any falls there while brushing (and don’t let it dry or you’ll have the dental equivalent of caulk).As for whitening abilities, that’s tough to tell.  I’ve already been using this product and I’m sure it does aid in whitening to some degree, but if you’re an older person like me who drinks way too much coffee the effects may be limited.  Also, if you’re looking for the same type of white you might get from the dentist or those strips you find in stores, you might want to keep looking.Still a good choice, though, and you have the Colgate name to back up the product which is reassuring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R83JDTBMJB7PG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JIJ6GVG#wasThisHelpful","R83JDTBMJB7PG","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Have dry, chapped hands?  No for long you don't.*  The butter flavor is what I call a ""hint"".  You can sense it's there but you sort of have to find it.*  It's expensive -- much more so than the other buttery alternatives I mentioned earlier.Although I don't pop my corn using the old kettle method, I do believe this would be better used in that capacity which would cut down on some of the oil left on the popcorn while leaving some of the flavor intact.

Can for can, these are more expensive than the 6 packs of 12 ouncers -- somewhat goofy if you get right down to it and while some may say the price difference is minimal and justified due to the extra cans, it still doesn't make up for the fact that the cost per ounce is still more and that math doesn't sit well with me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R81PZHX45LQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZYDM3Q#wasThisHelpful","R3R81PZHX45LQX","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a big fan of instant coffee but I'll use it when traveling (I dislike paying big bucks for glorified swill) or if I'm in a hurry and don't feel like messing with wet grounds and filters.Instructions claim 1 to 2 teaspoons will do the trick but I'll add a caveat to that -- 1 is weak and 2 will peel the enamel off your teeth.  1.5, at least for me, if the proper mix.  Those liking really strong coffee can jack it up to 2 but I found that to be bitter.  1.5 teaspoons makes for a decent cup of coffee that I can dress up with creamer.One ding I will give is the jar design.  The top is a partial twist style, i.e., it twists either way and then pops off.  Instead of rigid plastic this one uses a flimsier design that buckles when you go to remove it.  I can smell a break coming any day and I believe a standard twist cap or even a push-on compression cap is a better choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21X9Z7VGOAUS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HKGB9ZW#wasThisHelpful","R21X9Z7VGOAUS7","A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this at a brick and mortar store Oct 3rd since Amazon didn't have any stock.[UPDATE Oct 30, 2015]: Logitech recently made an announcement about the surround sound.  The headset appears as a Stereo device to the operating system as an apparently unavoidable side-effect of moving to a new driver model.  Logitech claims the surround sound works as intended.  User experience tells us that it only works in a small number of games which provide the option to force surround audio output.  The overwhelming majority of games only produce stereo sound for the headset because that is what the operating system tells them to do.Logitech has made it clear that this behavior is as designed.  I may be foolish for it, but I still carry a glimmer of hope that Logitech will realize their mistake and make it right.  Until then, I encourage everyone who is stuck with a headset past its return window to download Razer Surround software.  This is a virtual device driver which will provide proper surround sound support to any headset including this one.  It isn't perfect and it isn't what you paid for, but hey, it is better than nothing.[END UPDATE]Pros:+ Comfortable to wear despite clamping fairly tight on the head.+ It has a power switch, not a power button, so you can more easily tell if it is on or off by looking at it or feeling it.+ Good sound quality.  I'm no audiophile but I think it sounds better than the older G930 headset did.+ Programmable G-Keys.  I use one as a push-to-talk key. For me, this is what really sets Logitech's gaming headsets apart from the competition.+ If this headset has an auto-shutoff feature, it hasn't bothered me yet.+ No random headset disconnects yet like I always used to get with G930 headsets!  I will update if this changes.Cons:- The current driver bundled with Logitech Gaming Software 8.74.80 has a serious bug.  The headset appears to Windows as if it only supports Stereo input, so games and other apps only send stereo audio, not multi-channel surround as they are supposed to.  According to a thread on Logitech's support forum, this bug is affecting all their surround headsets, not just this one, so I have faith that it will be fixed in a future software update.  Until then, it loses a star on my review.  Obviously this bug is not affecting everyone, but it is not yet clear why some are affected and some or not.- The volume wheel and G-Keys are smaller, further back, and harder to tell apart than they were on the older G930 headset.  This is probably because the earcups have removable faceplates on this model, so they couldn't put controls there like on the G930.- Forget about using it wirelessly with a cell phone for phone calls.  You have to plug the phone in to the headset using an included 3.5mm cable if you want to use it for a phone call.  There is a headphone jack on the USB transmitter which you can connect devices to, but the headset's microphone signal is not forwarded through this.Other notes:* The decorative lighting is enabled by default and takes several hours off your battery life.

"I had this lamp for a few months, using it only rarely, and while it worked it worked well.  Then a week ago, an ordinary zap of static electricity from my finger destroyed the lamp.  About 10 seconds after touching the lamp, I began detecting the distinct smell of burned electronics. Then the lamp came on all by itself and began cycling through its color temperature modes.  I unplugged it and took it apart to investigate.  The circuit board had a badly burned chip, and the heat had even begun to visibly melt a spot on the plastic enclosure.  This, in less than 30 seconds before I unplugged the power.  (see the photo I added)A lamp built to be touched should be more resistant to static electric shock than this.  This could have been much worse if I had left the room before smelling it.The lamp went into the trash and the seller, Angella's Lamp, kindly provided a full refund.  Interestingly, the seller seems to have now recycled this product listing to sell a different lamp while retaining the customer reviews from the old lamp.  I imagine Amazon doesn't care, given that Amazon regularly lumps together product reviews from completely different products anyway, but that seemed worth mentioning.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21WZK8OA08DT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISGLSKE#wasThisHelpful","R21WZK8OA08DT","A3NVZTGPORNPRW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NVZTGPORNPRW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The display is in Celsius and as far as I can tell there are no adjustments possible for brightness, calibration, or temperature format (so it can't display temperature in Fahrenheit).  No power supply is included, and you must wire it yourself to a 12 volt power source.  Accuracy is very good.  It measures within a fraction of a degree of my hot tub's built-in thermostat, and should make a nice backup temperature monitor for the tub while I am on winter vacations.

"I wasn't expecting much from a quadcopter this cheap but it has been fun.  I flew it nearly to death before discovering there were 3 flight sensitivity modes.  Little did I know the default setting is very subdued!  Press the left control stick inward to switch between sensitivity levels.  The right stick, when pressed, makes the next motion result in the copter doing a flip!  I also discovered this late.The copter comes with 4 spare blades but I got a pack of multi-colored extra blades from a 3rd party.  The 3rd party blades are compatible but I feel like their pitch is weaker and they break easier.  Notice that there are actually 2 different blade types -- all 4 are NOT the same.  2 blades are designed to rotate clockwise and the other two rotate counter-clockwise.The batteries in the controller (not included if I recall) are going to outlast the quadcopter.  After several hours of total flight (and crash) time, the copter is getting weaker and more jittery.

"I have a very specialized use for this fan.  I use it to cool the bottom half of a Gigabyte Intel i7-4770R Mini PC Barebones GB-BXi7-4770R, which is a very small PC with a 65 watt CPU in it.  This fan is a perfect fit because of its rubber feet, fan grilles, and large size that make it a perfect base for the little PC.It gets seriously hot inside that mini PC's case, partially because the bottom half of the machine doesn't have a cooling fan.  My mSata SSD was reaching temperatures in excess of 90 C, and the system crashed periodically.  When one stick of RAM and the 2.5 inch hard drive I had in there failed, I decided it was time to do something about the lack of ventilation.  So I removed the bottom of the case and placed it on this fan, having it blow air up into the casing.  I also added some small copper heatsinks to the SSD: Cosmos ® 8 PCS Copper VGA RAM Cooling Heatsinks cooler + Cosmos Cable Tie.

"Pros:+ Powerful CPU included while maintaining a low price+ Fairly light weight and easy to carry.+ Fans, CPU, motherboard, Optical drive, and RAM stick all pre-installed.+ Great for a 4-drive NAS server with enough CPU power for additional services to be run (e.g Plex, Minecraft, etc)+ Intel network adapter built in, not some junky Realtek.Cons:- Only 4 HDD bays, despite having room for at least 2 more.  More HDD bays and SATA ports would have been appreciated.- No option to buy without a RAM stick.Other thoughts:I run FreeNAS on it with 4x WD Red 6TB hard drives.  The FreeNAS OS runs off a very small USB flash drive I plugged in on the back.  I love the fact that I can't really build an equivalent system any cheaper, and with this, much of the assembly work is done for me.  I added more RAM (2x 8GB and 1x 4GB), Crucial brand Unbuffered ECC, for a total of 24 GB of RAM as recommended for FreeNAS to perform well with this storage capacity.  And it does run well.  The RAID-Z2 I built with this is an order of magnitude faster than my old 4-disk RAID 5 arrays that I have used in the past.

"I bought this shovel 4 years ago to clear my front porch of snow, and finally broke it this weekend when attempting to dislodge 6 weeks of heavy, packed snow into more-manageable chunks for my underpowered snow blower.  The shovel was being used as a pry-bar to break packed snow into smaller bricks and was overstressed such that the blade of the shovel split just below the curve.  The handle was more than strong enough for the stress, but the flatter part of the blade was not!  I bet, had it been made of aluminum or another metal, it would have bent rather than snapped.  But the shovel is almost entirely plastic and just could not handle the stress.I was happy enough with the first one that I have ordered a second.

"This replaced the over-two-years-old battery that my Galaxy S3 came with.  I let it charge overnight (12+ hours) and then unplugged my phone the next morning.  24 hours later it was still at 90% (only some light usage), and 30 hours in and it shows 86%.  The previous battery would have been stone dead by this point.  I finally plugged it in at 7%, 8 days 48 minutes after taking it off the charger!  Now, to be fair, I don't use my phone often.  A couple minutes a day is typical, so almost all of the time was spent with the phone idle, and sleeping.  But I do have it connected to WiFi and I run the Life360 app for GPS tracking in case I lose the phone, so I can go find it.  Bluetooth and NFC disabled.The battery adds significant weight to the phone, and when you use the provided (soft) case it is about the size of an Otterbox Defender case.  Several other reviews say you can modify an Otterbox Defender to fit this battery, so I might do that with mine.

" 0:30 Mins I have attached a video capture from the camera, which demonstrates the sensor resolution and frame rate.Pros:+ Most affordable thermal camera ever built and sold, by a very large margin.+ Image resolution is much higher than typical ""low cost"" (under $2000) thermal cameras, including the FLIR One.+ Very light and compact, yet sturdy+ Works with Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy S5, and Galaxy Tab S (although the app on the Tab S has frustrating screen orientation issues, it is usable).+ Easily capture still images and video clips.+ As of the December 2, 2014 app update, the temperatures are no longer offset by nearly 100 degrees, and appear to be more-or-less accurate.Cons:- Low frame rate.- The video skips a frame or two whenever the camera runs its self-calibration (coincides with a soft clicking noise)- App is buggy.  I have seen video corruption, black screens, and crashes.  These are thankfully uncommon, and can be fixed by restarting the app and/or reseating the camera in the Android device.- Accuracy of temperatures is questionable, as uniform surfaces appear as a gradient.  Supposedly Seek Thermal is working on solutions to this.- As of the December 2, 2014 app update, the emissivity selection control is visible, but seems to have no effect on anything.- No integrated visible-light camera, and the support for overlaying your Android device's normal camera is still very crude.Other thoughts:* Camera makes a soft clicking noise every few seconds when powered on.

"I normally used a powerful PC hooked up to my projector for streaming TV and movies.  I did not think a tiny little box like this could provide a good playback experience compared to a PC.  The Fire TV exceeded expectations in all regards.The first thing I noticed was that everything on the Fire TV runs buttery smooth.  I thought it would be tedious to scroll through TV shows and movies on the Fire TV, but it runs very well and there are practically no loading times when scrolling through Amazon's content.Amazon's Instant Video service dominates the user interface.  I really would have liked to see more complete integration with services like Netflix, but instead these streaming services are hidden away inside their own apps.  I fully understand why this is.  Obviously, Amazon wants their own content to take center stage.  But more than that, it is extremely difficult to integrate with 3rd party content providers at all, especially if you are going to dictate to them exactly how everything is going to work.  After trying a Roku TV stick, I appreciate this even more.  Speed issues with the Roku stick aside, Roku integrates all the services together better, but the interface feels relatively unpolished.  It is as though Roku had to design for the lowest common denominator.I should also note that I immediately wired the Fire TV with ethernet, and never tried it on WiFi.  WiFi is the cause of so many network problems that I don't think I would have bought Fire TV if it had not posessed an ethernet port.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G4SWTXNXIIYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX5P8FC#wasThisHelpful","R3G4SWTXNXIIYO","A3NVZTGPORNPRW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NVZTGPORNPRW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Woohoo!* Excellent color reproduction despite using a TN panel.* Good Picture-in-Picture (PIP) support.* Still usable without DPI scaling by the operating system, though you might have to sit close to read text.* Monitor is surprisingly thin and light compared to my previous 27 inch 2560x1440 monitors.* No dead or stuck pixels.Cons:* It doesn't work properly with my Win7/Nvidia PC unless I disable Aero glass.* Noticably more input lag than my other LCD monitors, but at the same time a lot less than a Seiki 39 inch 4k TV @ 30hz.* Has color distortion at odd view angles due to the TN panel it uses.* Occasionally a small graphical glitch will appear on the screen for a split second.  It is hardly noticable but suggests a minor connection problem.* Often when I boot up at the start of the day, the monitor is detected as having a max resolution of 1920x1080 or 2560x1440.  I have to power the monitor on and off, sometimes more than once, to fix this.* A couple times a week, at random during normal use, the monitor BLACKS OUT and goes completely unresponsive.  It has been doing this for the entire month and a half that I've owned it.  Basically the screen goes black, the power light turns off, and the power/menu button does not respond at all.  It does not recover by itself.  The only way to recover from this is to unplug the monitor's power and plug it back in.Other thoughts:* I have tried multiple displayport cables.  The monitor behaves the same regardless.* You can connect two HDMI sources and use them both simultaneiously.  One feeds the left half of the screen and the other feeds the right half.  There is no border between the halves, and they run at 60hz.  You can also have the displayport input use only half the screen if you want, and have HDMI feed the other.* I wonder if buying it early direct from South Korea is the reason I got such a flakey unit.* I have some alternative power bricks (14V 4A) on the way.  I am hopeful that these will resolve my blackout problem, and will update this review in a few weeks with my findings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BG4J9TJD5CH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEZGWI2#wasThisHelpful","R3BG4J9TJD5CH6","A3NVZTGPORNPRW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NVZTGPORNPRW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:+ Works with dimmable LED bulbs without flickering. (not all LED bulbs are dimmable)+ No issues working with Vera Lite control unit.  I can control the brightness as a percentage from 0 to 100% with 1% ""resolution"". (for 1% resolution in a Vera UI5 scene, go to the advanced tab for the scene).+ Small orange LED on front helps you find it in the dark.+ Only a very quiet buzz when on.  Can't really hear it unless it is silent in the house and you stand right next to it.Cons:- When you press the ""on"" button, there is about a 1 second delay for the lights to turn on, and another second for them to reach full brightness.  Similarly, it takes some time for the lights to dim to off when you press the ""off"" button.  Mostly it is the ""on"" delay that bothers me but I'm sure I will get used to it.Other thoughts:* A quick push of the top or bottom of the rocker turns the lights on (to the previous brightness) or off.  A long hold brightens or dims.* Minimum brightness (1%) is not quite enough power to turn on some LED bulbs.  Some of my bulbs won't turn on until I go to 7 or 8%, though they will stay on if I go back down to 1%.*** Important Installation Notes ***I installed 3 so far in a manufactured home constructed in 2001 by Nashua homes, and in every case I had to do some work to make it work.  In fact I was lucky to be able to do this without seriously tearing things apart and running new wire to half the house.  I am no electrician, but I now know enough about house wiring to be dangerous.The best way I can explain it is to say that these Evolve dimmers expect the light switches to lie in between the breaker box and the lights.  In other words these dimmers expect there to be two bundles of wire coming to the switch.  One bundle (lets call it bundle A) comes from the breaker box and the other bundle (B) goes to the lights.  Bundles A and B each contain a black wire, a white wire, and a bare copper wire.  The black wire from bundle A is called ""line"" or ""hot"" and the black wire from bundle B is called ""load"".  The white wires are ""common"" and the unshielded copper wires are ""ground"".  As far as I can tell, this is the minimum necessary to properly wire the Evolve dimmers.Unfortunately, this is not how the switches in my home were laid out.  The lights are between the breaker box and the switches, so each switch only has a single bundle of 3 wires: ground, line (hot / black),  and common (white).  Under normal circumstances this would have meant I had no choice but to return the evolve dimmers.  Fortunately in every situation so far I've been able to work out an alternative.My bedrooms each have two light switches right next to each other, intended for each switch to control a different bulb in the ceiling fixture.  Since the power comes in to the light, and I have two bundles of wire going to the switches, I was able to repurpose one of those bundles to pass power through the junction box in the ceiling and down to the switches.  The other bundle could then carry power back up to the light fixture.  This took some rewiring at each light fixture but once I knew what I was doing it was very easy.  (I really recommend you do not attempt this if you don't know what you are doing, or if your state/local laws require a licensed electrician for all electrical work!)My kitchen was more complicated.  I had a single switch and only a single bundle of wires to work with.  But I had an outlet 4 inches away on the same wall which belonged to a different electrical circuit.  I was able to disconnect the kitchen lights from their original circuit and run a new piece of romex wire behind the wall between the outlet and the switch to provide a power source for the switch.Lastly, my home was built with all-in-one switches that didn't need to be installed in a junction box.  Like most wall receptacles, these dimmers do require a junction box for safety (and for mounting to), so I had to cut the holes slightly larger and install old-work junction boxes at each switch location.All-in-all the installation was more than I had bargained for, but luckily it worked out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NTE9Z68SX0L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006U1TR9I#wasThisHelpful","R2NTE9Z68SX0L2","A3NVZTGPORNPRW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NVZTGPORNPRW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The surround sound feature is a complete scam.  The ""surround driver"" is now available (about a month after product release!), but all it does is add two virtual surround modes which tweak the way your audio plays.  The headphones remain a stereo (2-channel) audio device regardless.I even tested in a surround-capable game by throwing a grenade, immediately turning 180 degrees, and throwing another.  The resulting two explosion sounds were indistinguishable despite one being in front of my character and the other being behind.  This is no surprise, as the game is obviously outputting 2-channel audio to this 2-channel device.  You can't convert a 2-channel audio source into 7.1 positional audio just by slapping the Dolby name on it.  This is insulting.I have tried Wireless PC gaming headsets (with virtual surround) from Logitech, Creative, and Corsair, and all of these do surround sound properly.  They present 5 and/or 7-channel audio devices to the operating system, and they all do a fair job of recreating positional audio.  They can do this because they actually receive multi-channel audio signals.  But Turtle Beach falls way short.  The Z300 headphones only present a 2-channel audio device to the OS, and the surround sound features are 100% faked.  This is a very disappointing imitation of the surround sound available on wireless headphones that cost half as much.That aside:Pros:+ Good build quality.+ Microphone is very adjustable and removable.+ Volume control on the headset.+ Mic monitor volume control on the headset.+ Strong bluetooth audio support.+ Good sound quality+ Long battery life+ Clear voice status messages (i.e. ""Powering On"", ""Powering Off"", ""Game Mode 1"", ...)+ Average wireless range, with no cutouts when using it normally at my desk.Cons:- Outrageously high price tag for a 2 channel headset. (at least double what it is worth)- Advertised as a 7.1 surround sound headset, but it is only stereo.- Earcups are not deep enough.  My ears touch the inner padding (the stuff with the turtle beach logo) which is mildly irritating.- No configurable audio presets.  Just 4 game modes accessible via a button on the headset, plus the two gimmicky Dolby audio modes provided by the so-called ""surround driver"".","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35B75PPMIWFR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8T886S#wasThisHelpful","R35B75PPMIWFR3","A3NVZTGPORNPRW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NVZTGPORNPRW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Amazon's product description, at least, is for the HMZ-T3W at the time of this writing.Pros:+ Compatible with most eyeglasses, including mine.  Nearsighted people with glasses will need to wear them with this.+ Does not even touch your nose if you don't want it to.+ Wireless worked perfectly for me, but you can alternatively connect the battery pack to the processing box via HDMI and use it wired.+ Privacy.  Other people are unable to see the screens while you are wearing it, even if they try to peek around your head.+ Included earbuds sound good and feel high quality.+ Includes lots of extra rubber earpieces for the earbuds (different shapes).+ Compatible with most other headphones via the 3.5mm jack+ 3 HDMI inputs.  You can switch between them with the on-screen menu or by pressing the INPUT button on the processing unit.+ Reasonably light weight.  The T3 is the lightest Sony HMZ head-mounted-display yet.+ 100 - 240V power supplies, meaning they can be used in most other countries without converting voltage.+ Looking down, you can see below the device pretty well, allowing easy usage of keyboard, mouse, gamepad, or remote control.+ Compatible with nvidia 3D technology for stereoscopic games and 3D movie playback.+ You can choose over/under and side-by-side 3D formats through the on-screen menu, or leave it on auto mode if the application explicitly supports 3D output.Cons:- Difficult to position the viewer to get a clear, sharp image across the entire screen(s).  If the previous models were worse, I feel sorry for the owners of those models.  Having your eyes closer to the lenses does help.- Only 1280x720 resolution like the first 2 generations.  It is still a good looking display, but surely Sony could have upped it to 1080p by now.- HDMI pass-through only functions when the viewer is OFF, so you can't use the pass-through port to mirror your display with another device.  This is stated in the Startup Guide, and I also verified it myself.- The optional bottom rubber light blocker (included) presses into my nose uncomfortably.  It is also a bit tricky to attach.Other Thoughts:* The input connector to both power supplies (battery charger and processing box) is Volex VAC7S which is reasonably common.* The field of view is about as large as it can get while still allowing you to see all corners of the display.

No drivers required.  It just worked instantly.* I can output 1080p to my projector using a micro HDMI to HDMI adapter.* I have experienced no hardware or software glitches in the 5 days I've had it.Cons:* MicroSD card reader is slow.  Benchmarks maxed out at about 23 MB/s read and write on a SanDisk Extreme 32GB card that tests much higher (80 MB/s) in other devices.  See the customer images I submitted for full benchmark results.* MicroSD card sticks out a bit, making it less than ideal for a permanent storage upgrade.* Battery drains at about 0.5% to 1% per hour while sleeping. For comparison, my 3rd generation iPad loses no more than 4% sleeping for 24 hours.* Nearly half the storage is unavailable.  About 35 GB free space when new.* Shipped with dead battery and took 4 to 5 hours to charge to 100%.* Included charge cord is short.* The touchpad on the keyboard dock is pretty bad.  Clicks are loud and responsiveness is poor.Conclusion:It is a great little piece of hardware at a fair price ($400).  There are some shortcomings, but nothing critical.

"My house used to be a relative disaster of WiFi connectivity.  I previously ran two separate access points (APs) to get full coverage, each from a different brand, using different SSIDs, and as such they had to be configured on each device separately.  It was up to the device to switch APs.  This rarely worked as desired.  Occasionally, one of the APs would need rebooted to make it pass data to a wireless device.I bought a UniFi system because UniFi APs provide an entirely different kind of experience.  One built for enterprises that don't have the time or patience for the sort of nonsense I describe above.Basically, you install the UniFi controller software on a PC and give it an SSID (a network name) and password.  Then you start plugging UniFi APs into your wired network.  They appear in the UniFi interface as unmanaged APs.  You can adopt an unmanaged AP with a click or two and within moments that AP joins your network, extending its range.  Then, no matter how many APs you have adopted, your wireless devices will see them as one single network.  You connect to that network and then you can roam freely and the APs will work together to automatically switch you between APs as you go out of range of one and into range of another.  As long as you remain within range of one of the APs, you will stay connected.Now, since I had not bought the Long Range version, I figured the range on these would be similar to an ordinary home router.  Boy was I wrong.  I think I could put one of these anywhere in my house or garage and have usable WiFi everywhere else.  But just to be safe, I installed two of them -- in the locations I had kept my old APs.  The third AP is still in the box :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RFA2ZBEFSIJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EORRBW#wasThisHelpful","R3RFA2ZBEFSIJL","A3NVZTGPORNPRW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NVZTGPORNPRW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has 5 gigabit ports that can power most Ubiquiti gear (any that runs on 24 volts).  These use passive, non-standard PoE, so be sure you know what you are buying.  These get quite hot when several devices are being powered through them; moreso than any standard PoE switch I've used.I bought two of these to replace a rats nest of separate injectors, cables, additional switches, and power bars.  One of the switches works perfectly, but I've had trouble with the other.  On two occasions I have needed to unplug the switches to rearrange the networking gear in my garage.  On both occasions, the troublesome switch booted up but was unable to pass any data through the main 5 ports.  I could access the web interface through the management port only.  The solution on both occasions was to unplug the switch for a few hours and plug it back in when it had cooled off.  Once it starts working, it doesn't stop working unless I power cycle it while hot.Anyway, I've been running them for several months now and have had no performance issues besides that which I mentioned above.  All in all, these are nice switches to have if you need to power a lot of Ubiquiti devices in one place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6X27KXMRTMR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXTK90W#wasThisHelpful","R6X27KXMRTMR7","A3NVZTGPORNPRW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NVZTGPORNPRW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With this, I was able to replace six 8-port switches and reduce clutter in my garage which serves as a hub for my network camera hobby.  18 of the 10/100 ports are in use, 14 of them using PoE, and 3 of the gigabit ports are in use.  No problems at all with connectivity or transfer speeds.  According to the web interface, I use about 50 watts of PoE during the day and just under 100 watts at night when all my cameras turn on their IR LEDs.The web interface uses a ridiculously slow web server.  When loading the administration pages, it can't seem to send faster than 10 KB/s and it appears to only allow one active network stream at a time.  This is connected via gigabit ethernet but the web interface pages load almost as slow as if they were hosted via dialup!  Minus one star for that.  Fortunately, the web interface isn't something I foresee needing to use very often.Coming from a consumer background where network switches are almost always silent, it is important to note that this one is not.  It has at least two fans and they are most definitely audible.  This isn't something you'd want to put in a room where silence is valued.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9UM8OOMGT857/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000M0WALA#wasThisHelpful","R9UM8OOMGT857","A3NVZTGPORNPRW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NVZTGPORNPRW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a software developer who had a game ready to launch since March when the Kickstarter rewards were supposed to be shipped.  Even though I backed them on the first day of their Kickstarter, I didn't receive my OUYA until near the end of July (about a month after it became available here on Amazon!).  No, I don't live on a remote island somewhere.  I'm located in the lower 48 states of the USA, so there is no excuse for the absurdly long delay.[Controllers]When the console finally arrived, I quickly discovered that the controllers leave a lot to be desired, as one of the first setup steps is to enter your account information (and mandatory payment information!) using an on-screen keyboard.  The controller's touchpad is among the worst I have ever used, due mainly to the ridiculous acceleration and immediately noticable input lag.This leaves the D-Pad and analog sticks for navigating the on-screen keyboard.  These controls are generally much more responsive but still suffer from intermittent input lag while playing a game.  The analog sticks are surprisingly okay, but the D-Pad is terrible.  It is way too easy for you to accidentally move diagonally when you intended to move just vertically or horizontally using the D-Pad.  It is in fact easier for me to be precise using the left analog stick to navigate both on the on-screen keyboard and in games where I have the option.Despite their many flaws, the controllers are significantly more expensive than wireless Xbox, Playstation, or PC gamepads.  They should probably cost half as much.** FYI, you can plug in a USB keyboard to greatly ease and accelerate the setup process.[Console Hardware]The console itself has a nice appearance.  It is small, attractive, quiet, and simple.  The guts of the console aren't very fast, but I suppose you really can't expect too much from a computer at this price point.[Software]The OUYA software is remarkably simple and there doesn't seem to be that much to it.  Basically you have a ""Discover"" section where you go to browse and download games, and a ""Play"" section where you go to play games you've already downloaded.  There is a little more to it than that, but nothing particularly noteworthy.As a developer (and user), I'm a little irritated by the behavior of the menu button in the center of the controller.  If you long-press or double-press that button, the game EXITS immediately and you are returned to the OUYA menu.  This wouldn't be such a big deal, but there is no other convenient pause / menu button on the controller, so games typically use it as their normal pause or menu button.  This means if you are not careful pressing it then you could be in for a nasty surprise![My game]It isn't released just yet, and I mention my game only to aid in sharing my experience as an OUYA developer.  I do not mean to advertise here, so I won't even mention the name of my game, but I will say that it is based on the old classic ""Bomberman"" so it plays on a 2 dimensional grid.  As such, it uses very simple logic and the system hardware requirements scale in direct relation to the size of the game world.I had intended for the game to support a configurable world size so that players could really take advantage of a 1080p display by zooming out and having a huge world.  On my development machine, I could scale the world far beyond any reasonable point without making the frame rate even quiver below 60 FPS. But it turns out that even at the modest default size, OUYA can't maintain a steady 60 FPS once bombs start going off.  This was very disappointing, but not entirely unexpected.The reason for the further delay in releasing my game is partially my fault, and partially OUYA's fault.  Back in 2012, I created two accounts by accident. (I know, I know.  How do you accidentally create a second account, right?)  One way or another, my user name and my game got configured on different accounts and I didn't notice until I was about to submit the game nearly 3 weeks ago.  So I submitted a support ticket asking to have the accounts merged and I haven't had a response yet.  Not a peep.  Not even an automated ""we're bogged down right now"" message.[Conclusion]The OUYA may be small and good looking, but it performs even slower than I expected.The controller is garbage. Expensive garbage.Support is so laughably slow that I have to wonder just how many other people are having a problem with them too.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MKF03NICB0CC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SZD18#wasThisHelpful","R2MKF03NICB0CC","A3NVZTGPORNPRW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NVZTGPORNPRW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an interesting book. I never paid a lot of attention to the Food Pyramid. It always sounded weird to me. I'm old enough to have grown up with the 4 Food Groups, where we were told to eat some of each of them. But I was as confused as anyone about how all of the different diets could all work when they were so different. Not only does she go into why we got stuck with the food pyramid, she also explains how all those different eating systems could all work, but for different people She also explained a lot about how to read scientific papers, and includes a few, explaining afterward all the ""big words"" that frankly make those documents unreadable for anyone outside of the scientific community. It isn't the big words so much as all the abbreviation that you don't get explained.This is a very readable book. The author has a sense of humor where appropriate and also can be deadly serious when that is what we need.

There is some movement in the lives of the regular characters, but it isn't all that much. This may not be true if the series gets very long, however. But basically this is a series where the mysteries have most of the emphasis. And I like that about it.So far both books have been well written and pretty much page turners, with none of the problems in logic that a mystery series could have. It is a paranormal mystery series, but it is more how the two detectives deal with being on a unit that specializes in supernatural crimes that makes it paranormal than anything else.Basically I have enjoyed reading what I've read, and if there are more I will be buying them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHQOL6VUQMPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053CTN4O#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHQOL6VUQMPJ","A3ETEBL6SRZYOZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ETEBL6SRZYOZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As a result I've bought several other organizers from IRIS and I've been happy with all of them. They make an excellent product.Even full, I can manage to move the cart so it can be moved out of the way when the room I'm using as a studio needs to be used as a bedroom. And I am not the strongest woman out there. The cart does not complain about being moved and I'm not afraid it will fall apart if it is moved. The wheels are there for a reason and they do what they are supposed to do. I am very happy with the cart after several weeks of using it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V1G2FO1LKVTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00447PDG6#wasThisHelpful","R2V1G2FO1LKVTZ","A3ETEBL6SRZYOZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ETEBL6SRZYOZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You have to understand what this book is. It is not a book written from a devotional point of view. It is a book written from a scholarly point of view. It is not a book trying to debunk religion, but it is a book that asks you to read what you are reading from the point of view of the original readers of the book, and to understand what the original intent of the individual books of the bible had in their own time.I learned a lot from what I read. I already am of the opinion that people wrote the bible, so figuring out what those people were trying to say made sense to me. But on the other hand, as a believer, I was glad I wasn't also trying to deal with an author who was trying to convince me all faith was nonsense.If you believe in the inerrancy of the bible, you won't be happy with this book.

"I like Logic Puzzles, so I got this app in addition to the one I already had and liked so much. But there are some real problems with the app, so I can't recommend it. First of all at least one of the puzzles has a bad error. You are told someone IS something, but in reality he IS NOT that something. Which means you will lose the puzzle. If you can't trust the clues to be correct, you can't play.The other problems with the app aren't deal killers. When you choose the yes answer, all of the nos are not put in for you. You have to put them in one at a time yourself. That is just frustrating, but it isn't a deal killer. If you hit the X instead of the DOT when you figure out an answer you get a buzzer. That is OK. It won't let you put in a wrong answer. But if you have already put in the DOT for that line and try to put a second DOT in, it is because you've mistakenly hit the DOT instead of the X. Do it 3 times and you are shoved out of the game.The various parts of each game is shuffled every time you play, so remembering the answer from the last time won't help you. That is good. But sometimes the hints just cancel each other out, and that is just silly. There is also style in creating clues, and you get some really dumbly worded clues in this app.I stopped playing well before I'd tried all the games. Too many bad clues to even continue.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB6RNYVIOPTVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C99ICSW#wasThisHelpful","RB6RNYVIOPTVB","A3ETEBL6SRZYOZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ETEBL6SRZYOZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Warren the 13th and the All-Seeing Eye is a charming illustrated mystery with a touch of scary, but only in a good way. Warren the 13th is the heir to a once grand hotel that became shabby and empty after his father died and his lazy uncle became his guardian. The hotel supposedly has a secret treasure, the All-Seeing Eye. Warren's new Aunt, Anaconda, is desperately seeking the Eye so that she may regain her witchly powers and do all sorts of evil things. Warren is a sweet, hard-working lad who does his best to take care of the hotel while attempting to avoid his nasty aunt and her punishments. As Anaconda searches for the Eye, events unfold that lead Warren to discover more about himself and the secrets of the hotel. This is a fun read, charmingly illustrated.

"I selected these because I like the dark eggplant color and I needed something bigger than a washcloth, but not as big as a towel to use with my foster kittens.

"Sleek and stylish but very much functional. This will be the 6th battery backup that I’ve owned and used. By far it’s the best, this is due mostly to the form factor. The other backups were formed like small squares about the dimensions of a deck of cards but twice as thick. They didn’t fit in next to my phone very well always leaving a large bulge in the bag or pocket they were in while it charged. With this unit it is almost the height and width as my phone but much thinner so it slides right into the carrying pocket or bracket for my phone. This makes its on-the-go use so much easier. The brushed aluminum look hides scratches and dings, making it less of an eye sore.The charging cable that comes with it is a little long for me but not overly so, allowing a little leeway if you need to have them in separate pockets. By using a USB port, you can easily replace it with any after-market snubby cord or the charge cord that came with your device.I’ve used this back up on a Galaxy SIII and on three of the newer 7 inch Galaxy Tabs. In each case the charging was quick till about 80% and then tapered off, total charge time of maybe 30-40 minutes. Off a single recharge I could completely power all of the devises from 12% and have enough for about a 10-20% charge on a second device. I only used the 2.4 amp slot and only on one device at a time.The only reason for the 4 stars vs 5 is that the casing is not seamless, the front of the backup could very easily develop dings and snags that could lead to opening if dropped or slammed against things in a bag. Since it is designed to be portable in places that are remote enough not to have a wall charging option it should be a little more rugged than a wall charger. Overall, this is a minor quibble and I'm pleased with this charger.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZE3HUWSWVXG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UN9C178#wasThisHelpful","R1ZE3HUWSWVXG6","A15D2X8MICR2VQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15D2X8MICR2VQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though this is technically the 3rd book in the Nantucket Brides trilogy, it works ok as a stand-alone book. It's still best if you read it after the other two though. Hallie is a newly graduated physical therapist and when the opportunity arises to basically start fresh on Nantucket, she jumps on it. She's helping Jaime Taggert, a wounded man with scars both physical and emotional. Throughout the book, they learn to trust and love, helped in part by the two sisters haunting Hallie's new home. There are references to characters from the two previous Nantucket Brides books, as well as previous Jude Deveraux novels. It's a fun summer read and feels like visiting an old friend. If you're a Jude Deveraux fan, I'd definitely recommend this trilogy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK1X9CPNS6OES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345541855#wasThisHelpful","RK1X9CPNS6OES","A15D2X8MICR2VQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15D2X8MICR2VQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one large super soaker and I'm not sure that's a good thing if you're purchasing for a child. The 'wow' factor of this super soaker seems to be that you can attach it to a hose and have a continuous stream of water. Unfortunately, it leaks like a sieve when attached to the hose and you can't really move around or the quick release adapter will snap off. Also, you have to have the compartment filled with water in order to use the hose; otherwise you're just standing there waiting for the compartment to fill up while everyone else is shooting you. When full, it's rather heavy and works in a similar fashion to other super soakers in regards to spray pressure and distance.

"If you're a person who likes a variety of scents, this might be the perfect pack for you. I received 6 different scents, ranging from Cherry Pie to Olive Oil. The packaging wasn't the greatest, as the bottles looked like they had been tossed into the box. Thankfully, none of my selection arrived broken or leaking, but I have a feeling that was luck more than anything else. The bottles are a bit larger than your average $1 a bottle liquid soap, although the price per bottle seems a bit higher too so it evens out. Cherry Pie and Mango were the definite hits in this household, while Olive Oil and Almond were definite nots. The soap itself cleans well and the scent isn't too overpowering after you've rinsed your hands. The not testing on animals is a definite point in company's favor and I'd consider buying the Cherry Pie and Mango versions alone.

"Invisible is book two in the Twixt series, after Indelible. I read Indelible first, and I'm glad I did. You could read Invisible as a stand-alone, but I believe the relationship between Joy and Ink is much more understandable with the back story of the first book. In this sequel, Joy is no longer bound to Ink, causing the council to fear her. As she navigates her changing relationship with Ink, her family and friends, she makes decisions that force her to grow up. I really enjoyed the secondary plot of her brother's secret and how the author explored Joy's relationship with him. For the most part, her relationship with her best friend was well done, especially one particular conversation between the two girls. I think Joy made some rather idiotic decisions in the middle of the book, but that makes her more realistic, not less.

"Now that I’ve gotten the hang of using my cast iron skillets and roasting pan I figured it was a good time to move on to the next staple everyone says is a must have, the Dutch oven. While it is cast iron, the care for this unit is much different. Unfortunately you’ll either have to self-educate yourself about it or make a costly error. The instructions that come with the Casserole are basic, meant to cover La Cuisine’s entire line, making them overly general and not very helpful to someone who is purchasing their first enameled cast iron. For the most part they say what a lot of other reviewers have said, you can put it in the dishwasher, but it’s better to wash by hand. Also counter to all cooking instruction I’ve read up to this point, you can’t heat it up without something in it, apparently it causes the enamel to release from the cast iron if done repeatedly. I have spent less than $20 for a Lodge 10 inch cast iron skillet and the instructions were much more detailed.Overall I am impressed with the results I’ve been able to achieve. Until now I’ve had to use a cast iron skillet to sear the meat for my roast, use a large pot to par-boil the vegetables and a crockpot slow cooker to make it a meal. Now I can do it all in one, in a quarter of the time and with much less clean up. What used to take 7-8 hours now takes a little more than 2 with slightly better results.Clean up is a snap, you can use soap but you still have to be careful fully rinse and completely dry it before you put it away. I’ve read that the non-stick gets better with time, but only if you don’t use an abrasive scrubber or cleaning agent. Water, vinegar and some soaking time on the stove is all I’ve had to use so far and the results have been very pleasant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UOEQ26WTQ1A0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PP60MIE#wasThisHelpful","R3UOEQ26WTQ1A0","A15D2X8MICR2VQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15D2X8MICR2VQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A Brighter Tomorrow: My Journey with Julie is another nice addition to the new American Girl Beforever line. This, like all the other 'My Journey' books, is set up in a choose-your-own-adventure type format. In this story, a modern girl who's recently moved to San Franciso travels back to the 70s and meets Julie. Both girls are experiencing the big 'D', divorce, and the book emphasizes family and feelings. To me this is the least historically educational book of the line, mainly because the setting is so similar to present day. The one aspect that I really enjoyed about the other books in the series was that your child could be learning a little bit of history with the story. Julie's story, (except for the fact that she can't play sports at school), seems lacking in this regard. Also, like the other books in this series, you're directed the AG website for an ending, so be warned. Don't get me wrong, it's a sweet story, and I think it would appeal to a reluctant reader.

"The Roar of the Falls: My Journey with Kaya is another nice addition to the American Girl Beforever series. These books are set up in a choose your own adventure type format, although overall I think there's fewer endings than a traditional cyoa book. In this book, our unnamed modern girl is supposed to be a leading a gardening project while she struggles with shyness and a lack of self-confidence. While gardening, she discovers a shell, which when she makes it into a bracelet transports her back to the past. She meets Kaya, a young Native American girl living on the Columbia River in the 1700s. By making different choices, our modern girl experiences a variety of different adventures and meets Kaya's friends and family. I hadn't read much about Kaya previously as my daughter was more interested in other AG characters. This story definitely left both of us wanting to learn more about Kaya and her world.

"Set 10 years after Not a Drop to Drink, In a Handful of Dust shows us Lynn and Lucy settled in their small community. Lynn has raised Lucy as her own, and their affection for each other is evident. Unfortunately, their lives are soon torn about by an outbreak of polio and the sudden destruction it brings. Lucy may be a carrier, so they set out to California to escape what's left behind and in search of something new. Their journey takes them across the Midwest, through the Great Plains and over the mountains. In this book Lucy is the central figure, rather than Lynn and I do think it suffers a bit from that. Lucy's life has been easier than Lynn's at the same age, and I just didn't find her as compelling a character. That being said, this is still an excellent read. Both characters are very believable and it's refreshing to see a positive relationship between a young woman and her mother figure.

"My daughter and I have read the majority of the new American Girl Beforever books, and I have to say, this one is probably my favorite. Our modern girl fails a test at school. With her dad working far away and her mom going to school and working, her grandparents are helping out at home. Her grandparents deal with her failing the test in a firm, but fair manner but she's still feeling sad mixed in with missing her dad. When she rubs an old, family coin, she's transported back to 1864, where she meets Addy. Addy is an escaped slave, living in Philadelphia with her mom. Her brother and dad were sold, and they had to leave her baby sister behind. Right off the bat, our modern girl is faced with the discrimination and the daily trials of being black, even if you're free, during the Civil War time period. Even though my daughter had read books about the civil war before, I think one did a good job of making history seem more real and vivid. My only complaints were the fact that you may be directed to the American Girl website to finish a particular storyline. Also, this book seemed to have fewer endings than others in the series. Overall, this is a good book to introduce your child to Addy and her time period without investing in a whole box set or buying the doll.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UONMEE0ME7BX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160958418X#wasThisHelpful","R2UONMEE0ME7BX","A15D2X8MICR2VQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15D2X8MICR2VQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Catch the Wind: My Journey with Caroline is good way to introduce a young reader to the American Girl books. It's set up in a choose your own adventure type format with a good amount of historical facts and tidbits. I like the fact that a child can read these books to see what character appeals to them most, before committing to a 6 book set that may or may not be fully read.Basically you read along as a girl whose mother, a Navy doctor, is about to deploy. She's upset/sad/scared for her mom and a little bit resentful of having to take on more responsibilities around the house with her mom being gone. Her mom gives her an antique, family compass that when held a certain way, takes our unnamed girl back to the past. She quickly meets Caroline and then the adventures begin. The story is set during the War of 1812. By making choices at certain turning points, there's a good variety of different adventures to read. Not as many as you'd find in a classic Choose Your Own Adventure book, but enough to get a rough understanding of Caroline's time period and some history.This is a quick read, and I didn't like that there was an option to take you online to finish the story. Not everyone has access to a computer or tablet. It also disrupts the flow of the story to have to put the book down, log in, find what you're looking for, etc... My daughter liked the variety of endings; although it wasn't her favorite story of the Beforever books we've read so far. I think this has to do more with the fact that she hasn't had much exposure to Caroline before. A girl more interested in this specific time period may absolutely love it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCVGEA6OHZVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609584473#wasThisHelpful","R3CCVGEA6OHZVL","A15D2X8MICR2VQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15D2X8MICR2VQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Plague of Bogles is the second book in the series, after How to Catch a Bogle. In this story, Birdie is living with Miss Eames while Alfred the bogler has moved residences, trying to leave his bogler past behind. Jem was let go from his position and is trying to eek out a living in and on the mean streets of London. Thankfully, fate intervenes and Jem becomes Alfred's new bogler boy (on a probationary status) while Alfred and co. try to find out where a massive surge of bogles is coming from before any more children go missing.This book picks up fairly recently after How to Catch a Bogle ends and, like the first book, is rollicking fun. You don't have to read the first book, but I think doing so deepens the stories and the characters. It's a bit on the dark side, especially when they discover exactly who is feeding the bogles and what the bogles are being fed. I don't think it's too gruesome though; my tween tore right through both books and she's the sensitive sort. The characters are well described, as is London. The story is catchy and fast-paced. Overall, this is a fun series that's a little bit scary and a lot of 'can't stop reading, must finish'. The ending definitely hints at a third book to come and I'll be looking for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYVZFZCYU2G30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054408747X#wasThisHelpful","RYVZFZCYU2G30","A15D2X8MICR2VQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15D2X8MICR2VQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice, straight forward drill book. I really liked the drill finder in the beginning of the book to help you easily skim down the available drills so you could quickly compare. Drills were also broken down into types such as dribbling drills or shooting drills to make it even easier to find a specific drill type easily. The included diagrams are basic, but effective. The related drills tip for each drill is also a nice bonus, in case you want to add a bit of variety to keep things animated. More experienced coaches might find it a bit simplistic, but I think this would be a great resource for a new coach or a parent who wants to work with their child at home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4DBOSQWV7769/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1450468233#wasThisHelpful","R4DBOSQWV7769","A15D2X8MICR2VQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15D2X8MICR2VQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This merkin is beautiful, functional, and of the highest quality.  However, it needs to be kept coated in Jheri Curl at all times to retain its shiny appearance.  This issue caused significant problems for me when the Pepsi commercial pyrotechnics lit it on fire.  My genitals were scarred to the point that no hair remained (neither mine, nor the merkin's), and so I had to get a second merkin.  I eventually decided upon a Caucasian-looking merkin with straighter hair and no need for the Jheri Curl.It took me a while to recover from my injuries, as well.  While in the hospital burn unit, I took large doses of prescription medication which led to a snowballing dependence on painkillers, and this fueled increasingly bizarre behavior both on and off stage.  The high mercury content in the skin-whitening agents used for masking penis vitiligo didn't help my sanity any, either.  Eventually Los Angeles County incorrectly accused me of being a pedophile, I nearly went bankrupt from uncontrolled spending, and I died from general anesthesia given to my by a doctor so stupid he tried to resuscitate my emaciated corpse on a suspension bed.

"New Oreo-flavored Oreos are the latest thing in self-referential snacking technology!  By eating the creamy center first, which is itself composed of smaller pieces of Oreo Blizzard cookie, you'll learn to appreciate the arbitrarily-large consistency of Nabisco's latest tasty confection.  (Although the experience might seem incomplete, please remember: no crunchy snack biscuit can be both consistent AND complete.)These delicious recursive treats are about as close as you can get to the set of all sets without breaking all of mathematics.  Even famed logician Kurt Gödel might not have starved himself to death if he'd had these in his cupboard!  Don't trust Zeno of Elea: these cookies will only stay on store shelves for a finite period of time.  Do yourself a favor and grab a bag while non-infinitesimal quantities last.In summary, each Oreo Blizzard cookie is every bit as awesome as an Oreo Blizzard cookie.

"The tree looks nice with gum drops, but there's a selling point they missed: the size of the display/toy is simply perfect for little kids' fingers!  A child's dainty digits can fit into all the nooks and crannies of the tree, which makes it much easier to load (or unload) the tasty treats.  Essentially, using the tree is much easier if you have access to kids, and any toy that encourages child involvement is sure to be a hit with the whole family!To top it all off, the tree is expertly designed to allow sweet drippings from each treat to flow down the branch-work to the plate below, where they are collected.  The crimson rivulets and copper-scented puddle which form when used in this manner make a beautiful and functional addition to the tree's credit.My only criticism: it would be nice if this item could be sold in tandem with a covering bell jar.  Flies will take to the puddle almost immediately, and the odor is less than pleasant once the fluid begins to coagulate.

"For years I used actual tampons to smuggle liquor, and it was a difficult learning process with trial and error.  It took several tries to discover that unused tampons hold more liquor than used tampons.  However, the technique was still problematic as I would absorb the alcohol too quickly.  Once I realized you could siphon the booze orally, things went much more smoothly.  But if you don't add the food coloring you can get caught, and if you do add it people look at you very strangely (which doesn't make much sense to me given the current popularity of vampires in the media).Well, this is definitely the best method for using tampons to hold liquor that I've seen.  Not only does it hold several ounces of liquor, completely eliminating the inconvenience of drinking a tiny amount of alcohol before arriving at an event, but it also looks much more natural to tilt a tampon container directly against your lips: significantly less sucking and munching draws less attention, oddly enough.We truly live in an amazing time.

"I too have been spammed by the author (under the address of review73@aol.com).  All you have to do to see that this book poorly written and extremely unfunny is to ""look inside"" at the preview.  Go ahead, take a look.  You'll be stunned by how bad the portions of the book are which the author is actually willing to show you for free.Even though this is a work of intended tongue-in-cheek humor, it is neither parody (it has nothing to do with genetics) nor satire (it has no large analogy to make, as far as I can tell).  Further, the author apparently has no idea what a ""gene pool"" actually is, which is kind of important if you want to use it as a basis for humor.  Example, from page 2: ""The human gene pool is the summation of all that has happened or learned since the earliest form of bi-pods [sic] first stood on the earth.""  Sorry...that's not ""humorously"" wrong, that's just uneducated.Nearly all of the ""humor"" in the book preview comes from the author insulting the audience, which is tiresome after the first few pages.  Again, check out the preview...you don't actually have to purchase the book to see this.  (Thank you Amazon!!!)  Oh, and the stale pun name ""O.E. Vey"" appears on every other page.  So if you've read this and looked at the preview and buy the book anyway...well, maybe you prove the author's only point: the reader should be thinned from the gene pool.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIU1ZT7TPITKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1432726072#wasThisHelpful","RIU1ZT7TPITKQ","A3O0N809QTYZ56","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O0N809QTYZ56?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I never took Niacin but as a supplement it has properties that help the cardiovascular system and it dilates all vessels in the body enhancing the oxygen exchange. I don't suffer from any heart related disease but I take niacin just for well being.Niacin, or vitamin B3, as it is also known, is involved in over 50 metabolic processes that are meant to turn carbohydrates into energy. Besides providing energy to the cells from the entire body, niacin is also responsible for the integrity of these cells. Further on are listed some of the processes niacin participates in:• Antioxidant effect• Blood sugar control• Decrease of cholesterol levels• Detoxification• Production of adrenal hormones• Production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach• Production of sex hormonesWith Niacin comes the niacin flush. The first time I took one of these pills, I became red like a tomato and hot like fire. Honestly it was a scary moment but it lasted only for few minutes and then everything was back to normal.I understand the flush is a normal effect and some people may be more reactive than others. I've learned that if I take niacin with a drink in the morning I'll get the flush but if I add something solid, I will not.No complains about the product.Vitamin B3 will also turn fat into energy, as it is also involved in fat metabo","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EGKIVJ0UQBEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYQ9Y0A#wasThisHelpful","R2EGKIVJ0UQBEJ","A2L73KNIMIF3TY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L73KNIMIF3TY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned a Vitamix for over a year but cleaning it is not easy task, specifically when you need to reach the bottom of the container and work your way around the blades. The residual buildup has been harder and harder to remove from the blades and around this area.I’ve read about some how-tos to remove buildup it by letting the Vitamix with white vinegar all night but the results were not satisfactory.I came across this special Vitamix wrench which I received few days ago. Here some tips on how to use that may be helpful.Removing the bottom of the Vitamix with it is quite simple but a bit tricky:- Turn the container upside down on top of a fabric.- Insert the wrench on the circular piece at the bottom of the Vitamix which will be facing you.- Unscrew it turning it counterclockwise.- After you remove it notice the blade piece there.- Tap gently on the blade piece several times with something non-metallic (I used the bottom of a wooden screwdriver).- The blade piece won't come down easily, at least on my case because it was the first time I remove it. Keep on tapping.- Eventually it will fall over the fabric you placed under the Vitamix earlier.Now finally you can really clean up your Vitamix.So I wonder, why this cheap wretch doesn’t come with a $500 blender?","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34KJ21T8HDMGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028Y4CVO#wasThisHelpful","R34KJ21T8HDMGY","A2L73KNIMIF3TY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L73KNIMIF3TY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Flaxseed provides many benefits for your health. Benefits of flaxseed, due to its Omega 3 content. Flax seed is most highest natural foods that contain Omega 3 among other foods, you only need 1 to 2 tbsp of it to meet daily requirement of Omega 3 (although I don't think it should be a replacement for fish based omega 3).Clinical studies suggest that flaxseed oil and other omega-3 fatty acids may be helpful in treating a variety of conditions.High cholesterolPeople who follow a Mediterranean diet tend to have an increased HDL, or ""good"" cholesterol level. The Mediterranean diet emphasizes fish and healthy fats, such as olive oil, and has a healthy balance between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Whole grains, root and green vegetables, daily portions of fruit, fish and poultry, olive and canola oils, and ALA (from flaxseed, flaxseed oil, and walnuts) are also part of the Mediterranean diet. Red meat and saturated fats are not part of the diet.However, whether taking flaxseed or flaxseed oil as a supplement can help lower cholesterol is up for debate. Some small studies show it has beneficial effects on cholesterol levels, but at least one double blind study found no evidence that it lowered cholesterol.Heart diseaseEating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts or legumes, and ALA rich foods may substantially reduce the recurrence of heart disease. One of the best ways to help prevent and treat heart disease is to eat a diet that is low in saturated and trans fat and rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (including omega-3 fatty acids from flaxseed and fish). Evidence suggests that people who eat an ALA rich diet are less likely to suffer a fatal heart attack. ALA may reduce heart disease risks through a variety of ways, including making platelets less “sticky,” reducing inflammation, promoting blood vessel health, and reducing risk of arrhythmia (irregular heart beat).Several human studies also suggest that diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids (including ALA) may lower blood pressure.However, it’s not clear whether taking flaxseed oil as a supplement would have the same effect on heart health.Sjogren’s syndromePreliminary evidence that suggests taking 1 - 2 g of flaxseed per day can improve the symptoms of dry eye in people with Sjogren’s syndrome. Sjogren’s syndrome is an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks glands in the body that produce moisture, like salivary and tear glands.CancerStudies suggest that flaxseed oil may help prevent the growth of breast tumors. In one Canadian Study, researchers discovered that flaxseed oil prevented breast tumor growth, likely through ALA content.

"I have finished my first bottle and I can notice any difference at all.Like many of you, I have purchased this product to help with joint pain (in my case elbows and shoulders).I used to take the joint products from Costco but I left them because they contain titanium dioxide and magnesium stearate (if you don't know what they problem with these substances are, Google titanium dioxide cancer).Anyway, I searched for a product that will not contain any toxic substances.I came across with this product and I decided to give it a try although I have never heard of the brand and there is very little literature about the brand on the internet.I tried the recommended dosage, but after 2 weeks I increased it by a factor of 2.

Each one of them can go from 60-85 in 5 degree increments. To me that is enough. The Low and High settings are a great idea because you can control how much electricity the unit will consume.We have had a tough winter in the Washington DC / Virginia area so I decided to purchase another one of these units.The two combined have allowed my central heating system to work less (consuming less of the high voltage the central system uses) while maintaining the most important areas of our home warm enough.The unit comes with a fan that helps circulating / distributing the heard evenly.In my opinion, the unit is a keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29ICSJH3CXCL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000M5PLYS#wasThisHelpful","R29ICSJH3CXCL9","A2L73KNIMIF3TY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L73KNIMIF3TY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Mineral Foundation website has published the ConcenTrace Analysis Summary. You may want to search the internet for this document: ""ConcenTrace Analysis 1 - The Mineral Foundation"".

The EPA has set a limit of 0.01 parts per million (ppm) for arsenic in drinking water.There is an interesting review here made by another customer where he recommends what would be the maximum number of drops to consume per serving of this product to stay under the EPA limit. While I respect everybody's opinion (and I appreciate the same in return), to me, any discussion of how much or less poison I should consume is out of any common sense.If any manufacturer is producing concentrated mineral drops, they should remove completely all arsenic (or any other toxin for that matter). Isn't health what we are all looking after all? The paradigm of get all of these benefits from consuming this product as well this poison is absurd and it doesn't justify consuming the product in the first place.Elemental arsenic and arsenic compounds are classified as ""toxic"" and ""dangerous for the environment"" in the European Union under directive 67/548/EEC.

When it comes to immune system Vitamin D3 is as important as Vitamin C and during winter time everybody seems to be deficient and they won't notice unless their doctors send them for a lab test.So in winter you may want to take Vitamin C along with Vitamin D3 and remember that your body will need some fatty food to be able to absorbe Vitamin D3 (nuts, cod oil, sardines, fish, etc).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23TQXMCRX42M2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OUMVO#wasThisHelpful","R23TQXMCRX42M2","A2L73KNIMIF3TY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L73KNIMIF3TY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using this product as a workout supplement, once or twice a day, before and after the gym.I don't think I have noticed any side effects, nothing that I can tell or may have noticed at all so I guess that is good.I take this supplement to boost energy and speed up recovery from exercise in addition to L-Canitine.Both give me a natural boost that will allow me to workout harder and longer.My recovery process is also faster.To make sure I provide an objective review, I also have to say that I'm taking regular multivitamins, Complex B, electrolytes, minerals and protein. The body's performance is not the result of only one product but the result of a well balanced diet. I think CoQ10 plays a key role within the diet.I normally take supplements or 3 weeks and take 1 week off.

"I decided to drop Gatorade and Powerade fundamentally because of their carcinogen dyes. If you don't know what I mean, Google ""Red 40 cancer"" and you will realize that what the FDA allows in this country is banned in most of other countries. Well, that is a different discussion and everybody is free to make its own decisions.I have been looking for a good replacement, I purchased and tried the Clif Shot Electrolyte Replacement Drink, Lemonade (check my review for details), but I made the mistake of not doing my ""homework"" before I placed the order. Sadly I found that Clif Shot is a bunch of salt and sugar with a tiny (really tiny) amount of potassium.See, if you are a serious athlete (runner, hiker, bicyclist, bodybuilder, etc.) your body needs more than salt and sugar.Only the lack of potassium will get you cramps and reduce your overall performance.It is not your body, it is the lack of these fundamental minerals.The basic electrolytes your body will need are these:- Sodium (Na+)- Potassium (K+)- Chloride (Cl-)- Calcium (Ca2+)- Magnesium (Mg2+)- Bicarbonate (HCO3-)- Phosphate (PO42-)- Sulfate (SO42-)After my initial fiasco, I visited a number of superstores and sport shops. In one of these visits I stopped by Whole Foods to check if they may have something.One of their guys recommended me to check the Vegan Sport Electrolyte Hydrator.To my surprise this is what I found (yes I agree with you, why these ingredients aren't listed in the Amazon's product description?):- Vitamin C:100%- Calcium: 20%- Phosphorous: 8%- Magnesium: 25%- Zinc: 7%- Selenium: 2%- Copper: 10%- Chromium: 17%- Chloride: 4%- Sodium: 4%- Potassium: 11%Thoughts and recommendations:1: Could have a little more of everything (except salt please). More potassium, that is a critical element for muscle contraction and performance.2: Mix it with lemonade or some juice, because water and this, not too tasty but nothing disgusting either.3: This is such a tiny container.4: It is by far the best combination of electrolytes that I have found (drop me a note if you know of anything better with the ""full spectrum"" of electrolytes).My overall experience with it is positive. I use it for long hikes with my lemonade and definitely keeps the cramps away and makes me perform better.I use it at the gym (I get a shot before and one after).

"I noticed this particular ingredient in the back of this product when I was going to purchase it at Costco: ""Carrageenan""I remember reading something negative about it so I Google it and I found a number of studies describing its toxicity and negative side effects.In summary: Promotes tumors, intestinal ulcerations and neoplasms and inflammatory bowel disease.45 publicly funded studies conclude that ""the potential role of carrageenan in the development of gastrointestinal malignancy and inflammatory bowel disease requires careful reconsideration of the advisability of its continued use as a food additive"".Please read it yourself, the NIH has listed several of these studies. This is one:==========================================================Review of Harmful Gastrointestinal Effects of Carrageenan in Animal ExperimentsJoanne K. TobacmanCollege of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USAIn this article I review the association between exposure to carrageenan and the occurrence of colonic ulcerations and gastrointestinal neoplasms in animal models.Although the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1982 identified sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of degraded carrageenan in animals to regard it as posing a carcinogenic risk to humans, carrageenan is still used widely as a thickener, stabilizer, and texturizer in a variety of processed foods prevalent in the Western diet.I reviewed experimental data pertaining to carrageenan's effects with particular attention to the occurrence of ulcerations and neoplasms in association with exposure to carrageenan. In addition, I reviewed from established sources mechanisms for production of degraded carrageenan from undegraded or native carrageenan and data with regard to carrageenan intake.Review of these data demonstrated that exposure to undegraded as well as to degraded carrageenan was associated with the occurrence of intestinal ulcerations and neoplasms. This association may be attributed to contamination of undegraded carrageenan by components of low molecular weight, spontaneous metabolism of undegraded carrageenan by acid hydrolysis under conditions of normal digestion, or the interactions with intestinal bacteria.Although in 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered restricting dietary carrageenan to an average molecular weight > 100,000, this resolution did not prevail, and no subsequent regulation has restricted use. Because of the acknowledged carcinogenic properties of degraded carrageenan in animal models and the cancer-promoting effects of undegraded carrageenan in experimental models, the widespread use of carrageenan in the Western diet should be reconsidered.Environ Health Perspect 109:983-994 (2001).==========================================================I contacted the vendor to inquire of this, below is their answer:==============================================Discussion Thread---------------------------------------------------------------Response Via Email (Nancy Bruland) - 10/02/2013 04:55 PMDear Al,Thank you for contacting Organic Valley.For quite some time we've been actively seeking to reformulate our cream, chocolate milk, eggnog and soy milks in order to eliminate the need for carrageenan. Our award-winning eggnog, for example, was carrageenan-free in time for the 2012 holiday season!  And as of September 2013, our half gallon and quart chocolate milk is also carrageenan-free, as well as our soy milk milk is not far behind (October, 2013) !  Please note that our traditionally pasteurized heavy whipping cream has always been produced without carrageenan.  We're working hard so that the small number of other products in our line that use carrageenan won't be far behind. [...]We want to let you know that we're working very hard on the reformulation process and that we've engaged this effort not only because consumers want simpler foods with less ingredients, but because it fits with our overall philosophy of producing food the most wholesome way possible.Thank you again for your comments. Please be assured that we hear you and hope to give you what you desire very soon!Sincerely,The Consumer Relations TeamCROPP CooperativeOrganic Valley/Organic Prairie Brands1-888-444-6455==============================================So I think there is hope and eventually this product will reach the quality level that organic consumers are expecting, however and until that happens, evidence tells us that the toxicity levels created by carrageenan make it extremely dangerous for consumption and in my opinion, irrational even thinking about giving it to your children.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IEF48KVMIRBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002FWTEYY#wasThisHelpful","R3IEF48KVMIRBD","A2L73KNIMIF3TY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L73KNIMIF3TY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Personally I find it annoying that I have to pay twice of regular raisins. It seems that if you want toxic, pesticide, fungicide and herbicide sprayed toxic food (so called regular or conventional) you have to pay a lot less. Although I can see an explanation, don’t you think that is odd?Well, besides my frustrations with the fluctuations in the organic/conventional market prices, I think these are good raisins but because of the organic label.

"Consumers need to learn to read the labels. I have read some reviews here where other consumers are attributing superhuman powers to drinking this product.Let’s begin with the basics. Electrolytes are fundamental to the body, yes we all agree on that one but they are more than just salt and a tiny bit of potassium. This is the list of most important electrolytes:- Sodium (Na+)- Potassium (K+)- Chloride (Cl-)- Calcium (Ca2+)- Magnesium (Mg2+)- Bicarbonate (HCO3-)- Phosphate (PO42-)- Sulfate (SO42-)If you read the label of the product you will realize that it contains Sodium (salt, which you can get almost anywhere), 50mg of Potassium (which is only 2% of what is required) and Magnesium (modest 2% of your daily needs, and a lot less if you are an athlete).To put the things in perspective, a banana gives you 422mg of Potassium, which is 844% more than one serving of this product. But still, 422mg of Potassium in a banana is nothing compared to the 4800mg required by an adult every day. See the point?Let me flip the coin: if you want to get 4800mg of Potassium to meet your daily Potassium needs you will need to take 96 servings of this product. That is two of these entire containers per day.On the magnesium side, a handful of nuts will give you 100% of your Magnesium daily needs.So where is the Chloride, Calcium, Bicarbonate, Phosphate, Sulfate and the rest of the Potassium and Magnesium? They are missing.In my opinion this product is just a bunch of sugar and salt with some lemonade flavoring. It is far from a real electrolyte mix like Vegan Sport Electrolyte Hydrator, which is way above.I’m staying away from sports drinks like Gatorade or Powerade because of the dyes they contain, specifically Red40, a well know and potent carcinogen. I like the fact that this product is made out of organic products but I certainly I do see its terrible lack of electrolytes.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21YCVWQ98EWU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HU7X0S#wasThisHelpful","R21YCVWQ98EWU5","A2L73KNIMIF3TY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L73KNIMIF3TY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have installed these on my truck last weekend.Really, it was a 1 hour project, all easy and great looking running boards, perfect if you have in your family children or anyone who may not be able to hop on without some help.The instructions as good, perhaps this one tip that may save you some head scratching. The long flat plastic piece has to be inserted into and along each one of the running boards and to that end; you need to remove one of running board's black plastic end. It is a cosmetic accessory.The rest is quite easy, you don't need any torque wrench or similar, just standard tools. I put as much force on mounting the screws as I put on removing them from under the vehicle.Use the provided screws and not the ones your removed from your vehicle. The ones that come with the running board are longer and will accommodate the increased depth of the mounting brackets over the original mounting points.The one thing I don't like from this running boards are that they go a bit too low. The original manufacturer's running boards are very close to they body, but in this case, the mounting brackets will place the running boards somewhere in between the ground and the truck's body. In my opinion too low but I guess I can live with it.The one thing I liked is that they look very nice, great finishing and the brackets give you the ability to move the running boards more towards de outside or perhaps one towards under the car for a more discrete looking.If you don't mind losing clearance, get them.If you mind losing clearance, look for something else.The picture is wrong, just eliminate the lights and that is what you will get.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SMUXK7SHJB3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BNXQK2#wasThisHelpful","R3SMUXK7SHJB3J","A2L73KNIMIF3TY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L73KNIMIF3TY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used this product, but no more. Like many of you, I used to be one of those consumers that never looked at the back of the box and thought that those ingredients should be OK. Well, that came to an end about a year ago. This is what you don't know about this product:CARCINOGEN #1: RED 40=====================Search the internet yourself, this is what you will find Red 40 causes:Behavior Issues:Some children may be particularly sensitive to artificial dyes, including Red 40, and for these children consuming this food coloring can increase behavioral issues and lead to hyperactivity, attention problems, irritability, learning problems, aggressiveness and restlessness. Eliminating these artificial colors from the diet of sensitive children may lower or eliminate their need for ADHD medications, according to a June 2008 article posted on CBSNews.DNA Damage:A number of tests have shown that Red 40 given to mice can damage their DNA, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Although some of the tests were negative, those involving the liver, colon and glandular stomach were positive. These results may not carry over to humans, but do show a potential harmful effect from consuming Red 40.Cancer:The Center for Science in the Public Interest notes that the tests done in the 1970s using mice were problematic and not conclusive as to the potential cancer risk of consuming Red 40. Compounds in Red 40 have been linked to cancer, according to Columbia University Medical Center, including 4-aminobiphenyl and benzidine. Tests have also found cancer-causing contaminants in this food coloring, including p-cresidine and aniline.CARCINOGEN #2: TITANIUM DIOXIDE===============================I have suffered from ear issues for years, ringing and dizziness. I didn't realize that my favorite chewing gums contained Titanium Dioxide, as well Colgate as well hundreds of other products. I, one by one, eliminated this substance from my diet (and family and children) and all my issues went away. This is what you will find in the internet about Titanium Dioxide.Titanium dioxide has recently been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen ''possibly carcinogen to humans''. Titanium dioxide accounts for 70% of the total production volume of pigments worldwide. It is widely used to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, plastics, papers, inks, foods, and toothpastes. It is also used in cosmetic and skin care products, and it is present in almost every sunblock, where it helps protect the skin from ultraviolet light.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IBY3KIU59GXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GZA7W0#wasThisHelpful","R1IBY3KIU59GXX","A2L73KNIMIF3TY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L73KNIMIF3TY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My overall impression with these car GPS mounts is rather pessimistic. I have tried replacements for Garmin, TomTom and SmartPhones. In all cases, I’ve got weak, crappy and low quality mounts or bulky, impractical and low quality ones.I’m glad to report that this particular mount is a nice exception. I have been using it for about 2 months, through the summer and it is holding nice and tight. Here some details:- Great iPhone Grip: It holds iPhone 4/5 without any problems, on the road and on the dirt. My previous experience with other holders is that some bumps in the road will cause the iPhone to go down. This one holds nice.- No shake: The structure of the holder is stiff and solid. It stays put.- Suction Cup: Nice design, it sticks to the windshield very nice. I have changed it few times from one vehicle to another and is still holding strong.- Size: It is not bulky and it is not small. I think the designed balanced the structure very accurately.- Assembling: Really a no brainer. One snap and one click and it is on.- Cost: at $16 bucks I think is money well spent. I you happen to planning on buying this and you have a cheaper hold in mind, please think carefully and read reviews. You may want to check my reviews, don’t buy the cheap holder I reviewed, that was money out the window (and lots of frustration).","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZLIOIGTVI99S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B78MT44#wasThisHelpful","RZLIOIGTVI99S","A2L73KNIMIF3TY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L73KNIMIF3TY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Malidoma Some was born into a village in Burkina Faso when it was still under French rule. He describes his first four years, focussing particularly on his close relationship with his grandfather, an elder and shaman. As he recalls his grandfather's funeral - spirit voices, and the dead man walking - I thought perhaps these were the confused recollections of a small child.At four, the author was 'stolen' by the local priest, and compelled to live in a Catholic boarding school. Forced to communicate in French, he soon forgot his native tongue. And Catholic dogma replaced tribal rites. But while he was persuaded by the religion, to the extent of wanting to become a priest, he was also repelled at the sexual and physical abuse he witnessed, and at the colonial attitudes towards the African people.At twenty he ran back to his village; much of the book now tells of (parts of) the month-long initiation ceremony he underwent. And here the reader must decide for himself what to make of the author's otherworldly experiences, as he enters other dimensions, communes with spirits and much more. Was he drugged? hypnotized? Was it Satanism or is there really a way into other universes? The descriptions are very vivid and persuasive, and I never realized initiation rituals included all this.Ultimately the author is urged by his elders to take his knowledge of two worlds and tell the white man who his people really are. ""Go and let yourself be swallowed. Your ancestors will do the rest.""An interesting work; make of it what you will.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UUDGOGOJOPFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140194967#wasThisHelpful","R3UUDGOGOJOPFH","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Drawn to visit the pygmies of the Central African Republic after hearing their music - ""a densely polyphonic sound...soft yodels...a sense of musical development"" - this is the account of Sarno's first encounter with the Ba-Benjelle tribe.He soon finds life with them very different to his expectations as ""they seemed intent only on milking me for all I was worth"". The Ba-Benjelle live close to a village, their life a combination of the forest and the worldly pleasures of shops: cigarettes, palm wine and marijuana. But Sarno manages to become a part of their group, recording numerous dances and shamanistic gatherings (although we presume the dancing spirits to be just men in costume, this is never clarified, the author himself admitting at one point that he was left ""staring in amazement, as flabbergasted as the villagers."")We also follow his visits into the rain forest, helping with hunting; and the diseases and insects that are a part of life. And Ngbali, the beautiful but enigmatic Be-Benjelle girl with whom the author has become smitten...An extremely well written and compelling book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ME58I10UFM0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0395613310#wasThisHelpful","R2ME58I10UFM0G","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An interesting account, published in 1836, by an American sailor about his experiences on his first ever journey on a whaling ship, bound for the Indian Ocean.After a shipwreck on a coral reef, they struggled to row to the nearest island - the largest of the Pelew (Palau) group, where their initial impressions of the natives were of fear and disgust for ""a people but one grade above the most ferocious beasts"".""To think of remaining with them to the end of life, or for any great length of time, was like the contemplation of imprisonment for life in the gloomy cells of a dungeon.""But the natives decided not to kill them; and our narrator even met an Englishman who had lived here some 29 years after fleeing his ship. He now was an elder and had no wish to go home. (Holden himself observes of the islanders that ""to the latest day of our lives we shall remember some of them with heartfelt respect and affection.)Still, catering for this group of Americans proved a drain on resources, and an attempt was made to build them a boat and help them sail away. And this is when they end up on the nearby - and very different - Lord North Island, ""one of the most horrible and wretched on the face of the globe""...Interesting to read of life in this part of the world in the early part of the 19th century.

"received free in exchange for reviewAs a keen handicrafter, I was absolutely thrilled with this set of crochet hooks.Presented in a clear plastic bag, the 9 hooks are supplied in a purple PVC zip case, in which they're secured by two durable looking black elastic straps. Wonderful to be able to have an almost complete set of sizes without losing them down side of sofa or in the back of my workbasket!Containing all the sizes from 2.0 to 6.0 mm, I love the fact each handle is a different colour. Firstly it's really cute, like a set of crayons(!) but secondly it's immediately quick and easy for the short-sighted crocheter (like me) to identify the size they need. Having said that, the sizing (engraved into the rubber handles) is a little unclear in the first instance, but once you know that you need purple, or whatever, you're away.I found the rubber handles easy to hold. And because the end of the hook is in normal shiny aluminium, you don't run into the problem that you get with colourede knitting needles, of coloured wool becoming 'invisible' on same shade needles.The shaping of the hook was great for catching stitches - there's a gradual taper of maybe 0.5 cm towards the actual hook - which helps beginners like myself not to lose them.In short an excellent purchase for any crocheter wanting the complete complement of sizes - and this is far cheaper than buying individual hooks as you need them at the local craft shop!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SV15M3R8R18Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016O51IAK#wasThisHelpful","R2SV15M3R8R18Z","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the world's funniest books, narrated by the priggish, self-satisfied, unattractive Augustus - acutely aware of others' failings, but ever on the alert to use them to his own advantage.Bashford's writing is superb, the language conveying such a vivid impression of the pompous character. Thus when his (equally pompous) father gets into an argument with their charwoman after dealing her son a blow (""dividing the integument of his forehead""), Augustus describes the woman's actions:""I beheld Mrs O'Flaherty thrusting my father's head into her pail. It was a commodious pail, very nearly full with incompletely clean water, and containing in addition the saturate garment with which it was her habit to wash the linoleum.""Augustus proves singularly unpopular at school, both with the boys he reports and with the masters through his demeanour:""When our form-master, a Mr Muglington, asked me if I knew the capital of Belgium, I replied that while I had not as yet enjoyed the opportunity of paying the town a personal visit, I had been credibly informed that it was known as Brussels, so indissolubly associated with the well-known brassica.""And meanwhile his proud, sternly Anglican father is - after a series of disagreements - transferring his worship from the Church of James the Less to that of James- the-Lesser-Still and ultimately James-the-Least-of-all. Mother is a poor cowed creature, her life spent serving her husband and son:""After every such exhibition of pristine vigour, however, my father experienced an acute reaction, and for many weeks would become a martyr not only to neurasthenic indigestion but to digestive neurasthenia accompanied by flatulence of the severest order. For months on end, indeed, my mother would be obliged to sit by his bedside in case he should wake up and require abdominal kneading.""The author was Hon Physician to King George VI, and entertaining ailments pepper the work, from his friend Simeon Whey's stutter (""kck"") to Charity and Understanding, but for whose ""slight impediments in their noses the whole house would have been wrapped in the profoundest stillness.""In short, a hilarious book - much funnier than the better known ""Diary of a Nobody"" - and one I would recommend to all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CKXZ0U4NGAAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140098577#wasThisHelpful","R1CKXZ0U4NGAAL","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have another book on this theme - but I have to say that Claire Scopes-Farrell has created a knitted tart shape to beat all others! So far I've made a tarte au citron (substituted the iced word with zigzaggy 'icing', which came out well.) Also a macaroon, which shape-wise is fab, but I did my own thing and unwisely substituted the author's suggested colour schemes for chocolate icing, which makes it look a little like a burger!

"Having read and enjoyed three of Edith Olivier's works, I pounced upon this biography in the library. The author introduces us to Edith's early life, as dutiful daughter of a stern Victorian clergyman, and after his demise as devoted sister.But it was after her sister's death, when Edith was fifty-one, that her life completely changed. 'Taken up' by well-to-do friends, Edith soon became centre of quite a salon of young notables. Cecil Beaton, Stephen Tennant, Siegfried Sassoon....and Rex Whistler.Aided in large part by Edith's diaries, the author charts the long relationship between the pair.:""At times (Edith) even sounds like Agatha in 'The Love Child'. Her ever-increasing protectiveness and adoration were at once romantic and maternal.""I felt Anna Thomasson did an excellent job of exploring the complexities of their friendship, and the outside influences that would sometimes take Rex away for a while. Throughout it all was the sanctuary of Edith's Wiltshire home, Daye House, but in the background the clouds of World War 2 were brewing...Fascinating read for all those interested in the lead characters - or indeed their 'set'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TOSZCY0YG6GF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLFVOLU#wasThisHelpful","R2TOSZCY0YG6GF","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started off thinking this would be a *3 bit of pleasant chick-lit, but it slowly descended to a *1 bit of total rot and I abandoned it on page 81.This is the tale of youngest daughter Tita, whom the horrible Mama Elena has 'sentenced' to look after her for the rest of her life, marrying off Tita's beloved, Pedro, to the girl's sister. Pedro goes along with this so he can be near Tita.Tita has an extraordinary aptitude for cookery - her recipes are intermingled with the story - and through food and meals he couple continue to share a romantic bond. Meanwhile in the background the revolution is going on...That's as far as I got, and if it sounds OK, I would just say the writing (or is it the translation?) is so feeble as to make it unreadable. The conversations are utterly stilted and improbable; the characters have no depth, it's just awful.

"An extremely compelling read: a diary by the eponymous doctor, a 34 year old who has never been with a woman. One day he is approached by Helga Gregorius, the lovely young wife of the grotesque elderly pastor. She seeks the Doctor's assistance in somehow avoiding the attentions of her husband which are repugnant to her - especially as she has a lover...As we read the Doctor's diary, we learn of his opinions - forward thinking for the time (1905) - on such matters as euthanasia and abortion, although he dismisses young woman who seek his help for the latter, thinking of his career. But there could be exceptions to the Doctor's professionalism: ""Morality is made for man, not man for morality; and it is to be used with discretion, taken 'with a pinch of salt'. It is prudence to adopt to the customs of one's surroundings; it is a folly to do so with conviction.""We read too of his loneliness, and the emptiness of his life, as the weeks roll past in a hot Stockholm summer...I read this in one sitting.

"An interesting book on an obscure country; the Australian author describes his experiences on a visit to Turkmenistan, and while details on hotels, transport and money changing are aimed at the actual traveller, he manages to create an entertaining work for the armchair traveller like myself too.A fairly short book, one can get an overview of history and recent events without getting bogged down in detail. I was fascinated by information on its being one of the last two Stalinist states left (along with N Korea) and - like N Korea - having leaders who go in for personality cults big-time.with vast marble statues everywhere (unbelievably this country is the world's biggest importer of Italian marble.) There are some hilarious sections on the outrageous and megalomaniac schemes of the president and his predecessor (including the 'Ruhnama', a 'Little Red Book' written by the latter, knowledge of which was part of driving tests and job interviews!)Also interesting to learn that the vast gas reserves mean free power for all, with the poorest farmers supplying heating to their animals in winter.The author visits the main places of interest including the ruins of Merv, once the largest city in the world, and the vast fiery crater at Derweze where 'gas was expected to burn out within days, yet 43 years later it is still burning brightly.'Accompanied by a few photos (though in b/w on a Kindle, and small in size, you'd probably be better off checking out these places on computer.)Not the most brilliant writing it has to be said: the book seems to come to a sudden halt. The author also provides a link to a piece by Paul Theroux on his own visit here, which is a very different calibre of writing.But there's not too many works on Turkmenistan available and I have to say I learned a lot and was entertained at the same time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RJDPOANYF817/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500271136#wasThisHelpful","R2RJDPOANYF817","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nobel prize winning author Wole Soyinka recalls his early years in 30s/40s Nigeria. Son of a middle class Christian family (his father is a headmaster), the flavour of Yoruba society is nonetheless vividly evoked throughout, whether it's his pagan grandfather cutting his ankles in a coming of age ritual, his father's ideas on bringing up his family (""to him, shoes on the feet of children was the ultimate gesture in the spoiling of the young""), the food ,the animals and the largely communal lifestyle of the people.Soyinka's early chapters show him as a very small child, just becoming aware of the world outside his home. I was reminded of the similar 'feel' that Laurie Lee conjured up in his recollections of infancy in 'Cider with Rosie' (albeit in a very different setting!) Later we see his early intelligence, and his attaining a scholarship. In the last couple of chapters the fairly tame Women's Group to which his mother belongs starts to take up politics, fighting the iniquitous tax levied on the poor and gradually becoming part of the anti-British rule movement.Extremely well-written with some amusing episodes, bringing his world to life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EWY5VH4NUH8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679725407#wasThisHelpful","R1EWY5VH4NUH8M","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is such a well-written and informative book, covering a period in history which many have barely heard of, if at all.Certainly I hadn't realised the vastness of the genocide: starting with massacres in the 1890s, the whole Turkish brutality continued until the 1920s, killing some 1.5 million Armenians. As the government moved away from an unstable sultan, and into the hands of the Young Turks, with their aim of creating a pure Turkish nation, we see the first 'ethnic cleansing'. Horrific killings, rapes and torture, alongside starvation and disease - interestingly witnessed (and largely condoned) by the German allies of Turkey in WWI - these would surely be the precursor to the later Jewish Holocaust. Many remaining Armenians were taken out in filthy railway cars and left to die in the Syrian desert...The author doesn't just focus on events in Turkey, however, but simultaneously considers the American response to these events. The huge response to the 1890s atrocities ""commenced what I believe can be called the modern era of American international human rights relief"". Led by missionaries, the Red Cross and money-raising efforts, this was succeeded by another massive effort in 1915 - this time more government led.Yet Balakian winds up by considering why it is that this horrific period in history has become largely forgotten - indeed denied by the Turkish perpetrators. Throughout the book he provides massive evidence for the genocide: not just from Armenian witnesses but politicians, missionaries, travellers who saw it - even Turks themselves, in secret letters of the time where government ordered the extermination of the race, or at the (spectacularly unsuccessful) post War trials. He looks at the importance of remaining on good terms with Turkey because of its position: near Russia and the Middle East, and how its threats whenever USA was about to acknowledge the genocide still cause it to back down. He even provides evidence that Turkey has paid professors in top American universities to help it 'sanitize its past.'An important and very readable work with a large bibliography and some b/w photos","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OWGK9LA5THUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060558709#wasThisHelpful","R3OWGK9LA5THUB","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Read during a global reading challenge (one of the few books set in Guinea Bissau I could find). this is a very readable and interesting historical work that reads in part like an adventure story.This is the account of the 1792 voyage by a group of mainly English people with the aim of founding a colony on Bolama, an island off the Bissau coast. Their motives were various, but were led by a desire to help end slavery - by proving that Africans could be used as paid labour with no need for enslavement. And if that sounds rather naive, the whole endeavour is soon shown to be dogged with disaster: violent tribes, endless rain, disputes...and disease.But the most important result of their attempt was their ultimate carrying of a particularly virulent strain of yellow fever to the Caribbean, and thence to America and Europe. The independence of Haiti, Billy Smith argues, came about thanks to the 'Hankey' and its fatal infection of the European soldiers who were attempting to suppress the (largely immune) Africans. And Napoleon's decision to sell his US territory was a follow-on from his loss of Haiti - with a massive impact on American power.As the author concludes: ""Seemingly insignificant events, like the beating of the wings of a butterfly (or a mosquito) can have enormous consequences half a globe away..""","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRWAJ9KURJVJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300194528#wasThisHelpful","RRWAJ9KURJVJ3","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the Philippines' epic novel, which exposes the corruption of the Spanish colonists - specifically the Catholic church - and which led to its author being shot by firing squad aged just thirty-five,OK, that's the background. I wasn't sure what to expect from Philippino literature, but it's written very much in the mode of European Victorian classics (although obviously one takes in the Asian background: a fete champetre for the well to do young people ends in a crocodile being caught; there's cockfighting, big Catholic parades ...).The story hinges on Ibarra, a middle-class young man, just returned from Spain, to find his beloved father has been jailed and is now dead. He intends to marry his lovely fiancee Maria-Clara, and build a school for the locals.But we soon become aware of the cruel local friars, whether it's pallid Father Salvi casting lecherous looks at Maria, or the evil Father Damaso.Although the good characters are a little one-dimensional, Rizal also conjures up some great comic personalities: Sister Rufa boasting about the hundreds of 'plenary indulgences' she has accumulated and keeps note of in an account book; Dona Victorina who affects a lisp to sound 'Andalusian' (and hence better class.)I have to say this wasn't the greatest book I've ever read. More than once I kind of lost the thread (and admit to having to resort to the Wikipedia summary of the novel to check if two characters had died or not.)

Finnish is an incredibly difficult language to begin with, and this book, with its total emphasis on grammar, instructions from page 1 that you learn 4 forms of each word, lack of everyday conversational situations etc is not going to help you.

"A very strange novella, and one where in retrospect I think the reader actually benefits from having read spoilers as to what's going on, otherwise it all seems too weird and Kafka-esque for words for the first half. Our narrator, an unnamed Venezuelan, on the run from jail or death, has fled to an uninhabited island in the Ellice Archipelago.This is a strange and horrible island: there's a museum, chapel and swimming pool. There's awful and unpredictable tides, and unidentifiable machines in the basement. The narrator comments on how hard the trees are; how he thinks he can't see the skylight and has to go and check it's still there (later on you see where this was leading.) One day he finds a large group of people have arrived and taken over the museum, although he never saw a ship. In terror of discovery at first, he soon falls for gypsy-like Faustine.....The preface describes this as an adventure story, which you eventually find it is.

"An extremely readable work (though I found it dragged a little towards the end, as illegal dealings and fictional meetings with the President occupy the storyline).Narrated by the eponymous 'hero', who tells us at the outset of his being numbered ""one of Africa's most corrupt men, a cheat of monstrous and reptilian cunning.""Two strands run alongside - primarily his earlier life in Kenya, but also his experiences now in Canada.Vikram Lall starts his account by recalling his childhood in Nairobi, where he and his sister occupy a middle position in society, not quite able to mix with the 'European' elite, yet far above that of the black Kenyans. His playmates include kids of both groups - the white Bruce siblings and Kenyan lad Njoroge, who dreams of Jomo Kenyatta's leading his people to freedom. For this is the terrifying era of the Mau-Mau...(Incidentally, good though it was, I must take issue with the review by Janette Turner Hospital on inside cover, describing it as ""in a category with Tolstoy's 'War and Peace'."" That's something of an exaggeration!)Later on, with Kenyan independence, Lall still finds himself in an in-between world; society has been turned on its head, with the Black population now in charge.A family saga, an account of how corruption occurs, a story of terrible sadness, set in a country I knew little about.(Incidentally, good though it is,  I must take issue with the review by Janette Turner Hospital, reproduced on inside cover, which describes the book as ""belonging in a category with Tolstoy's 'War and Peace'.

"Until reading this work, I had never thought of how Stalin's policies impinged on the nomadic peoples of Central Asia. In this memoir, written by the son of a traditional Kazakh herding 'aul' (community), we follow his life from childhood in the 20s - a life of migration, of clan solidarity and traditional ways, to Stalin's disastrous enforced collectivisation in the early 30s. With a combination of corruption, ill-management and and drought, there was a mass famine, which the author only survived by the skin of his teeth.""Three years earlier, my mother had ridden a white horse along this same route, sitting astride her silver-edged saddle studded with precious gems, with a child in a travel-cradle fastened to the front of her swaddle, leading a camel by a long rein attached to her left wrist. It was impossible to know what she was thinking now as she traipsed along in a state of semi-starvation.""He writes of being banned from school as the son of a 'kulyk' (wealthy peasant), of homelessness, of the freezing winters ...and at last of the onset of World War 2. We know he went on to do well in his chosen career of teaching, becoming a headmaster, and living into old age (this book was written in early 2000s.)As another reviewer states, this is a 'flat', factual recounting of events, rather than an emotional or literary work, but informative, covering a place about which we hear little in the West. The introduction tells us that only ""a fragment - perhaps some 5% of the stock-rearing population - has to this day survived.""Several pages of b/w photos.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ARJWKF3K6YA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1585679550#wasThisHelpful","R21ARJWKF3K6YA","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He vividly conjures up a sense of place: the heat, the Mediterranean, the street he lives in. But this is the era of repression under Gadaafi, and young Suleiman's wealthy businessman father is involved in the resistance.He is aware - but not fully comprehending - of people being 'taken away', tapped phone calls, televised interrogations and hangings, the home being under constant surveillance; and of the effect this is having on his mother, who mysteriously becomes 'ill' whenever his father is away (we soon learn this is thanks to alcohol which she procures illegally.)The world around him, the half-truths with which adults try to shield him from the reality, starts to brutalize the child too...A powerful read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GAND87TJW9GZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385340435#wasThisHelpful","R1GAND87TJW9GZ","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchased after receiving promotional email from authorMost books whose authors solicit reviews are nothing special. This, on the other hand, is a work not to be missed - I was laughing out loud through most of it.Narrated by one Eddie Beasley, who prefers the name Pomeroy as it has 'class, style and strut', it follows his escapades after getting out of jail. A trip to Oakland leads to him getting mixed up with a load of protesters - but Pomeroy's preoccupations throughout are women and releasing a record. (""Hell, a f***er can't do concerts if he's stuck in Guantanamo Bay. The place is fulla Arabs who don't listen to nothin' but lutes"".) Nonetheless, he gets caught up in a number of incidents, including taking control of a ferry, attacking a few cops with his guitar and meeting a feminist girl band - presumably based on 'Pussy Riot' - in Paris.Pomeroy's comments on his prowess with the opposite sex are constant and lurid (though entirely in his dreams), and he tends to refer to himself in the third person (""Hell, I wouldn't kick ol' Hillary outta bed even if she does have thick ankles. Pomeroy likes 'em feisty."")Very very funny indeed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY3OZW4HDDZ9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PKEQYHO#wasThisHelpful","RY3OZW4HDDZ9P","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Veronika is a young Slovenian woman, attempting suicide. She's not ill or depressed; only, she's realised her life is unremittingly the same every day, and she's going to get old and go downhill. Also, she's powerless to do anything about the bad things going on in the world. Of course, her attempt is unsuccessful and she finds herself in a psychiatric hospital...In the hospital we encounter various other characters, notably schizophrenic Edward, 'The Fraternity', a group who are cured but don't want to leave as they can behave how they want if they're deemed 'mad'. And Dr Igor, who is pursuing a theory on bitterness (or 'Vitriol'), which seems to infect most people...I so disliked this book: it's probably more of a *1.5. I realise that the whole plot and characters are meant to illustrate Coelho's thoughts rather than being believable real-life persons.

"downloaded free after author emailed me for a reviewThis is a horrifying story, telling the story of Bucharest's homeless street children. The author, himself one of them, describes the brutality of the orphanage, with its sadistic staff.Later the little group find themselves living beneath the streets of Bucharest in ""a quagmire that people call 'The city of the living dead' made out of intricate subway tunnels...where homeless children...sleep among steaming wet pipes that shields them from the cold outside.""Despised and ignored by the population, living by their wits in a city of violent militia, we see the effects of their experiences, notably the craving for revenge by some:""Make no mistake! We are at war! They are out to kill us with their indifference towards us! They're killing children...""And they certainly do, with only a few of the original crowd making it throughBut also the basic desire for the things ordinary kids have: when they manage to acquire their files, one of them exclaims ""Birthdays! We have birthdays! All of us, not just the rich kids!""The very subject matter made this quite a compulsive read, although sometimes the constant violence makes one lose track of who's doing what (and query whether it happened QUITE like that.) The author's English isn't the best although I didn't find it really spoilt the story. A very intense read: possibly the fairly large cast of characters means that - apart from Daniel and Vlad - we don't really get to know the others and consequently while we empathise with them they remain largely strangers.An important story that needs telling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R325TKG81LBHTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBU7I66#wasThisHelpful","R325TKG81LBHTT","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Utterly enjoyable read, following a group of people living in Trinidad, their lives following the 'predictable, almost necessary cycle of burgeoning and disappointment, hubris and humiliation, that all humans are subject to in Shiva Naipaul's scheme of things' (Amit Chaudhuri).The work centres on the vain and irascible Egbert Ramsaran, who has raised himself from a prospective future in the cane-fields to become the richest man in town. We meet his colourless wife Rani, who spends her days off with her stamp collection, and their son Wilbert, intended to take over the business. And illegitimate son, Singh, lurking in the background, a disconsolate character...Then there is Egbert's one-time friend, now a 'family man' if not a lawyer as he once hoped, father to studious and rather self-satisfied Julian, planning to become a doctor.And lastly Sushila, a woman with a dubious past, ""infatuated to the point of obsession with adornment"", and her quiet, self-contained, fatherless daughter Sita.The interweaving of their lives, their plans, their hopes, their feelings, all prove to be as pointless as the gatherers of chip-chip, a minuscule shellfish; like them ""they were not deterred by the disproportion between their labours and their gains. Rather, the very meagreness of their reward seemed to spur them on.""I have enjoyed both of Shiva Naipaul's novels (this and 'Fireflies') and can't recommend him enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36KTJA9S90BR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0141197226#wasThisHelpful","R36KTJA9S90BR7","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An extremely well-written account of an event of which I certainly was unaware - namely the appalling treatment of the native peoples of German S W Africa (now Namibia) in the early years of the 20th century. Based on the Kaiser's desire to create 'lebensraum' - space for the Aryan race to flourish, separate from the 'natives' - the German colonists created horrific concentration camps, notably that of Shark Island, near Luderitz.But the author's don't confine themselves to relating African history; after explaining the German situation from WW1 to the disintegration of the country in its wake, and the rise of the Third Reich, they go on to draw parallels between the racial discrimination that was used to justify the treatment of natives in Africa, and that later used against Slavs and Jews.""So much of what took place in German SW Africa at the beginning of the twentieth century horribly prefigures the events of the 1940s: concentration camps, the bureaucratisation of killing, meticulous record-keeping of death tolls and death rates, the use of work as a means of extermination, civilians transported in cattle trucks then worked to death, their remains experimented upon by race scientists, and the identification of ethnic groups who had a future of slaves and those who had no future of any sort.""A shocking book, yet written in a very readable style, and I learned so much, both about African and European history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVCLO4Y6I9AVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045I7FZ6#wasThisHelpful","RVCLO4Y6I9AVU","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The novel opens when she is a girl, living in Colchester - the daughter of King Coel.

Helena discovers Christianity and makes it her mission to go to Jerusalem to find the true Cross, but this is in no sense a preachy book - the aged relic-hunter Helena is a breezy, determined character.Interesting (put me somewhat in mind of Robert Graves' 'I Claudius' trilogy) but with comic moments too","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T70229JRD8SH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316216518#wasThisHelpful","R2T70229JRD8SH","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"free gift in exchange for reviewI had never before purchased an oil diffuser, having visions of tea-lights and fire risks.But this is a lovely safe item, and so easy to use. (If it runs out of water it turns itself off so you don't have to worry about it 'boiling dry'.)We added around 60 ml water to the water tank using measuring cup, then just a couple of drops of essential oil (I had some lavender oil lying around, which I'd already diluted with olive oil - but it's giving off a beautiful fragrance, which I can smell at other end of room.) At that rate it's going to be pretty economical to use. (Note: when not using you should empty out remaining water and allow to air dry to prevent bacteria.)Just put cover on tank, plug in lead, and hey presto it starts emitting fragrant vapour immediately (no 'warming up' period.) There are 4 levels of mist available - just press the 'mist' button and it goes up from one level to the next.It's not particularly a thing of beauty when you look at the white plastic structure, but of course this is all illuminated by an LED light which you can either have gently changing from one colour to another or can set it to one colour only.I really love it and am going to get some more exciting essential oils!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K891Y7O4BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEB07W2#wasThisHelpful","R3K891Y7O4BY","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A beautiful little book - one wants to pigeonhole it as 'biography' (of his mother), but it's much more a work of literature than that.Barrie looks back on his life in Scotland, with his numerous siblings - though all but two remain nameless - and his parents. His father is barely mentioned, for it is his mother who seems to have been the centre of the author's life.In early chapters we see the heartbreak she went through on the death of Barrie's elder brother, while away at school:""I heard a listless voice that had never been listless before say 'Is that you?' I think the tone hurt me, for I made no answer, and then the voice said more anxiously 'Is that you?' again.

Then I heard a cry, and my mother turned in bed, and though it was dark I knew that she was holding out her arms.""But Mother is not just a tragic or saintly character, for Barrie brings out in full her humorous character, whether devouring works by his rival, RL Stevenson (covertly - ""you must remember that she only read it to persuade herself (and me) of its unworthiness, and that the reason she wanted to read the others was to get further proof."") or in her refusal to stay in bed when ill.Both beautiful and gently amusing, I found this a book that grew on me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H6X3LRUPN95A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480241679#wasThisHelpful","R1H6X3LRUPN95A","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A wonderful novel, focussing on a winter three years before the death of author Thomas Hardy. Unhappily married to a depressed, rather neurotic woman much younger than him, Hardy becomes charmed with local girl Gertrude Bugler. She is part of the local amateur dramatic group, where Hardy meets her in their performance of 'Tess'. As he plans to help her get the lead role when the play is put on in London, his wife, Florence, is becoming obsessively jealous...Nicholson tells the story in chapters narrated alternately by Florence, Gertrude and by an all-knowing narrator, who can describe Hardy's thoughts and imaginings. There are vivid, Hardy-esque descriptions of the countryside and the old-fashioned house - which he loves but which Florence does not. And the thoughts of the 84 year old as he ponders his imminent demise, his final chance of happiness, are very moving and convincing.I absolutely loved this book and recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBWFU2OBKMUDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0007516088#wasThisHelpful","RBWFU2OBKMUDU","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My favourite of these three tales of the awfulness of Russian family life was the first (the longest at 110 p) - 'The Time is Night'. Narrated by a harried 50 year old single mother, she tells of her problematic son, newly released from jail and demanding money for drink; her daughter, three times pregnant by different men, and who has dumped her eldest son, Tima, on her mother - an added expense and worry, yet a joy too:""My love. It's a physical pleasure for me to hold his weightless little arm, to gaze into his round blue eyes, with eyelashes so long that even when he sleeps they cast shadows like enormous fans. All parents, and especially grandparents, love little children with a physical, sinful love.""Her difficult life, scraping by, barely able to feed them, is exacerbated when her aged mother, senile and in hospital, is ordered to be sent to an insane asylum, thus curtailing the pension they rely on to live...Very movingly written in a style all her own, showing human feeling in a very harsh world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SF00E6UWZTUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143121669#wasThisHelpful","R3SF00E6UWZTUS","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an absolutely charming light read which will have you booking a holiday to Croatia.Written in 1935 it is the story of well-to-do artist Grace Kilmichael who is 'running away' from her family to decide what to do next. Her economist husband seems to belittle her and her work (and perhaps to be getting overly friendly with a female colleague) while her 19 year old daughter Linnet is starting to belittle her too. As the author observes:""Tenuous, elusive but tenacious, this tradition of inferiority persists - subtly imposed by the husbands; tacitly and often unconsciously acquiesced in by the wives. Their views, somehow, are worth less than men's; the moral initative has passed from them; in some strange way - whether consciously or not - they are subordinate. Now this subjection was tiresome and fatiguing enough while it was subjection to one person only, the husband, but for Lady Kilmichael's generation it had suddenly become subjection to their children as well, and when it reached that stage it became insupportable.""So our heroine makes her way to Venice and thence to the Dalmatian coast (Croatia) (the Virago edition has a helpful map at the front showing the places, many of which have changed names since the book was published.) While painting, wandering round ancient buildings and taking in the beautiful scenery she meets up with a young man, Nicholas, deeply unhappy at his father's insistence that he abandon his beloved painting for a 'proper' career in architecture. The two of them spend some sublime - and innocent - weeks in Illyria, and Lady K starts to 'find herself'...Ann Bridge's descriptions of the country are quite exquisite - hills covered in irises, obliging and picturesque locals, wonderful little restaurants. Somehow I couldn't massively warm to Nicholas: perhaps it was his slight grumpiness, or maybe his gastric problems (""my tummy"") . The author has a serious message about the true nature of freedom, but expect a rather convenient ending. I could imagine this making a 1930s movie.Probably more 3.5 than 4 *.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FEDD76BYW4VN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APDW3Y8#wasThisHelpful","R2FEDD76BYW4VN","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is from: The Butcher Boy: Picador Classic (Paperback)Narrated by the seriously disturbed - yet curiously empathetic - Francie Brady, as he recalls his youth: ""When I was a young lad twenty or thirty or forty years ago I lived in a small town where they were all after me on account of what I done on Mrs Nugent.""The narrative covers around four years, during which time Francie's dysfunctional family life (mother having a breakdown, father a drunk) completely comes to an end. The only stability in his life is his friend Joe - their friendship harks back to an innocent time. But Joe is turning away from Francie's extreme behaviour; growing up, no longer interested in comic books. Worse, he is hanging out with middle class Philip Nugent, on whose family - most particularly his mother - Francie's mind has come round to pinning all his woes.Strange, delusional yet extremely compelling read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYJ2EARFCZ1W2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4403FM#wasThisHelpful","RYJ2EARFCZ1W2","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this after a visit to Pamplona, where Hemingway is a Big Name. I hadn't been too struck on previous works of his, so began dubiously.This novel is narrated by one Jake Barnes, a young American, and his 'gang' of friends, notably Lady Brett Ashley and her hard-drinking fiance. These 'bright young things' have been damaged by WW1 - Jake (like just about all the men) is in love with Brett, but has been rendered impotent. She, meanwhile, seems emotionally scarred: we learn in a conversation that her true love died during the War, while she served as a V.A.D. in a hospital.Opening in Paris, where life is one round of alcoholic nights out and - for Brett - a succession of meaningless assignations with men - the group move off to take in Pamplona for some fishing and the annual fiesta and bullfights. I got quite caught up in the book at this point, thinking I knew what was going to happen to this little group of people among whom passions were aroused, echoing the descriptions of the bullfights (I was totally wrong!)A book that grew on me, despite having a largely unlikeable cast of characters. Hemingway brings the atmosphere of Spain to life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ASHVULU0NL1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743297334#wasThisHelpful","R3ASHVULU0NL1I","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Published in 1968, this is a remarkable account of one woman's trek of over 1000 miles through Ethiopia. Accompanied only by her trusty mule, Jock, she tells of their adventures crossing the inhospitable terrain: ascending mountains, swimming across rivers, and the swamps and jungle around Lake Tana. The narrative, of course, is brought to life by her dealings with local people whom she encounters on the way, often sleeping in their compounds. She writes of the poverty, the bugs and disease; but also the interesting and amusing situations she encounters; and the dangers from hostile 'shiftas' (bandits.) And she describes beautiful scenery and magical moments.The author's sense of humour shines out in her writing, at herself as much as the Ethiopians.Rather less 'political' than her later work on Laos.One finishes the book full of admiration for a colossal achievement by a solitary traveller, unfazed by the injuries and difficulties she suffers in this remote and impoverished country.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BTYGMGX4P1DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906011672#wasThisHelpful","R1BTYGMGX4P1DA","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"received free sample in exchange for reviewI fully admit to being a non-scientific type - my old alarm clock has hands, and not a 'setting' in sight, so I roped in hubby to help evaluate this product.It's a nice, modern looking clock (15 x 6 cm - 4.5 cm thick) which arrived well presented in a box with a USB lead. I managed to find the power- on button on back, and it immediately lit up and started beeping at me. Fear not - it only does this for a couple of seconds to tell you it's on!Hubby then came over and after much fiddling got the time set up. The manual explains this, although I wouldn't have wanted to suss it out unaided. Similarly with the date. There's also a temperature function, but as I sit here shivering in a jumper I'm highly dubious about the ""23.1 degree"" temperature that the clock claims. (Note: the manual's 'cautions and warnings' advise that this is ""not a professional thermometer...maybe error occurred...please using the thermometer if you need the accurate temperature"" (sic). ) In clock's favour, all these features are visible on the screen - you don't have to press any buttons to bring up the date etc.The clock is billed as 'the first intelligent alarm clock with lithium battery in the world' and it certainly is handy to be able to recharge it using the USB lead (which fits into small hole in back.)I was also quite intrigued by the fact that clock has 5 or 7 day setting - thus automatically not waking you up on weekends! A new feature to me, who has to re-set her old-style clock every night!One thing I don't like is the fact that if you're using it AS AN ORDINARY CLOCK - ie you want to glance over at it from time to time to check the time - the black digits barely stand out against the dark grey background and it's pretty unreadable from any distance (see photo) . (There is a snooze/ light button which illuminates it, but that only lasts for a few seconds.)In short, a perfectly sound product; hubby agreed it was 'fiddly' but if you're moderately au fait with things technical it may suit you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZXBTMDNLA0V2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S9A7YPM#wasThisHelpful","RZXBTMDNLA0V2","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Published in 1955, this is the account of the author's time spent in the Philippines just after the War, along with her husband, who worked for forestry and agriculture. She was already well-known for her previous books on their time in Malaysia (the latter, 'Three came Home', tells of their time in a Japanese camp, along with toddler son George.)As this book opens, George is a boisterous 12 year old, and the family are settling into a colonial house, with a 'barrio' (shanty town) next door; George is soon befriending local lads and bringing animals home. But this is not just an entertaining family saga, as Ms Keith describes (quite readably) the political situation, with a new 'man of the people' president, at last opening the presidential palace to the common people (hence the title) and seeking to stop the corruption.She also describes a visit she and her husband make to Japan, and the awkwardness between the two sides, associating shortly after the terrible events of just a few years ago.:""In time he (customs officer) finds a stamp on the old passport...of Batu Lintang Prison Camp. He looks up quickly, meets Harry's eyes, and they both smile. The lad says hastily 'Ha, war is over now!' and chops the passports and hands them back.""Illustrated by the author with entertaining little b/w line drawings.I found this a fairly interesting read, although some of the political stuff in the latter half is somewhat dated and irrelevant now to the casual reader.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14W3RP93N2B6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0708900720#wasThisHelpful","R14W3RP93N2B6M","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Autobiography, where the author revisits her childhood; as daughter of a Sierra Leone doctor and his Scottish wife, life becomes highly dangerous when her father becomes involved in politics. She recalls moving between her middle class African life and living in a caravan in Scotland. But while her father rises in the ranks of Sierra Leone government, his party overthrowing the corrupt ruling one, it's not long before his former colleagues become even more corrupt....The latter quarter or so of this work is taken up by the author returning to her country to attempt to decipher the lies and violence that surrounded her father's death, in an anarchic and utterly corrupt regime.Very moving and informative work.

"The Sandinistas and the Contras were just words to me, and I wondered whether this autobiography of a woman who became a Nicaraguan revolutionary would be readable. Well, it certainly is: the author's account of her fascinating life - from privileged daughter of a well-to-do family to an increasing awareness of the horrors of the Somoza regime. As she becomes a member of the illegal Sandinistas, she tells of the passionate commitment to the cause, that ended up taking her away from her children for long spells. Of the friendships and love affairs with her colleagues, and the tragedies of the endless deaths and tortures at the hands of the regime.As the Sandinistas finally gain victory, Belli writes movingly:""Overcome with joy, we fell into one another's arms...I don't know who began crying first...but suddenly the tiny apartment was filled with wails and sobs. Alfredo and I looked in each other's eyes, remembering the dinners in Mazatlan with Marcos.I saw Ricardo in the inky twilight at the Poet's house, Pin and his thick eyeglasses, Arnoldo's smile as he left my house, Camilo talking to me about Woodstock...""But life in Nicaragua remains difficult as the USA supports the expelled Somoza regime, and the Sandinista leaders begin arguing among themselves and losing their revolutionary ideals.Very interesting and highly readable work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HP6XCRZTBWVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400032164#wasThisHelpful","R1HP6XCRZTBWVX","AMOUCAFH0MKJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMOUCAFH0MKJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I broke my vibrator the other day.Well, actually my husband broke it.No, that’s not true either. The guy who came to put the new carpet in broke it.He found it under the bed and got the wire caught and somehow broke the wire pulling on it. (At least that’s how we think it happened).But then the next time somebody used it they got a shock and when I went out to the kitchen it was on the counter all taken apart, it’s little guts splayed open and it’s wires spread all around.“What’s “Fred” doing on the kitchen counter?” I asked, or rather, shouted at my husband at the sight of seeing my little guy all opened up like that.“I’m going to fix him.” he said.“But, David, it’ll take you days and days to fix him.”“No it won’t. I promise.”“Yes, it will. I don’t want to wait.”“Well you don’t have a lot of options,” he said. “That’s a very special vibrator.”(Gotta love a guy who has respect for his wife’s vibrator).“I know it is. I’m going to order a new one from Amazon. They have everything.”I’d had Fred for almost 20 years, having bought him in a “women’s specialty shop” in Berkeley, California where a lesbian girlfriend of mine had suggested I go—adding that a then almost 60 year old woman like me wouldn’t be embarrassed to buy her first vibrator there.“They’ll understand,” she’d said, ever so patronizingly.When I went in, I told the guy behind the counter with the stocking cap, goatee, and pierced eyebrows that I was looking for a vibrator, that I’d never had one and what could he tell me about the ones they carried.Turned out he was a really well-informed employee as he definitely asked all the right questions.“Rechargeable battery?” (“Nice option.”)“For you to use alone or with someone else?” (“Both.”)“Underwater?”  (“Underwater? Really?”)“Large wand or small hand held?” (“Show me.”)I picked out the biggest, strongest, most expensive vibrator in the store. The stocking-cap-guy rang it up and I nonchalantly handed him my credit-card as if it meant nothing to me that there was a pair of crotchless panties in the display stand right next to the cash register.He put my new purchase into a nice pink bag and as I carried it outside to where I was parked, I swear, it came alive in my hand. I made a u-turn and immediately headed back to my hotel to try it out.They say you always remember your first love.I had no idea what a wonderful thing a real vibrator could be. I’d been using something else for years without realizing exactly how limiting it was.Don’t get me wrong. It was pretty innovative of me to have even thought of using the flat side of an electric toothbrush to begin with, not to mention brave of me to have tried such a small pointy thing on such a small not-so-pointy part of my anatomy and it was a big step for me to accept that my orgasms were worth $68.00,“A true sign of self-love and sexual self-esteem.” It said so right in the brochure.Today, I still love my big, sleek, shiny, vibrator with its soft/firm rubber knob on the end that moves and twirls and well—vibrates. It never gets tired or stops too soon, doesn’t sit in bars making jokes about the way I smell and doesn’t compare its size to other vibrators. It doesn’t even pretend to understand the words “blow” and “job,” is always ready when I am, and always stays awake.What’s not to love?“I need to introduce you to somebody,” I said to David the first time he got into my bed and, reaching around behind me pulled Fred out from between the pillows.“Well, hello Fred,” my incredibly game husband said. “I think we’re all going to have a really good time together!”Back in the kitchen where my now broken Fred was so sadly laying on the counter, I ran over to the computer and found that in fact Amazon did have an exact replacement.“Look at that, David. They have it”!  And, it could be delivered within two days.“How much is it?” he said.“Who the hell cares,” I said.“Order it,” he said.And I did.Epilogue: When the new vibrator came, David said that we’d have to change its name. I told him no, we didn’t have to change its name.  It was like the Kings of England. “Oh,” he said, “Like Fred the 1st and Fred the 2nd?”“Yes.” I said. “Just like that. He’s Fred the 2nd.”(This review was published on http://www.elephantjournal.com/ in exactly the same form - it was not solicited by me.  It is a true story).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VVW4XNCCE2YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQRZCFG#wasThisHelpful","R1VVW4XNCCE2YI","A2VFJIJVORI15O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VFJIJVORI15O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I HATE to wash my hair.  I mean, I hate it.  I have a lot of very fine hair.  Very thick and wavy, but fine.  It takes about 45 minutes to dry it and because it is so fine and (did I mention) dry (oh, and how about damaged from coloring) it gets frizzy frizzy frizzy.  This is of course not helped by the fact that I live in Arizona where the air itself is dry and frizzy!  Anyways - all that has changed since I used this wonderful product.  I had read a review in the NY Times about co-shampoos in general and thought maybe I would like them.  Then I came on here and checked out the reviews and after reading quite a few on quite a few different brands bought this one.  Look!  Five stars!  After only ONE shampoo (co-shampoo?) everything I hated about washing my hair changed.  I could tell the minute I started drying it that there was a difference.  First of all - it took less than half the time to dry!  I figure all that time I spent before was spent on drying the detergent that was in my hair - not on drying my actual hair.  Second of all, this product actually enhanced my waves - making them luscious and almost even curly -- soooo easy to style.  Just shake and bake!  Also it left my hair very, very shiny.  And NO FRIZZ.  I was concerned that the softness that people mentioned in their reviews meant ""lank"" - but it doesn't.  My hair is actually soft AND thick AND wavy/curly AND shiny AND not frizzy AND I LOVE IT!!!  Boy am I sold.  I am also very impressed with the price on this particular product as compared to others.  Yes.  It does have a coconut smell coming out of the jar - but I didn't notice it once I put a towel around my head.

"I am a 100% Italian/American woman.  That means, over the course of my 70+ years I have used a lot of garlic.  I have never had a garlic ""press"" and decided to get one because, frankly, I was sick of peeling, smashing, and chopping garlic - not to mention having my hands smelling like garlic forever, having to be sure to wash the chopping block so the apples didn't taste like garlic, etc. etc. etc.  Anyways - when I recently made a recipe (African stew, not Italian) that called for 9 cloves of garlic, I gave up and decided to order a garlic press.  I went to Amazon and -- long story short, after reading all the positive reviews ordered the ""Propresser Garlic Press.""Long story short.  I don't like it.  :(  But let me tell you why.1)  Once I have placed a garlic clove inside the press, the grip becomes too wide for me to comfortably depress it.  I can do it.  But it's definitely not easy. 2)  I notice that upon first depressing the handles on the press, what emits from the tiny holes is basically garlic juice.  Uh-oh, I says to myself.  ""I'm losing flavor from the garlic.""  I know, it's going right into the food that I want to have garlic flavor in the first place, yes.  But, I find that it is when cooking the garlic that its true flavors are released and when this garlic ""juice"" hits the pan, it evaporates.  So, in fact, I DO lose flavor. 3)  Then, in order to get the little garlic ""noodles"" that are squeezed from the press to fall into the pan I am trying to cook in, I have to scrape them off of the press with a knife blade.  In other words, they do not fall off of the press of their own accord into the pan.  Another awkward and uncomfortable procedure, holding the garlic press over a hot pan with one hand while scraping garlic ""noodles"" off the press with a knife with the other. 4)  Then, upon opening the press, and examining it's contents to be sure I have entirely pressed the garlic clove, I find that about 10-20% of the pressed garlic remains stuck to the sides, bottom, corners of the press itself.  Uh-oh.  Loss of more garlic flavor. 5)  What I have cooked thus far using the garlic press tastes like it is missing ""something"" and - to be honest, I think it is the taste of the good old fashioned peeled/smashed/shopped garlic cloves that I can drop into the pan and watch sizzle a little bit before adding other ingredients -instead of evaporating in their own juices.  This means, that to get the full flavor of 3-4 garlic cloves with the garlic press, you need to ""press"" 5-6 garlic cloves.6)  We do not have a dishwasher.  Have YOU ever tried to wash this garlic press in soapy dishwater?  Even after it has been soaked for an hour or so?  Well, I'm telling you - you cannot get the garlic ""gunk"" out of it.  (All of which I look at and think how it should have been not in the garlic press but in my pot!)  And that little brush that comes with it?  Nice thought, but totally useless.Need I say more?Actually, I wonder what restaurants really use. Because I know enough to know it is NOT this garlic press.  I had high hopes - but I am greatly disappointed.  Basically this what-could-be-a-wonderful little kitchen tool misses the mark as far as I am concerned.  After all is said and done, I think were I to find a garlic press at Goodwill it would do as good (or as bad) a job as this.  I mean, certainly this falls into the ""better mousetrap category.""  And in this case, it ain't better than the one that my husband's FIRST wife of 50 years used all during their marriage!All of that being said, because there is a 100% satisfaction guarantee on this product, I returned it.  Granted, there were no questions asked.  And I do mean none. And I was instructed to print a return label.  Bottom line however, I think that the product is itself so cheap to manufacture, it is easier for the distributor to give 100% guarantees than to actually manufactures a garlic press that works.  If there is such a thing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B153647VANLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHLNRVE#wasThisHelpful","R3B153647VANLY","A2VFJIJVORI15O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VFJIJVORI15O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yucky!  You put a scoopful in a glass of water (just like it says) and it sits there, floating on top of the water like some kind of insoluable flotsum.  You stir and stir and stir and finally, some of it goes down into the glass and seems to dissolve.  You decide to drink it down in one go because floating around the top of the water are little tiny globules of the stuff and you think you won't notice them if you drink fast.  But, you do notice them!  This is not to mention that it smells -- well, not good.  I am going back to the pills, which I have taken for years.  I only changed because I was sick of taking so many pills.  They worked and they didn't tase or smell bad.  I cannot recommend this product.

"I absolutely LOVE this cookbook.  I LOVE the recipies in it.  I LOVE how it introduced me to a plant based way of life AND gave me delicious food to eat while getting acquainted.  I particularly like the way spices are used to flavor food (instead of meat and fat being what is used to flavor food).  I find the spice combinations in this cookbook to be - well, exquisite, if that's not too strong a word to use.  You can actually taste the different layers of flavors in the spice combinations used for Indian, Ethiopian, Mexican, South American, Asian, foods.  Your plate practically lights up.  Wow!  The only thing I would like better would be if the pictures were actually next to the recipies instead of glomped together in the middle of the book.  But - to tell you the honest truth, the book is so full of so many delicious recipies that once I started using them I didn't really care all that much.  I won't go into the whole weight loss thing - suffice to say that part is working too.  I am a devoted home cook.  I have been cooking all my life (and I am 7+ decades old).  I have dozens and dozens of cookbooks.  THIS is the one that helped me to understand what all the fuss is about when it comes to Vegan/plant based cooking.

"It's gory.  But then, it seems that nobody is able to write a book these days without there being some gore in it.  (Amazing how I went through my entire early years reading about the French Revolution without a single specific description of exactly what happens when someone's head is chopped off)!  It's also linguistically ""thick"" - that is, I felt sometimes like I was having to push aside a jungle of words.  But - it's a fairly good story about a particular POW situation during WWII.  Great descriptions of women (I won't worry about being politically correct here) and how mesmerizing they can be to men - which I, being a woman, liked reading.  Would I read it again?  No.  Will I remember it?  It will probably fade into the all the other books on the shelf in the back of my mind.

"First of all I did not get this product free or as a gift or anything of the sort.  I actually bought and paid for it.  (That being said, I seem to be the only one who did that - practically every review I read thus far is from someone who did NOT pay for it - what's up with that???)  Anyways, it's no matter I suppose because I found this juicer to be exactly as the manufacturer claims - ""Commercial Grade"" (i.e., it is definitely heavy duty).  Second of all, it is simple to use you don't even have to have any instructions.  You can figure it all out just by looking at it.  Third of all, it squeezes ALL of the juice out of the lemons and limes I tried it with and; Fourth of all - if the lemon was too big for my grasp (because it opened the handles wider than I was comfortable with) I cut the lemon in thirds and the Bitpsy STILL squeezed out all the juice.  Sufice to say - I love adding this wonderful tool to my kitchen.  Almost every recipe I make calls for either fresh lemon or fresh lime juice.  I am going to look up the manufacturer and see what ELSE they have to offer!  (Maybe a garlic press???)  :)  I gave this product Five stars with no problem and no questions asked.

"I am not ""educated"" about pro-biotics - but I know what I have been through.  So this will be a testimonial to this Pro-15 pro-biotics given in the context of my personal experience.  I have been dealing with effects of tricothecine poisoning (from long term exposure to black mold) for almost five years.  I was correctly diagnosed two and a half years ago (with many ""interesting"" and ""creative"" diagnoses along the way).  Without going into detail - let me say that I had horrible, horrible indigestion to include all of the symptoms so many others here have mentioned.  Six weeks ago, I saw a doctor who believes that ""all problems start with the gut"" (Including the symptoms from mold poisoning.  Imagine that!).  Of course his Food Coach recommended probiotics and soon after finding the RIGHT probiotics (Pro-15) ALL of my problems dissipated.  Not right away though.  It took about 3-4 weeks and about 4 pills a day but today, as I write this, I can say that I feel better in my digestion than I have felt in 5 years.  An incredible side effect of taking Pro-15 is that as it began to ""clear out my gut"" my back and leg pain went away!  Yep.  No lie.  My sick gut caused me intractible, chronic back and leg pain to the extent I thought I was going to have to walk with a cane.  I did have a terrible set back early on that I want to mention.  Because I did not know exactly which pro-biotic to take, I simply came to Amazon and ordered a ""Best Selling"" product, ""Digestive Advantage.""  Thinking that all probiotics are made the same, I am sad to say that it was not until I got sicker and sicker and sicker with more and more pain that I decided to READ THE INGREDIENTS.  Amazingly, several of the ingredients in ""Digestive Advantage"" were from ""Aspergillus.""  Not good for a person like me already suffering from mold poisoning.  So, Pro-15 had to not only help me with my old sick gut - but it had to fight against the my newly sickened gut from the aspergillus I had taken in ""Digestive Advantage.""  Along the way, I had e-mail conversations with the supplier of Pro-15 who helped me enormously.  Being a pro-biotic virgin (if I may) I had lots of questions pertaining to the fact that I take loads of charcoal on a daily basis (to ""suck up"" the tricothecine), etc. etc. I had fast, prompt and extremly informative responses from the Pro-15 representative which only served to enhance my appreciation for the quality of Pro-15.  So as not to have to take 4 pills a day (that being said, they are little round pills, a lot like the little black ones that most Chinese Medicine pills look like and they are very easy to swallow) I am next going to order the Advanced/extra strength pills.  Finally, I also want to add that I would never have found Pro-15 in the first place were it not for all the extremely helpful reviews on this cite.  Thank you all for your thoughtful and informed comments.  For the first time since I have been fighting this poisoning I feel like I am winning the battle.  No yucky acid reflux.  No waking up at night with a hard as rock stomach.  No horrible (ending up in the E/R) pain in the gut.  No cramps and spasms in the lower back and legs (for which I was told I needed back surgery).  No episodes of chest tightness/shortness of breath/weakness in the arms (yes, indigestion can mimic a heart attack), No being able to stand up straight because your gut feel like it is tied in knots.  etc. etc. etc.  You know the drill.  Thank you all again and thank you Pro-15 for your wonderful product.  (Given all the charcoal/etc. pills I take to inhibit the mold poisoning - I am eternally grateful for the time release aspect of your little wonder pills!)  BTW, I am a 72 year old woman.  Never too late to clear out your gut with Pro-15!!!  If you are this far into my post I want to thank you for taking the time to read the entire thing!  I hope it has been of help to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWPN5AE8GVDTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEKYNZA#wasThisHelpful","RWPN5AE8GVDTR","A2VFJIJVORI15O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VFJIJVORI15O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in Southern Arizona.  Through the years I literally had to stop eating outside in our beautiful summer evenings because of the mosquitos.  I guess that would include not being able to eat breakfast outside either.  Geez - I couldn't even BE outside in the mornings or in the evenings because of the mosquitos.  They literally drove me inside!  THEN I FOUND MOSQUITO BITS.  Within 24 hours of my husband applying it we noticed a difference.  Almost NO mosquitos.  Somewhere, either on the bottle itself or in reviews here, I read that it is not only good to spread the Bits in standing water - but also in flower beds where there is damp and wet soil and I am convinced that THERIN lies the cure!!!  That and applying it REGULARLY as well, like once every 6-7 days.  (I wish I could underline on this page - but I can't, so I use caps and it ends up looking like I am shouting -- Oh, well, I guess I could shout about this product).  It was surprising just how much damp and wet soil we had surrounding our little patio (such as in the tree wells, in the potted plants, etc.)  We had always applied mosquito control products in standing water only, not knowing enough to apply it in damp and wet soil as well.  All of that being said, while I understand this is a review for this product in particular-- I ALSO use an all-natural mosquito fogger that I got here on Amazon.com.  So, my husband and I have what we call a ""two-layered"" approach.  Not being a biologist in any sense of the word - I tell myself that what the Mosquito Bits doesn't get the mosquito fogger does.  I can't tell you how much we have enjoyed sitting outside on our patio -- even at sunset!  Do I still get bit by mosquitos?  Of course.  But just a little teensie bit.  Compared to having to run in the house scratching and not being able to sit outside at all.  Besides, it beats having to put all yucky lotion all over myself - which is an alternative I just do not like to use.  So?  Bottom line.

"I am a legal transcriptionist.  I work from home doing verbatim transcription of various legal interviews, courtroom recordings, etc.  Long story short - I am in front of my computer, typing, non-stop at least 6 hours a day.  (Throw in my e-mails, FB responses, etc. and it's probably more like 8 hours a day).  About 5 years ago I began having wrist stiffness and finger numbness.  Uh-oh, I says to myself.  Carpal tunnel.  Yikes!  I bought two wrist stabilizers and a so-called ""ergonomic"" keyboard.  No change.  Then, a sales person recommended the Microsoft 4000 -- within 3 days my wrist pain and finger numbness disappeared, never to return again.  Even given that the space bar is hard to depress, the number keys are hard to reach, the letters wear off the keys fairly quickly, and you can't really switch back and forth from this keyboard to standard keyboards (meaning, I can't go in and use my husband's computer unless I bring my 4000 with me!) for the reason that it does in fact allow my hands and wrists to operate in a more ""natural"" way while typing -- I have given it 5 stars.  If you are looking for what I was looking for, that is, a keyboard that will allow you to type all day (and I do mean all day) without causing pain/stiffness and numbness, then from my experience, I can recommend this keyboard.  In fact, I have two - one I use and one I keep as a back up so that I won't miss out on work if I spill anything on the one in use (which has happened many times).

"I noticed a difference in my skin immediately.  I am 72 years old.  In good health and in fact, while I have my share of wrinkles, I have fairly good skin.  (I wish I had taken ""before"" pictures to share here, but I didn't).  Over the years I have used a variety of treatments but felt that my skin was looking ""tired"" and, well -- old and I found that, after only TWO nights of use, I actually noticed a difference in my appearance.  I would call that an ""immediate improvement.""  I have been using it for three weeks now.  Have my wrinkles ""disappeared?""  Of course not. But the overall appearance of my skin has been markedly improved.  It looks more ""moist"" and ""dewy"" and ""alive.""  My husband noticed it without my even mentioning it.  So - for me this is a terrific product and, while a little pricey, worth it.  BUT -- notice that I have said ""FOR ME"" this is a terrific product.  It is my thinking that just like medicine, exercise, diet, (and even bathing suits), etc., when it comes to skin care products -- ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL.  That is - what ""fits"" me does not necessarily ""fit"" you.  No matter what the manufacturer tells you.  YOU HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING AND TRYING AND TESTING UNTIL YOU FIND THE PRODUCT THAT WORKS FOR YOU!!!  My skin is not exactly like yours -- or yours - or yours - I don't care what the tests in the laboratories have ""proven"" -- The bottom line is I am saying that based on the results I personally had, I gave it 5 stars and I think this product is worth you giving it a try.  It may fit/work for you -- on the other hand, it may not.  It is possible, just possible, that you are someone who DOES happen to have skin like mine and that you will benefit virtually overnight from it's use.  If you do not - well, as Bob Dylan says, keep what you like and leave the rest.  In other words, move on to find another product that will do for you what this one did for me.  At its worst it won't ""hurt"" you - and if you are thinking about this product, you are probably someone who is not horrified at the thought of spending this kind of money for face cream in the first place! (LOL)!  (BTW, I buy it from Amazon because I can use my points - which reduces the cash outlay considerably).It is now December and am back here after almost six months to give an update on this product.  The bottom line is last week I gave away my last half bottle to a friend who had been approached by a distributer.  Yep.  I gave it to her and told her to try it first and not spend her money on it.  Yes.  I did get a noticeable difference within the first few days.  But after that - NOTHING.  And wrinkles??? Are you kidding???  It did absolutely nothing after almost 6 months of consistent, regular use.  Maybe it works for people with younger skin than mine. Who knows.  I can no longer recommend it at all.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16WXMPDOGYWVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LDFU26#wasThisHelpful","R16WXMPDOGYWVB","A2VFJIJVORI15O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VFJIJVORI15O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this product solely on the reviews, which is a system that usually works just fine for me.  In this case however, what I read in the reviews and what I tasted in this ""Pure"" extract powder did not match.  I found this stevia to be bitter with a strong aftertaste.  I used it in yoghurt (without telling my husband) and he noticed the taste right away.  It tasted so ""funny"" that I threw it out.  I have used the little Stevia packets for years - maybe I'm just used to the taste of that product and couldn't adjust.  Who cares?  I only use it to sweeten yoghurt a few times a week.

"I bought it to clean my nebulizer, which is portable and uses soundwaves to force the medication through the breathing tube.  The directions that came with the nebulizer specifically instructed that it be sprayed with water and dried with ""gauze"" after every use.  (Gauze leaves no lint).  My husband went to the store right away and bought some gauze (Kirkland) and it worked okay.  I then went on Amazon and found this brand to be a better buy.  When I opened one of the little packages I was surprised to find that the pads actually amount to a smaller amount of gauze.  That is, while they were 2"" x 2"" - the fabric was not as ""hefty"" as what my husband had brought back from the store.  I expected them to absorb less but I was wrong.  I actually found these little gauze pads to be highly absorbant for their size and weight.  In fact, they were better than the Kirkland pads.  It led me to think that if I were in fact buying them for wound care, these pads would be highly absorbant.  Mind you, I am using them to absorb distilled water and so this is an ""experiment"" of one - but still, I thought I would share my experience in case it is helpful to someone who is wondering whether to buy this product.  I gave it five stars for the way it behaves for my purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29KPZEXI9MUIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RL9P6W#wasThisHelpful","R29KPZEXI9MUIJ","A2VFJIJVORI15O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VFJIJVORI15O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nothing like looking down and watching your weight go down (or up) in such beautiful blue letters.  Somehow - it's not as threatening as any other scale I've used.  (LOL!)  Besides that, I really like the look of it.  Doesn't take up a lot of visual space in the bathroom and doesn't scream ""she's trying to lose weight"" like so many other scales do!  (LOL).  Is quite flat and fits closely to the floor.  Doesn't wobble when you stand on it, giving you the feeling that it's weight is accurate and not a ""guessing game.""

"I found it hard to really get into this book. It was an interesting theory of the Bermuda Triangle. The explanation, when we finally get around to it, is intriguing. I've always had an interest in this topic and was excited to have a fictional novel about it. The story starts out with a bang. The first 20% was highly interesting. The problem being, it took so long for explanations and they were long winded, I found myself setting this book aside for days at a time, fighting to finish it. I wanted to know if those trapped on this island, made it out, so I kept with it. If you're into sci-fi, and not much action, this is going to be a great read for you. I wanted to see more action. Less explaining, more doing. The author has a great way of creating a scene. Making sure you know what everything looks like. The descriptions were fluid and in depth. I think what it lacked, besides action, was an emotional connection. Yes, they try to create a romance between two of the characters, but they are so quickly separated that it's a fleeting moment.

"*I received this book in exchange for an honest review*So, first thing I notice is the Old School mother. You know, the ones who know their husbands cheat, but since they are rich, they let it slide. I hate those mothers and this one sure put you in a mood to fight on Corrine's side! ""Real men don't cheat, Corrine."" That's right, they don't. Corrine finds her fiance cheating and calls off their wedding. She does what any other sane woman would do! She still goes on her honeymoon. But instead of Paris, she goes to Fiji. On a dare, she takes a man she just met and holy crap! Sparks fly. This is a wonderful romance. I loved to see Corrine finally treated the way she deserved. Everett knew what he wanted and he went for it. He fought for Corrine. What more could a woman ask for? This is a feel good romance, about letting go of the past, standing up for yourself and finding a love you really deserve!*At some times, the story did drag for me. It was a little slow, which is why it's 4 starts instead of 5. But other than that, this is an amazing adventure. You see Corrine open up, become daring, all at the hands of a man who from first sight, is intrigued.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F13RLE3CD38N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0157EGUAM#wasThisHelpful","R2F13RLE3CD38N","AABXUSGGXUY1Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AABXUSGGXUY1Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*I received this book in exchange for an honest review*Wow. Just wow. This was a great romance. I loved the up and down drama. The Russian angle, the real feel of a hockey sports romance. Aleksandr is one of my new favorite sports romance heroes! He was strong but still able to be soft. He wasn't a dirty player who is suddenly ""redeemed"" because of a woman. He had real goals in life, real ambition. The tight family was wonderful to read, especially when it helped Aleks feel better. This was a book that I couldn't put down! Literally, I was tailgating a football game and reading this book! That's how into I was. I could not put this down. The sexy romance was really a sports romance, and not just an athlete in name only. I loved hearing about the playing. I'm a sports fan! That's why I love sports romances!

I wasn't a fan of the BDSM talk/sex. I felt the story was so much better without it. (It's not an overtly erotic book) it ust didn't feel right. The story would have been 5 stars for me without it. I was into the sweet romance aspect. I feel the sex ruined it. I look forward to more from this author as they grow and learn.

"*I received this book in exchange for an honest review*I love this series. These books have some strong, passionate, alpha men with opinions and ideas that get in the way of their hearts! Pair them with some strong women and the stories just explode. Cain and Violet are no exception to this. You get that horrible teenage love triangle with them and their best friend Jeremy. But with Jeremy out of the picture, you have two people who can't admit that they love each other. Their romance was phenomenal. Heart breaking, romantic and full blown sexy. The only downfall is that I wish there was more fighting! That's one of my favorite parts of this series. The fights, the sweat, the blood! There's something about a man beating on another man that just amps up the sexy factor in this series.

"*I received this book in exchange for an honest review*Though this was an interesting romance, it was long, drawn out and I feel that it dragged way too slow. There were periods of slow moving scenes, the intermittion movie script parts, I feel took away from keeping me into the story. If it had flowed better, it would have been a 4 or 5 star romance. I loved Ivy and Logan. They were great together. Again, this story was just a great romance, it just needed some trimming down.The animosity between the stars of the movie was well done. The way the story played out turned it into a beautiful romance. I loved each character and the ending certianly shocked me, but was great. It was a great book. Truly, it was. I just hate slow moving stories that are held back by things that aren't necessary to the romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NJ2JJZOR54YZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X61OGZU#wasThisHelpful","R1NJ2JJZOR54YZ","AABXUSGGXUY1Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AABXUSGGXUY1Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received this book in exchange for an honest review*Wow, that's the first word that comes to mind after reading this book. I was highly impressed and am so looking forward to reading more by this author! The story was captivating, sexy, romantic and had some great action in it.""Ye're a strong wee thing. I've half a mind to let ye toss a few cabers at the next games.""I love the Scottish accent and if you're anything like me, when you read books like this, you hear that accent in your mind as you read the words. Kieran and Mariel are just amazing characters. I felt connected to them in a way that sucked me into their story. I enjoy Highland books, but this really is just a wonderfully written story. Some historicals get slow and drag down in pace, and are too long. This book was just perfect. The pace was kept smooth and flowy, the story had no gaps and I read the last page with a big, bright smile on my face. I look forward to more from this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ILHVOKBXOSY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0113B8K60#wasThisHelpful","R2ILHVOKBXOSY2","AABXUSGGXUY1Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AABXUSGGXUY1Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say, I've always been a sucker for a good action book. Nelson Demille was my favorite author until I got my kindle and found so many other books to read. Weekly I'd be at the book story buying another paperback. So, needless to say, when I tell you I'm in love with these books, I mean it.This author knows how to write a suspenseful novel. Jack Noble is my new favorite action character. The suspense is so well written. The action is almost non-stop. I do feel bad that he has no luck with the ladies, but Noble doesn't need it. He's smart, strong and brings you one of the most amazing action novels out there. I'm dying to read more by this author, and about this character. You won't be disappointed in reading this box set!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C0B89MS36MQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1QC2KK#wasThisHelpful","R2C0B89MS36MQV","AABXUSGGXUY1Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AABXUSGGXUY1Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, I've read all of the Dare books by this author. I've started going back to read the ""Classics"". This was actually a great book. I loved the interactions between Chelsie and Griff. Wow. Anger, Passion, Betrayal, Love, Fireworks. It was hot, sexy and certainly tear-worthy. There were spots that just had me tearing up. But it also warms your heart! If you want a good romance, good like they used to be, where you steal a book from your grandmother and hide it in your bedroom good...... grab this book! It certainly was nostalgic and just wonderfully romantic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L5D3CO6SR898/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5OGLHQ#wasThisHelpful","R2L5D3CO6SR898","AABXUSGGXUY1Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AABXUSGGXUY1Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received this book in exchange for an honest review*I am an avid Historical Romance reader. I love the historicals. They are always sexy and interesting, action and more. This book, though a cute premise and wonderful characters, it was so long and dragged on and on, that I got bored. I wanted to know what happened, but the in between parts were just way to long in between and I wanted to stop reading.Of course, I didn't, I finished the book. How could I not? I needed to know what happened. Beyond getting bored by how long the story felt, I thought the girls were fun. The games they played, trying to set Jane and Garrett up together were adorable. I felt they were silly and fun characters. Jane, well she was independent, head strong and wonderful. I feel if I lived in that area, she so would be me! Garrett, well damn. The man couldn't figure out what he wanted, but he was so hot it didn't matter. I fell in love with this man.The drama was great. It flowed well without being over the top. I've read some where the drama is so far fatched and too much that I end up rolling my eyes instead of enjoying it. That's not this book. The plot was just wonderful, I only feel it could have been trimmed down a bit to flow the whole story better! If you enjoy historicals, I certainly suggest this author.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK8GVLQT22YDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OFL6QKI#wasThisHelpful","RK8GVLQT22YDT","AABXUSGGXUY1Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AABXUSGGXUY1Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received this book in exchange for an honest review*I love these two. This was a sweet romance that gripped me in it's tale. Jess runs from her past and Cole just wants her. I loved the characters. The drama wasn't over the top. It was perfect for the story. The plot was a wonderful read. Horses, ranch life, small town, this book has it all and it's truly a wonderful read.

"*I received this book in exchange for an honest review*I really loved the first book in this series. This one wasn't bad. It was just, over done for me. The Outlaws and the Belles. Hate each other, fall in love. Blah Blah. Over and over, I feel like this book is identical to the other one basically. Yes, the story line slightly shifts and changes. It was Cameron who's wild, Saint who's in love but won't act on it.I just feel like other than the names, these stories were the same as the other girl. It was too similar for me to really enjoy it. I suppose that's the way with some series. The books are all so alike that it's just over done and I feel that's how it was with this one. But, if you haven't read the series yet, you could certainly start here. It's a funny romantic comedy.Cameron and Saint get themselves into some trouble. Mayor Judy is always sticking her nose in everyone's business and leading the Sheriff around by his nose. There are some great parts to this book. Like I said, it was too redundant.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBNUZF7RWFW4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PBI3Y#wasThisHelpful","RBNUZF7RWFW4J","AABXUSGGXUY1Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AABXUSGGXUY1Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When Eve and Connor finally put their differences aside to help each other and his kids after he gets custody of them, sparks fly and more! I loved this whole story.

Pretty much an independent, do what he wants type.Then there's Abby, the chubby pretty rich girl that lives with his long lost father. She tries to be nice to people but they think they can walk all over her because they pay attention to her. Not cool at all! In comes Cage and holy sexiness commences!!!!

"*I received this book in exchange for an honest review*So, Dani and Rand. Not your typical, from the wrong side of the tracks romance. Dani is actually a con artist, a theif, and more. But, she has some morals. Of course she helps when 'little bro' comes calling. And here's Rand, who's from the rich family, perfect life, or so you think. We quickly find out that's not the truth. From there, the relationship builds. Dani gets Rand to do things she would have never thought a man like him could do. Rand gets Dani to give up control. This was actually a fun, sexy romance. It will keep you on your toes page by page. The characters are likeable, the plot was decent, and not completely over done, so it's certainly a sexy way to spend your day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C4QRCHDQK8F9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PD2AG#wasThisHelpful","R3C4QRCHDQK8F9","AABXUSGGXUY1Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AABXUSGGXUY1Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The characters are likable and realistic. I'm actually interested to see what happens to the next couple..The only reasons I didn't rate it a 5 was the format and editing. I got this copy off of Amazon, paid for it. Yet it read like a bad PDF. There were paragraphs and pages that ended and repeated on the next page. It happened throughout the whole book. The editing could use some work. There were spots of than instead of then. Correctly spelled, but wrong word, or missing words in sentences.

"I'm a health food nut, so Nutpods were destined to be in my life.....truthfully, I had given up ever finding a creamer that was A) Healthy and B) actually compared in richness to the old coffee creamers I used back in the day when I still thought I could eat healthy without reading labels. But hope springs eternal, and I decided to try one more. Glad I did. This adds just the right touch to my decaf, organic coffee in the mornings. I was already adding collagen powder, colostrum, gelatin powder, coconut oil, and Ghee. Yes, my life is pretty much an ongoing science experiment, but it's great when my potions taste great as well. I will buy this again. At first sip, I thought the Hazelnut might be a tad too strong, but it mellows out, and I'm pretty much into this flavor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5HF849Q0WC0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WWU2Y4#wasThisHelpful","R5HF849Q0WC0N","AF1H4YRBRMBB9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF1H4YRBRMBB9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I research every product I use to the nth degree, and this is one of the top 3 colostrum powders. I've tried all 3, and I'll probably stay with this one as the price and quality are there for me. I've gone through 2 years of serious digestion problems, and I won't go into all that I've done for it, but it has been a struggle as I don't use OTC or prescription meds. Not even an aspirin. I'm a healthy senior who eats organic, walks, and does yoga. Despite all this, I couldn't seem to find the answer, having spent hundreds, even thousands, on supplements I had read about. When I found colostrum, my body had begun healing and was ready for something to take me into maintenance. I take one scoop (they're quite small) each morning in my organic decaf coffee and stir it in with a little frother, or two if I'm feeling the tummy acting up again, but at this point, I'm eating whatever I want, any time of day, and feeling ""normal"".

"I have a jewelry box full of nice earrings of every description, but mostly I don't wear them. These are just what I was looking for, to leave in all the time, earrings that are comfortable enough to sleep in.

So, once I figured out how to get the wires through the holes in my ears, I took my time, even resting in between, and finally got that little ""click"".

"Over the years, since I was a teen, my hair has been my own private science project, sometimes with great results, sometimes not so much. Good thing about hair, it will always grow off....So here I am, 75% grey in front, graduating to 75% brunette in back, and it's not a pretty grey. It just makes me look tired....I've wished for the platinum tresses in magazines, and I found an excellent tutorial on how to achieve such platinum-ness. But even using all the high dollar fillers, toners, etc., my hair would not remain platinum and always settled after a few days into a very pretty, believable light blonde, which was fun but really made my skin tones look washed out. And I decided I did not want to go into these autumnal years having to bleach roots and redo the whole process every 4-6 weeks. So, I began looking around for alternatives, and I have my plans laid for low-lighting my way back into an eventually more natural color, somewhere betwixt brunette and soft grey, but I ordered this just to see what it would do in the meantime, and it changed my hair (almost) back to its natural brunette with all the shade variations! I've got about an inch of regrowth, and it softens the line somewhat, so I've got more time to decide how I want to handle this. It comes off on my pillow if I perspire at all at night, but for the time being I'm happy with it. I have very fine, porous hair, and lots of it. Fanciful Temporary Hair Color also gives me a bit of volumizing. It raises some concerns on the EWG Skin Deep site where it got an overall 5 but as high as 7 on specific toxicology, so worth a read, and I don't plan on using it for very long. Natural is better, but I think this will help me get there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YVZNR3Q5B1WC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VS604A#wasThisHelpful","R2YVZNR3Q5B1WC","AF1H4YRBRMBB9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF1H4YRBRMBB9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Glycine helps me sleep more soundly, something I've been having trouble with the past few years. It only takes a small amount for me, 1/8 tsp at night, which I put under my tongue and let dissolve, or I stir it into a cup of herbal tea like Nighty-Night or Easy Now because it's sweet. I'm very sensitive to any supplements, though, and I have to find the right amount. One night I had the bright idea of taking it both ways, thus a whopping 1/4 tsp in all, and I was up most of the night, feeling buzzed, so too much has the exact opposite effect on me.

"I thought I had reviewed this hair color, but I can't find it. Anyway, I narrowly escaped major disaster when I used one of the two boxes I received. My first instinct was, well, it's all natural; what damage can it do? It will probably wash out quickly if I don't like the color. And I almost put it all over my hair, but at the last moment I stopped and just did one rather large strand of hair on the left of my forehead. Thank all the gods there be that I didn't do my whole head! The color could only be described as bright copper on my 75% grey hair...... it literally GLOWED. Not to worry, it will wash out in a few shampoos, but it never washed out, for months, until I frosted my hair and bleached it out. I'm 60+, and it looked like some of the teenage color experiments I see online, not quite my style ^,,^ The second box is in the back of the cabinet along with my collection other bath and beauty products that will never be used......I wish there were a collective where we could all try each others' throw-aways.I'm glad it works so well for some.

At first he tried the Pinterest sure-fire natural weed killers like vinegar, salt & Dawn. They did nothing but waste time and kitchen products.

"A shiny, clean toilet bowl was never an issue until we moved to our current rural home. I always just swished bowl cleaner around with a brush once a week, and it stayed looking new. Then we moved here to a new house and over 12 years time, all 3 bowls began to get a crusty built-up ring at the waterline; also the upper portion of the bowls became grayish and rough. It has to be chemicals or minerals in the local water supply. (We filter drinking and shower water.) I've even had water dept. guys come out and test the water. They acted as if they'd never heard such a complaint and that nobody else ever had that problem!I've tried every cleanser I could find, tried chipping away at the mess with razor blade and pumice, and still when we had guests, I felt the need to say that the toilet bowl wasn't dirty, just bad water. I don't know how long these pads have been on the market, but I wish I'd discovered them a heckuva lot sooner.I didn't even have much hope when I spied them on Amazon, but the positive reviews won me over.They worked perfectly! That's not to say they're magic, and you only have to wave them over the bowl. I rubbed and scrubbed and sweated 12 years of crud off for about 15 minutes per bowl. I called hubby in to see the transformation. He wasn't as impressed as I was, (he who has even considered using muriatic acid to clean the bowls) but never mind.My toilet bowls look ""normal"" again, and I'm back to order another pack or two. It took both pads to clean my bowls, but I expect that now I can keep up with the crud formation, and it won't require prolonged scrubbing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JFWYO43J5NHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YV2BY0#wasThisHelpful","R1JFWYO43J5NHH","AF1H4YRBRMBB9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF1H4YRBRMBB9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I looked at these for years, would love to have a built-in bidet, but it's just not going to happen. I also figured these were a total hassle to install, so I just waited. I'm glad I finally purchased this one. Installation instructions are clear and easy to follow, but my grown son only glanced at the sheet, tossed it aside, and installed it in less than 15 minutes; he's good at anything mechanical. This was over 5 months ago.It has worked perfectly from the beginning. I'm the only one who uses it in my bathroom. I had thought that the cold water might be a problem. It isn't. It just feels cool and refreshing. There's a slight learning curve in finding the ultimate water angle/pressure adjustment, but it has a lot of settings around the dial, so not a problem in finding the happy medium. You want one that's direct but not so forceful that it gives you an enema. I wash back and forth, front and back a few times, and there's hardly any paperwork to be done. Just blot dry.I had had some itching and burning issues for years. I'd tried so many things, gentle wet wipes, handheld bottle bidet, etc., but the Luxe Bidet Neo 180 has solved all that, and I seriously wouldn't want to be without it.There's hardly any cleaning of the unit itself. When I'm washing the toilet bowl I splash a little water on the front panel with the brush. That's it.Everyone should have a bidet of some sort.

I was also a literature and psychology major, so deep, elusive symbolism excites me.... this tale offers nothing but dark, uninteresting, disjointed segments with a few oddball, meaningless ""symbols"" thrown in to keep us thinking we're onto something if we just stay with it long enough. Not. I had to pause it about halfway through to make dinner, and afterwards realized I didn't care enough about how it came out to resume. There are just too many flaws in the plot to entice me to go along with it.

I begin with hot water poured over the tea and then set it on the warmer....There's no smoke; I've had it for several months, and it still doesn't need washing....It draws plenty of air to keep the candle burning.

"I've owned this book for a few years, and in my ongoing quest for natural, healthy remedies, I keep stumbling across references to it, think maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance, browse through it for 15 minutes and place it back on the shelf. It's just a rambling, badly organized collection of claims but mainly a 600+ page advertisement for the author's products. I might not even mind that, but when I go to reviews for the products, which are very pricey, they hardly have any reviews, so I'm guessing not many people are trying them after reading the book.Another problem for me is that most everything else in the book is about medical procedures, done by your doctor. I gave up on doctors decades ago and have done myself far more good than they ever did, but if you're a believer in Big Pharma, and see your doctor regularly, then this might be a gem for you. Maybe in some areas of the country there are physicians who would gladly implement the procedures, but in my little corner of the world, I'm quite sure they'd be like what kind of idiocy has she come up with now?One small segment in the book tells how to self-administer food grade peroxide ""for the Less Advantaged"". Okay, I'm not really Less Advantaged, but it feels as if he's talking down to people who prefer to take responsibility for their health into their own hands. I'm 60+, healthier than anybody I know even close to my age, but I'm human and get some health challenges, aches, and pains from time to time. I trusted the reviews, but obviously didn't read enough, and thought this was another great reference book. It's not.I just now downloaded ""Hydrogen Peroxide and Aloe Vera Plus Other Home Remedies"" on my Kindle (free to Prime customers). I haven't read it yet, but the preview looked like down-to-earth remedies a person could try for himself/herself. I've got ""The One-Minute Cure: The Secret to Healing Virtually All Diseases"" on hold at my local library. It also got mixed reviews, but I figure if I come away from each title with one or two believable remedies to try, I'm ahead of the game.

"We have a Biozone air cleaner and a Winix WAC5500, both of which are quietly perfect, and I wanted a third one for the kitchen side of the house but was trying to go a little less expensive. Out of the box, you have to turn it on its side, open the bottom and install the filter, which isn't a big deal, but the other two I just opened them, plugged them in, and they were ready. Next, this thing is enormous, isn't all that attractive, and it says to set it 3 feet from the wall. I might have managed to find it a place to live if it weren't so loud. Maybe in loud homes with lots of kids, pets and commotion, it wouldn't be such an issue, but in ours, people sitting in the same room would be straining to talk and hear over it, on low. The other two speeds, forget about it. As someone said in another review, it sounds like a jet engine warming up. I bought it from Walmart and will be returning it tomorrow.

"I have found that alternating my bedtime teas helps. This is my latest of 4 that I use, and it immediately became my favorite. The scent is rich and reminds me of Tiramisu. As it's cooling, I sit and breathe it in. The taste is the same and sweet enough, but sometimes I add a teaspoon of local honey.It helps me fall asleep easier. I also alternate several different forms of Melatonin (patch, liposomal, compound and sublingual) and some other natural supplements along with the teas. All in all, they're not perfect, but they make my nights restful, even if I don't sleep like a log straight through. I've done all the recommended things for getting restful sleep, including dark room, sleeping away from electrical outlets, early supper, and I don't drink coffee, tea or use refined sugars or gluten. So yes, I'm trying, and this tea makes it all a little easier. I'm at a stage in my life where I have to accept that my nights of falling into bed, going out like a light and sleeping 8 or 9 hours are past. I've read a few books on insomnia, and it helps to know that our ideal sleep schedule is a modern invention. People used to go to bed when the sun went down, sleep for 3 or 4 hours, get up and putter around, maybe even visit neighbors, then go back to bed and sleep till sunrise. It helps is you don't think of periodic wakefulness as a handicap. On the nights when I simply can't lie in bed, I get up, accompanied by my shih tzu, and pile up on the sofa with my iPad or watch TV for a couple of hours, then go back to bed when I'm sleepy.Thank you, Yogi, for your healthy, soothing teas.

"I've got so many art interests, watercolor being one, that I sort of wander hither and yon. Well, in November of 2012, I received this book, was disappointed as I paged through it because the format and illustrations do seem small. I stuck it in my big ol' art library, though, and went on to something else. Lately, though, I've cycled back to watercolors, particularly the loose, imaginative variety of Ms. Trevena, and I was thrilled to find I still had her book! So, I spent the better part of a day reading closely, cover to cover, digesting all the techniques, and I must say, it's a book worth having. Her directions are easy to follow, and illustrations are clear enough to give a good grasp of her points.She does one complete painting, in depth, from inception to final stroke, broken into segments that make perfect sense and are interspersed with additional techniques. This isn't a book where the artist gives a specific color palette and brushes, but I actually like this better. She suggests types of brushes and color harmonies along with creative tools you might not have considered. It's a book that might be confusing for beginners, but even they can pick up some excellent pointers and keep the book for later reference. Of her 3 books I know about, this one seems to be the best for technique.

"I make a lot of apple pies, using the small, using organic red and yellow delicious apples. At first I thought that the imperfect peeling was because the apples were so small, so I bought larger apples and got the same results. Maybe my apples are shaped wrong, but I've yet to get a wide, perfect peel like that shown. It skips around, leaving ridges of peel in between, sometimes stops and won't proceed till I either crank the blade back around or switch the position of the apple, but the end result is that, along with the corer/slicer, it's a heckuva lot easier and faster than preparing them all by hand. I just have to take a knife and clean them up before slicing and coring. Maybe I'll happen onto those perfectly shaped apples that give perfect peeling results someday :)Edit: I took away more stars because just after the return date, the red gears inside the peeler's housing began breaking off, and now it's completely useless.

"My 3 year old Shih Tzu isn't a good eater, and for most of his life I've been cleaning up barf a few times a week, whether he's eaten a lot or nothing. The vet just says he's eaten grass in the backyard, but that's not true, so I've kept searching for something to help with his super sensitive tummy. I tried the chewable enzymes, and the only way he'll eat them is if I hide them in peanut butter, but he catches on pretty fast. I got this powder, hoping I could dissolve it in his drinking water, but didn't have much hope because his sense of smell is amazing. Well, it dissolves just fine, and he doesn't seem to notice it; he still drinks a lot of water. I've been using it for a few months, and he has still vomited a few times but not as frequently as before. I'm going to use the whole jar (it will last a long time) and then decide whether to reorder, but I'm hopeful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J37M7YF56BPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OCWAIO#wasThisHelpful","R1J37M7YF56BPI","AF1H4YRBRMBB9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF1H4YRBRMBB9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This little sweater fits him perfectly, but he actually runs out of one arm when he's chasing his ball in the backyard. I'm not sure how because it couldn't fit any better. He's 3 years old and weighs 12 pounds. Anyway, we're having a colder winter than usual here, and I feel better when he goes outside to slip something warm on him.

"For me, this one's a winner. I've been avoiding gluten for nearly a year, and I've pretty much lost my ""Wheat Belly"", but even with the explosion of gluten free products, it's always hit or miss on the flavor, even within brands. The first time I made these, I just made them plain, and they actually tasted a bit too sweet (I also avoid as much sugar as possible). So, the second time I put a couple of handfuls of chopped pecans in them, and they're just about perfect. I like a light, crisp cookie, so I bake them a few minutes longer than directed. They're so good with my morning coffee. My husband calls me the cookie monster, so yes, I know my cookies.

Quite impressed.-Flash light battery was DOA. :(-The knife wouldn't cut paper out of the box, but since it's 420 stainless, I knew it would be easy to sharpen.  About 10 minutes on my KME sharpening system and this guy was push cutting telephone paper.  After extensive cardboard cutting, a couple of strokes on my strop and it was back to shaving sharp.  The thing with 420 is, it's easy to sharpen, but it loses it's edge fairly quickly.-I like the design and style of the knife.  The wood handles are very nice as well.  I wear a large sized glove so the handle was about half an inch too short for me.  Folks with big paws should be forewarned.I'm a knife nut.  I have high end production knives to low cost Moras.  To me what keeps this knife from being 5 stars is the cost.  For what you get this is about a $40 knife.  Lose the flashlight, lose the fero rod, extend the handle just a bit, use a higher quality stainless, and charge $40.  That would sell like hotcakes.

In my opinion the Mora Bushcraft and Mora Companion are better suited for this role.For backpackers, there is no rattle in the sheath and the retention is adequate, but I would not risk inverted carry.For folks who may use this for food prep, there is a slight gap where the blade meets the handle.

I wanted the brightest LED model available and 11W was the highest at the time.  At the rated 700 lumens it's roughly as bright as my 60 watt incandescent (I just looked it up, a 60 watt incandescent is approximately 800 luments so that makes sense).  All in all I'm very happy with the lamp.  Whodathunk lamps could be so fancy?  Hope this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JDM8THWIBWLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YP4A1U6#wasThisHelpful","R2JDM8THWIBWLN","AGSFDOSH4GJ2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGSFDOSH4GJ2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So if you're looking into a compression wrist wrap you're probably wanting a little extra support in your wrist for the heavy lifts.  Now it comes down to price and quality.  For $9.99 I wasn't expecting a whole heck of a lot.  I opened them up tried them on and was pleasantly surprised.  The elastic is nice, thick and wide.  The velcro is durable and strong.  It's a high quality product, way better and less expensive than the stuff you can get at your local stores.  This product is easy for me to recommend.  Hope this helps!

"For some strange reason, I haven't been able to buy this locally so I've resorted to Amazon.  I've tried a lot of different brands, but I always end up coming back to the tried and true Chapstick Spearmint.  It works and I like the scent.  For a manly man (as manly as you can get while applying lip balm) your options are limited.  Either you can use the medicine scents or the spearmint.

"This is a great EDC.  It rides light and small in pocket and the fit and finish are excellent.  This is a very low key knife, what sets it apart though is that there's no other brand name knife on the market that weights this little, uses CPM S35VN steel, made in the USA and costs $75.  If you're looking for a lightweight, high quality, high end steel, user knife at an affordable price, this is it.A few things to note about this knife for prospective buyers:-This knife has a shorter handle which makes it easier to carry in pocket.  The trade off is if you have large size hands, using the handle alone you'll probably only get a 3 1/2 finger grip.  I prefer using the forward choil, which gives me more control of the blade and plenty of room for a 4 finger grip.  If you have large hands and don't like using the forward choil, this may be an issue for you.-This uses a strong lockback.  The deployment requires a good amount of force if you want to be able to flick this knife open quickly.  Most folks end up doing a slow, controlled deployment with their thumb.-The Spydie hole is a love it or hate it feature.  The hole is, by design, machined fairly sharp.  Not enough to cut you, but you'll definitely feel it.  If you're not use to it, give it time before you make up your mind.-The handle is made up of FRN to save on weight.  This is also a love it or hate it feature.  I prefer FRN because of the weight savings, others hate it because they think it looks and feels cheap.Good luck on your knife purchase, hope this helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJO6IGXDOJBHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILFN5DU#wasThisHelpful","RJO6IGXDOJBHU","AGSFDOSH4GJ2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGSFDOSH4GJ2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price, these straps can't be beat.  The straps are nice and thick which make it easier to wrap around the bars.  The neoprene padded wrist strap does exactly what they're advertise to do, eliminate the pain from the straps digging into your hands/wrist.  I've used thinner straps without the wrist padding and when you start going heavy it really does dig into your hands/wrist.  The only negative thing I see with these straps are that the length of the wrist padding is a little long making these straps more comfortable for people with bigger wrist.  I had my wife try these on and because her wrist are smaller, she wasn't able to get a tight loop around her wrist.  The smaller the loop around the wrist, the easier it is to get a nice tight lockup on the bars.  For people who have never used straps, you want to make sure that when you put them on, the direction of the strap is between your thumb and index finger and not pointing towards your pinkie.  Secondly, when wrapping them around the bars, the bar goes between the straps and your hands.  So when you loop the strap around the bar its: strap, bar, hands, and not: bar, strap, hands.

I decided to go with Stalion because I've been impressed by their cases.I was a little worried this wouldn't hold up but this is one of the best accessories I own for my mobile device.

I have the Note 4 and I watch a lot of YouTube on it and the lack of a kickstand makes it difficult to properly enjoy it. They make cases with kickstands but those cases don't simultaneously provide protection so this is the ultimate compromise. I get to have the case I wanted and have a kickstand too. And it's not like it's just something that can be done with it. It's extremely sturdy and the height can be adjusted. It even works decently in portrait mode.

"This stand offers a great solution to all the common problems associated with razor and brush shaving. Namely, the inconvenience, mess, damage to equipment, and even occasional injuries it can cause. Stored upright on their two-prong hangers, your razor and brush pose less risk of being improperly grabbed which can cause injury. In this position they also receive air circulation to facilitate faster drying, which helps extend their life and prevent the growth of bacteria, mold, and rust. It has enough heft and balance so that when you remove one (razor or brush) it doesn't topple over. Looks great on the bathroom sink and is very well designed.

It fits the phone snugly and the openings lineup perfectly with the plugs, buttons, and connections giving access to all of the phone's functions. It has a lip/rim that is raised a tiny bit above the face of the phone so that if you lay your phone face down, the face of your phone is raised slightly and protected. The textured rubber of the lower bumper is exposed in a cute design on one side of the phone and it gives you a nice no-slip grip.

"I was a little worried this wouldn't hold up but this is one of the best accessories I own for my mobile device. Besides being the absolutely perfect car mount which is incredibly easy and fast to use, the item has an additional feature that might actually be better than its intended purpose. I don't know if this is one of the stated features of this mount but I've been using it as a kickstand for my phone and it's absolutely perfect for that purpose. I have the Note 4 and I watch a lot of YouTube on it and the lack of a kickstand makes it difficult to properly enjoy it. They make cases with kickstands but those cases don't simultaneously provide protection so this is the ultimate compromise. I get to have the case I wanted and have a kickstand too. And it's not like it's just something that can be done with it. It's extremely sturdy and the height can be adjusted. It even works decently in portrait mode. I stuck the magnet between the TPU and plastic of my phone and even on bumps the phone stays in place.

"Seriously? iFlash might be the most underrated screen protector maker. They literally sell two or three for the price of 1 from other companies. This screen protector looks premium and feels premium. Hands down, it is better than those regular, plastic screen protectors. I would recommend anyone looking for a tempered glass screen protector or even just a screen protector to go for this one and this brand. It feels like the actual glass of the phone when you use it. You just need to be careful when installing it to not get any dust between the screen and the glue of the screen protector because it may get somewhat annoying to use it when dust is lodged there. It's a lot easier to install than a regular screen protector because you won't get any bubbles and as much dust in between the glass and the screen protector when you install it.

"I ordered this cellphone case by Stalion for the Galaxy S6 because I have had good experiences with their iphone cases. This case is clear and shows off the original design of the s6 which is important because everyone has been complaining about the Galaxy line using premium materials. Well now you have premium and you're going to cover it with plastic? If so, then at least make sure it looks good. The case fits nice and snug and goes on within a minute. The feel of the case is mixture of matte and almost a rubber feel. It serves purpose and protects it from slipping by providing a good grip to clasp on to. It has surpassed by drop test. Overall, this case has a great design and I do feel it protects it from scratches and breaks.

"I got these for my Note 5 and since my wife has a S5, purchased this set as well. This is the brand to buy because they give you THREE glasses. For the price of what other companies are charging you get THREE so that's a major win. Here are some tips on how to best install these.

Place the screen saver with protective film still on over your phone's screen to get an idea of what you're dealing with.

Something that I learned from window tinting, clean, clean, CLEAN THAT SCREEN! The one thing that will hinder the adhesive from sticking properly is dirt, dust, and oil. It has to be cleaned just before you apply. Not clean, walk away, then come back and apply. It only takes a second for dust in the atmosphere to settle back. Use the wet cleaning cloth that comes with it and wipe from one side to the opposite...not in a circular motion.

"I was provided a free version of this product in exchange for an honest review. I've tested a number of selfie sticks overs the years. The PerfectDay Foldable QuickSnap Pro 3 in 1 version is one of the best that I have tried. First of all, it's very easy to get set up. My phone locked into place securely and from there your biggest concern is taking the winning shot. Secondly, the QuickSnap has a perfect range to get quality pictures with the added bonus of being able to adjust the head by up to 270 degrees. This give you a superior chance to get pics from just about every angle. I also appreciate that it folds back up easily and can be easily tucked away for lightweight and non-bulky transport. Overall, this is a well-made product that is capable of helping you to really capture some amazing pictures, especially spontaneous group shots. Five stars for one of the best selfie sticks I have ever used.Here's a hint, if you have a S6 or Note 5, the front facing camera has an option for a wide angle selfie.

"Skinomi has been in the skin game, probably the longest with Zagg. I had a chance to try out this product to review so is it better or any different? The kit comes with a solution, a lint free cloth, and a squeegee to apply the protector. You actually apply it wet, with a small amount of the enclosed solution that you squeegee out which allows you to reposition it as needed and leaves no air bubbles.

"Installing screen protectors is an absolute nightmare for me- no matter how ""lint free"" of an environment you choose- there is still that tiny particle of dust that leaves a HUGE air bubble! IQ Shield is the newest on the market, similar to skinomi or zagg. I had a chance to try out this product to review so is it better or any different? The kit comes with a solution, a lint free cloth, and a squeegee to apply the protector. You actually apply it wet, with a small amount of the enclosed solution that you squeegee out which allows you to reposition it as needed and leaves no air bubbles.

"I've been thinking about buying a BGE for a month or more. I may still buy one. However, until then, I've been slow cooking ribs and chicken on my propane Weber Q300. I've had trouble getting wood chips to burn on the grill grates. I keep the temperature low around 225-250, and because the heat source is relatively close to the food, I can't afford to get the wood burning or it'd compromise the meat. I have to say this little simple tube filled with quality pellets did the trick. Costco had a Traeger rep selling smokers/grills, but they also had 20lb bags of Hickory and Apple pellets. I bought a bag of the Hickory, rushed home, and loaded up the tube with pellets (Buying the pellets from Costco will save you tons of $). For those that don't know, the manufacturer of the tube suggest that you use a propane torch to get the pellets lit at the open end of the tube. At first I was confused how you get them lit and position them on the grill. Excellent smoke flavor even from grilling.

"This thing is awesome. Believe the reviews, I had the fast charger from choe tech and wanted another qi charger at work. I had a coupon code from my first purchase so I bought it this at a promo price. Charges my Note 5 really quickly. It works through a Caseology bumper case without issues. The lights are ambient, so they dim or go out if the lighting in the room goes down or out, and they are bright in well lit rooms. I bought (and returned) another wireless charger and it made a whining noise. This one is whisper quiet. No noise. It also seems to handle a full charge well. Some qi chargers either stop charging after the device reaches 100% causing you to get your device in the morning with 85% or so because they don't start again. Others keep charging, even at 100% getting the device super hot and doing who knows what kind of damage. This one gets mildly hot, but seems to stop charging at 100% and then, when the battery drains a little, it starts charging again. Exactly like you'd want.

"The Slider Series case by Stalion is one of the more minimal cases on the market. The material the case is made of is a nice matte rubbery material that gives the case a non-slip grip. Other cases have a smooth texture that I always feel will fall out of my hand at any time. It’s a two piece slider case so it’s really easy to take on and off. The bottom fourth of the case comes apart and allows you to slide your phone in easily. The cutouts are perfect, with a generous cutout for the camera, speakers, and lightning port. The volume up and down buttons are easy to press and are covered as well. The cutout for the vibration toggle switch makes flipping the switch a bit harder but I’ve found this to be common across most cases. Overall, this is a nice case with a premium matte look and feel. It fits the S5 snugly in all sides.

"I was skeptical about the claims but had I had an offer to review this item so I had nothing to lose and received it from Amazon. All I can say is that it works for me! I take 2 caps in the morning and it helps me remember and it helps me to find the elusive words that I sometimes forget. You know..... the ""I've got it on the tip of my tongue"" moments. I find myself remembering things that I had forgotten years ago... If I forget to take it, then I feel more ""foggy-brain"". It really makes difference. I believe it's due to the Chlorophyl in it and being able to pass through the blood brain barrier. That's a good thing! I also checked the company online and found it to be a safe reputable company.

"Combined w/ creatine this is a solid supplement. I was surprised by the flavor my first cup. It's not your run of the mill lemon-lime flavor where you can tell it was powdered, it tastes great.

"I had read product reviews for other tempered glass protectors that mentioned the ""halo"" effect that is created because the protectors can't go all the way to the edge of the screen. I can see how this effect can be seen with some protectors but this one doesn't have it. To be honest, I had hesitated to purchase one of these for precisely that reason -- pictures I had seen of other phones looked really bad and I didn't want anything to interfere with the picture on my screen. I had promo code to reduce the price so it was a no brainer to try it out.

"I have tried several brands of screen protectors however this is the 2nd time I have tried a tempered glass one on a tablet. This is by far the easiest and simplest protector I have seen and I am extremely impressed with it. When you purchase this from this company it comes with everything you will possibly need to put the tempered glass on. First it has you clean your tablet screen with a small alcohol pad then dry the phone screen completely with a small microfiber cloth (all included in package & it's designed for a one time use). Then next you can use the included dust sticker to remove any excess dust or fibers on the screen and you also have a option to use the included other stickers on the tempered glass so that it is easier to hold onto and line up correctly on your screen. The last step is to remove the film on the tempered glass and line it up correctly on the tablet screen (I have a iPad Mini & used the included stickers to line the holes on the protector to the home button & camera) and then used the included bubble squeegee card to get rid of any air bubbles it may have. However when I placed the protector on my iPad there was only 2-3 tiny bubbles and they were at the very corner of the screen where the protector was placed down last. I will never buy another brand or type of screen protector and I plan on telling everyone I know about this product.

"This is a top quality and secure waterproof case. I filled it full of air, put it underwater, and gave it a good squeeze. No air leaked out. (Air can escape a leaky seal much more easily than water.) I can see from the design of the product that the seal must be kept perfectly clean to work -- no stray grains of beach sand! Next was the float test. We enclosed our Galaxy S5 with some air cushion around it, sealed it, and floated it in a pan of water. No problem. Whether it floats or sinks is simply a matter of how much air you enclose. Anyone taking this bag diving should be able to take it to any depth, provided the air doesn't completely compress the air cushion around the phone. As long as there's cushion, the inside and outside pressures are the same, and the seal should have no net pressure on it. Divers should know what I mean. It might be a good idea to enclose a silica gel packet if the phone is to be taken into cool/cold water.We could use the touch screen underwater when air was in the bag. It was a bit fiddly, but it worked.We could also carry on a normal phone conversation with the phone in the bag. It didn't sound particularly muted. That said, our hearing lacks some of the higher frequency sensitivity younger people typically have.

"My review of The Hunger Games was a little negative due to the weak acting of the supporting cast, but that's vastly improved in Catching Fire. Director Francis Lawrence, who impressed me with I Am Legend, replaces Gary Ross, and I'm happy with the result. Lawrence will also direct the final two installments.As in the opening movie, Jennifer Lawrence is the key ingredient. Remove her from the project and it just wouldn't be as good. She rightly received an Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook, and has to show a whole range of emotions in Catching Fire. You'll see what I mean during the opening scene in which she has a flashback to events we witnessed in the previous movie. If I had to list the most promising actresses under the age of 30, Lawrence would clearly be right at the top. In fact, there are few actresses of any generation that I would rather watch.For the purposes of this review, I'm going to assume that you have seen the first installment. If you haven't, don't attempt to see Catching Fire before you know how the story begins. You'll miss some of the references for sure.We learned in The Hunger Games that victorious tributes could look forward to a better life. Hunger and poverty were supposed to be a thing of the past, and the fear of being asked to fight for survival could be removed forever. But it wouldn't be much of a sequel if Katniss just rode around waving to the crowds, would it? President Snow (Donald Sutherland) devises a scheme to get her in a new battle, only this time it's bigger and better than ever. Without giving away too much, let's just say that there are no tributes that are easy to kill in this sequel; those involved are generally older and more experienced.The different tributes aren't the only characters who are new to Catching Fire. Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) and his questionable facial hair has been replaced by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays Head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee. Hoffman gives a typical multifaceted performance, and the motivations of his character are hard to guess. During a conversation with Katniss, he claims to have volunteered for the position of Head Gamemaker, even though the life expectancy is not great. Does that mean that Seneca Crane wasn't the only one who was punished for disappointing President Snow in the past? Have other tributes caused trouble for Snow?The main difference between this sequel and the first installment is the depth of story and the quality of the acting. We learn a lot more about Katniss. Who does she love, and to what degree? What sacrifices must she make in her life to fit in and protect the people she loves. If you think about it, we all do similar things in our own lives. We socialize for the sake of our families or our careers, when a lot of the time we would rather spend our free moments pursuing things that we enjoy. Many of us give up things for our children or ailing relatives. We can identify with Katniss, even though we won't be asked to fight to the death. As for the acting, Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, and others, give the characters more depth than in the first movie. We are also given more information about Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Effie (Elizabeth Banks). I wonder how much of this is due to Simon Beaufoy's part in the screenplay? He's on a roll after writing Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.One of the best scenes comes early in the movie as Katniss and Peeta deviate from their prepared agenda during a tour of the other districts. Instead of mouthing the carefully prepared scripts, they choose to make a more meaningful contribution. I won't reveal what happens, but it's a memorable scene.The Capitol is portrayed as being particularly evil in this sequel, just in case you were in any doubt. Its dubious agenda is enforced by stormtroopers who look like they stepped straight out of Star Wars. Although some of the first 90 minutes is fairly predictable fare, I welcomed the chance to explore this world and its characters in more depth. It's hard to care about someone if you don't understand who they are, or what they are fighting for. Francis Lawrence did a great job of avoiding clumsy exposition in I Am Legend, and he avoids that trap in Catching Fire too. Instead of spelling out the reason for every little action, he allows scenes to naturally unfold so that we can see their significance for ourselves.Fans of action might be disappointed with Catching Fire. It takes a long time for the tributes to make it into the arena, and once there, they rely more on alliances than before. This story is more about teamwork and figuring out who is good or evil than it is about slaughtering everyone in sight. It's a richer story overall.Another reason for disappointment might be the abrupt ending. Like The Lord of the Rings, the story is split into several parts, and this second installment of four won't have a conclusion that neatly resolves all of the conflict. For that, you'll need to see the next two movies.I think that Francis Lawrence has improved upon the first installment significantly, and I'll be seeing how things pan out. I might even read Suzanne Collins' trilogy before I see Mockingjay Part 1 next year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MHTE28WLJMTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUS8M#wasThisHelpful","R2MHTE28WLJMTH","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big reader of science fiction, and Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series is probably my favorite. The only things that come close are Hyperion by Dan Simmons and Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga. I've read Ender's Game more than 10 times, including two or three occasions on which I finished it in a single sitting. One of my college papers is based on the novel and is published on Card's website.Yes, I'm a fan.So, as you can imagine, I have been looking forward to an Ender's Game movie long before I ever thought it might happen. For me, it had the potential to be the best science fiction movie ever made, if done well. After assembling a strong cast, my expectations could not have been higher as I sat down to watch the IMAX version today.The basic premise is that an alien race, known as the Formics or Buggers, invaded Earth fifty years ago. The invading fleet was defeated, but another attack is expected. In order to be ready to face a species that learns from its mistakes, the International Fleet has come up with a strategy: A program was established to observe the behavior of young children, hoping that the best young geniuses of the time would be able to become the top military strategists by the time they were needed. Ender Wiggin was chosen as one of the trainees.The movie deviates considerably from the book, but it's necessary. I am not here to tell you why the book is better, I'm here to tell you whether Ender's Game works as a movie. However, I must explain some of the key differences. In the book, Ender begins his training at the age of six, while all of the trainees in the movie appear to be 15 or older. I understand that it would be impossible to find dozens of 6-year-old actors capable of carrying this story. Also, the sequence of events is different. Bean, who is a key character, meets Ender immediately, rather than a few years into his training. Ender's training is supposed to take around eight years, but it seems to happen in months.The biggest weakness of the movie is the way the battle training is condensed. Again, I realize that few people would want to watch four hours of training, but some of the suspense is missing because so little time is devoted to key events. Some events in the book seem unfair to Ender, but without the background information, anyone who hasn't read the book will miss the significance. Whenever I read Ender's Game, I become Ender Wiggin and experience the satisfaction of his achievements. I'm glad to say that I experienced similar feelings during the movie.IMDB claims that the movie is an action movie, but that's not the case. Don't go into this expecting battle sequences or laser fights. They do exist, but not in the form you might expect. I am actually impressed that Hollywood didn't ruin the movie by trying to include too much action.Ender's Game is essentially about leadership, and why individuals choose to follow certain people. Everyone in the school is a genius, but Ender is a good leader because he gains the trust, loyalty, and even love of his followers. The book is full of tactics, and we see Ender and his army discover and develop skills over the course of several years. The armies are comprised of 40 soldiers who are typically split into four Toons of 10 soldiers during battle. I doubt a casual viewer will come away from this movie even knowing what a Toon is. We certainly aren't shown how Ender's Dragon Army uses tactics that are completely new. On the plus side, the ending could not have been better, and I was excited to see an important scene present and handled well.So, does this movie work at all?As someone who knows all of the background to Ender's story, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it come alive on the big screen. The acting was good and the special effects spectacular, although my Kiwi friend reliably informs me that Ben Kingsley butchered the accent. Most of the key events in the book are touched upon, and a fan of the series will automatically catch the references and fill in the blanks. A complete newcomer to the story will probably have a good time, but come away wondering why Ender's Game is often regarded as the best science fiction book ever written.I hope that the movie will be successful enough to spawn a sequel. Speaker for the Dead is a much deeper story, and shows what happens to Ender after the war. However, with some people boycotting the movie due to their dislike of Card's politics, I'm not sure whether a sequel will be possible.I'll be adding Ender's Game to my collection as soon as it is released on Blu-ray, but it would be wrong of me to automatically give it 5/5 just because I love the books. That said, it's a good attempt to make a coherent story out of very difficult material. It's hard to show people thinking. If you do like the movie and haven't read the book, I urge you to do so. I imagine it would considerably enhance any future viewings.By the way, the trailer gives away almost everything.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NQGPCSQD08IL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUNJQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NQGPCSQD08IL","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a huge Tom Hanks fan in the 1990s and the early part of the 2000s, but it's been a while since he turned in an exceptional performance. I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, but Hanks hasn't been great since Cast Away 12 years ago. After hearing the early buzz about Captain Phillips, I was hoping one of my favorite actors would return to peak form.Although Hanks didn't put a foot wrong, I came away a little disappointed. Let me explain why.We meet Rich Phillips (Hanks) as he is driving to the airport with his wife, Andrea (Catherine Keener). This introduction is somewhat brief, and Catherine Keener plays no further part in the movie. What it does do is allow us to see how Phillips prepares for a trip. He's aware of the dangers of piracy, but he's an experienced man.The next characters we meet are the pirates. This introduction is a much longer segment, and is extremely chaotic. We learn that life is hard for these Somali pirates and that they have bosses that they have to answer to. These people felt like standard villains to me, and we end up knowing little about them despite the length of time spent showing us their homeland. They talk in heavy accents when they do speak  English, and they have bad teeth. Yep, these are the people we are supposed to hate.Some of the most impressive scenes in the movie happen near the beginning as we see Phillips go about his routine. Hanks is particularly good at playing understated roles, and he's completely believable. The tone changes when the inevitable meeting with the pirates occurs. If you were to sit down and guess what kind of things might happen from this point, you would probably be pretty close. I know the movie is supposed to be based on real events, so I can't deduct points for lack of originality, but there aren't many surprises.I'm not going to delve into the plot beyond these scenes which all take place in the first 30 minutes. Anything more would venture too deeply into spoiler territory.Paul Greengrass also directed The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, which are among the best action movies I own. If you are familiar with those, it won't surprise you to learn that Greengrass employs similar techniques in Captain Phillips. He tries to enhance the action by showing extreme closeups and point of view shots, intended to place us right in the middle of the action. You can also expect to see plenty of shaky cam effects. Although this worked quite well, it will definitely annoy some viewers.Captain Phillips is a tense account of what can happen in dangerous waters. When you see all of the events transpire, you might be wondering whether it wouldn't be cheaper and safer to hire a few armed guards if you're transporting cargo through the region in question. The ultimate resolution was infinitely more expensive.I'm happy enough with Captain Phillips, and will be adding it to my collection, but I'm still waiting for a role meaty enough to extract another Oscar-worthy performance from Tom Hanks.

"Many people don't take science fiction seriously, but here's a movie that might work for those who don't usually like the genre. There are no aliens, unknown worlds, monsters, or laser shootouts. This is a movie that's set in the real world, or more accurately, above it.The story opens with a George Clooney voice-over. We meet astronauts working to repair a satellite. This shows how calm such a silent world can be. I reluctantly saw the movie in 3D, but this was one occasion that I came away feeling that it added to the experience. It almost made me dizzy seeing Ryan Stone (Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (Clooney) go about their routine business with Earth looming large in the background. Indeed, the cinematography was breathtaking throughout the 90 minutes.I don't want to give away too many details, but if you have seen the trailer or even looked at the poster, you'll know that this movie is far from being a calm ride. An accident sends debris racing toward the astronauts like some kind of deadly shrapnel. What follows is a story about the strength of the human spirit, and the will to survive against all odds. Remember that the word gravity has more than one meaning.While I enjoyed Sandra Bullock's performances in The Blind Side and Speed, I would hardly describe myself as a fan. However, I left the theater thinking that she carried the whole movie, and it's easily the most accomplished performance of her career.Alfonso Cuarón directed Y Tu Mamá También, Children of Men, and the best Harry Potter movie (Azkaban), but this is comfortably my favorite from his impressive portfolio. The story is lean, gripping, thoughtful, thrilling, scary, breathtaking, beautiful, and emotional, and feels perfectly paced at every point. He doesn't insult us by giving too much exposition, and that draws us deeper into the story. His use of extreme close-ups is another reason we are drawn to these characters. It's hard to avoid feeling that you are a part of the movie.As I watched, I thought of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Moon, Apollo 13, Cast Away, Alien, and a few other great movies. Cuarón lets us see his characters thinking, and that's a good thing. Remember that astronauts are not selected because they are stupid or incapable of adapting in extreme situations. I'm always impressed when I see a movie which takes the trouble to show how people really think. It's not an easy thing to do well. This choice works perfectly and helps the whole story succeed because it's so believable.Although the visuals dazzled on a regular basis, my favorite shot in the whole movie was Sandra Bullock in the fetal position. It jumped out at me as being so appropriate for the scene, and it was a stroke of genius. You'll know what I mean when you see it. The opening titles remind us that there is no sound in space, just as Kubrick depicted almost 50 years ago.I admire this movie so much that I would happily watch it again tomorrow. It's a wild 90 minutes. I left the theater feeling as if it was an effort to be back in the real world. I was totally immersed in the story to the point of being almost unable to function when it was over. I'm glad I had a long walk back to the car so that I could catch my breath.There are so many reasons to see this movie, even if you hate science fiction. It won't be forgotten when the awards season arrives. See it immediately. I would even go as far to say you should see it in 3D.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RL880OX7N9VY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIIGW#wasThisHelpful","R2RL880OX7N9VY","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of Tom Hanks ever since I saw Big, and I would say that it's the first Hanks performance that really made me aware that he could be more than someone who would only be remembered as a briefly popular comedic actor. Big is a comedy, but it contains plenty of scenes which rely on drama. It makes some good observations about childhood, friendship, relationships, and life itself.Josh Baskin (Hanks) is 12, and has a crush on someone at school. Unfortunately, he has no chance because her boyfriend can drive. After a failed attempt to sit next to her on a fairground ride, Josh makes a wish on a Zoltar machine; he wants to be big. A card informs him that his wish has been granted, and he wakes up the next morning as an adult. While that sounds like utter nonsense, it provides an opportunity to show how a child in a man's body might interact with the world.We see Josh convince his friend, Billy (Jared Rushton), that he really is who he says he is. The two form a plan to track down a Zoltar machine so that Josh can wish to return to normal. While the pair wait for the information to arrive, Josh has to support himself. He likes computer games and manages to talk his way into working as a data processor at a toy company. I guess finding a job was easier in 1988 than it is today?The genius of the movie is in showing us how simple life can be when you're a child. Most adults become jaded when they realize the reality of working, the daily routine, and the struggle to pay for all the little luxuries that they covet. Josh attacks the world with the exuberance of a child. He does everything quickly and to the best of his ability, and his enthusiastic approach draws the attention of the Mr. MacMillan (Robert Loggia), who owns the company.Josh is promoted fast, and is soon vice president of development. His apparent luck causes resentment among some of the employees, but Susan (Elizabeth Perkins) finds his approach attractive. The two enter into a relationship, but we can see that Josh doesn't have any idea how to behave around a woman who isn't his mother. Once again, his honest approach pays dividends, and Susan perceives his attitude as a refreshing change from the manipulative partner she last dated. In fact, his childish notions help unlock the child inside her, and she likes the feelings it evokes in her.The movie is definitely a feel-good piece, but it's more than just fluff. If you think about some of the messages, it's telling us just to take things at face value and enjoy life. Josh succeeds because he has no ulterior motives. We are regularly reminded about the importance of friendship, and how events in our lives can sometimes threaten our relationships with established friends when we find something or someone new that we think deserves our full attention. Of course, a good friend will forgive you for such indulgences.There have been so many movies about identity switches, and quite a few of them were made in the 80s. Big is better than all of the others because after the initial fantasy element, it contains a lot of incisive observations about human behavior. The casting elevates the movie to yet another level, and it's one I return to every couple of years.The story was written by Gary Ross, who had a hand in the writing of Seabiscuit, Pleasantville, and The Hunger Games. This is easily his best early effort and it deserves your time. The Blu-ray includes an extended cut, which adds 26 minutes to the movie, and it's my preferred version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YI0QZZYPNDZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001R10BEG#wasThisHelpful","R2YI0QZZYPNDZH","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 1960s saw a lot of social change. The hippie movement, the increased exposure of recreational drugs, and the idea of freedom were all on the rise. Easy Rider captures that time and tries to depict a feeling. For the most part, it succeeds.Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) star as two bikers who are riding across America on their choppers. We see them buying and selling drugs, and meeting up with other like-minded people. They are determined to leave behind the established system and make their own way in life. In a way, this is a road movie, but it's also much more.The biggest source of conflict in the movie comes in the form of people who see Wyatt and Billy as dangerous non-conformists. They are arrested on dubious grounds and receive verbal abuse from some of the townspeople they meet along the way.The story itself is actually pretty thin. This is a movie that is more about the lifestyle than the plot of its characters. The idea of communes and free love are not as shocking as when they first appeared, but imagine watching the ideas portrayed in this movie when it was released.Jack Nicholson shows up as lawyer George Hanson, who helps out our rebellious heroes when they find themselves locked up in jail. Nicholson's role is brief, but memorable. Hopper and Fonda do a great job of portraying the free-spirited bikers.Music plays a big part in the movie and helps to establish the 60s feel. Be ready for Hendrix, Steppenwolf, The Byrds, The Band, Roger McGuinn, and many other performers from the era. The other star is the American scenery. The mountain locations are particularly spectacular.The movie is dated now, but I found it enjoyable nonetheless. I would recommend it for people born in the 50s or before, as well as younger people who are curious about what life might have been like at the end of the 60s.The Blu-ray presentation from Criterion (in the America Lost and Found set) does a good job of restoring this important movie, and comes with commentaries and a choice of audio options.Overall score 3.75/5","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUNA6JKCZ8O8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0024FAG6M#wasThisHelpful","RUNA6JKCZ8O8S","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the day that I learned of the impending retirement of Hayao Miyazaki, I wanted to take the time to review yet another Studio Ghibli title. But before I do, I'd like to pay tribute to the great Japanese director.If I think about my favorite directors, Miyazaki would be high on the list. He might not be number one, but he's probably brought me more pure joy than any other director. Miyazaki has 11 features to his credit as a director, along with several shorts and TV series. He's also written screenplays for other Studio Ghibli directors, including Whisper of the Heart, From Up on Poppy Hill and The Secret World of Arrietty.All of those movies have the unmistakable Miyazaki feel. His films usually feature strong female characters, elements of fantasy, and a feeling of innocence and purity that is lacking in animated films from other studios. I'm happy that he can finally enjoy his retirement, but I'm sad that the upcoming The Wind Rises will be his last film.But let's talk about Kiki's Delivery Service.Although my favorite Studio Ghibli title changes depending on my mood, Kiki's Delivery Service is one of several titles from the studio that I would rate as perfect. Kiki (Kirsten Dunst) is a 13-year-old witch who is about to leave home for one year to further her training. She takes Jiji (Phil Hartman), her black cat, and finds a town where she can settle. Her mother makes potions, but Kiki is unsure what services she will provide, until an opportunity presents itself. She returns a pacifier to a young mother and realizes that she can make her living by flying all over town to deliver other items.Like most Ghibli worlds, the people in Kiki's new town are kind and generous. She's given a place to stay by Osono (MacNeille), who runs the local bakery. In return, she'll mind the store on occasion and deliver things for its customers. The locals are all impressed by her ability to fly, but it's her character that eventually charms most of them. She's simply a good person, and everyone she comes into contact with likes her.One boy. Tombo (Matthew Lawrence) develops a crush the moment he sees her, and tries to get to know her better as the story progresses. Like Hayao Miyazaki, Tombo has a fascination with flying. He's trying to build a machine that will do just that, and he's eager to show his work to Kiki.There are no villains of any kind, but the story does contain moments of peril. However, I would recommend Kiki's Delivery Service to anyone, whether they are four years old or over 80. It's the kind of movie that will make you smile right from the start, and keep delighting you throughout the 103 minutes. Phil Hartman has most of the best lines, and some of his remarks provide the funniest moments.I recently loaned the movie to a friend and her 5-year-old insisted on watching it three times. As soon as I got it back, I was compelled to watch it again myself.There is no North American Blu-ray at the time of writing, but you can import it from Japan if you require a Region A disc. It's also available in other parts of the world, including the UK (Region B locked). I suspect a North American release will happen next summer.I'll close by thanking Hayao Miyazaki for Kiki's Delivery Service and the many other memorable titles he has been involved with. I can't imagine another animation studio coming close to his lofty achievements.Overall score 5/5","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REAIP4XVS58HF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008TNCYSQ#wasThisHelpful","REAIP4XVS58HF","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of Studio Ghibli won't have had much chance to see From Up on Poppy Hill. It enjoyed a brief limited release in theaters a few months ago, but the Blu-ray release on September 3rd will allow many other fans to check it out. I've seen it twice over the past two days and I urge Ghibli fans to buy the Blu-ray.From Up on Poppy Hill looks like a Studio Ghibli film, and packs quite an emotional punch, but don't expect to see the fantasy element present in most of the studio's classics. This is more like Whisper of the Heart than Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro. The film is populated by good people doing good things, and there's not a villain in sight. It will appeal to anyone who remembers their childhood, school, young love, and friendship. Like most Ghibli films, it's full of great messages for us and our children.Umi Matsuzaki (Sarah Bolger) is an eleventh-grader, living in 1963 Yokohama; she takes care of her family and a few boarders while her mother is away studying in the US. She cooks and cleans while trying to maintain her good grades, and is a responsible young woman. One day in school, she meets Shun Kazama (Anton Yelchin). He performs a daredevil stunt to try to gain support for his campaign to save a clubhouse used by him and his friends. Umi and Shun form a friendship that is the heart of the film, but the story isn't quite so simple. This is not just a tale of teen romance; it's the story of a group of young people pulling together to achieve a common goal. Some of the twists are unexpected, and considerably more complicated than those found in typical animated fare.One of Umi's habits is to raise flags on the pole on her balcony to signal to ships passing in the harbor. I had better not reveal the reason for that, but it's far from trivial and will help you to empathize with her situation. Umi's world is constantly changing. Her small town has a real community feel, and it's common for people to be friendly and help one another in their daily lives. The bigger picture shows Tokyo preparing for the 1964 Olympics, so there's constant pressure to join modern society and leave behind some of the antiquated life that Umi is used to.One of the high points is seeing how the students work together to renovate their dirty old clubhouse, and the daring way in which Shun, Umi, and a friend attempt to get their message heard by someone who is actually in a position to make a difference.Some of the themes in From Up on Poppy Hill are pretty serious. I know that I have probably failed to capture the interest of many readers, because this is another Studio Ghibli film without significant conflict. Instead of an evil villain, we are shown some of the problems young people might face while growing up. One twist is heartbreaking, and I won't dare reveal it here. However, I will say that by the end of the film, the mood is extremely positive. Like all good dramas, there must be some challenges and heartbreak in order for us to appreciate the good things in life. When the film ended, I was smiling. I wish my world could be as idyllic and charming.I'm sure some of you are wondering about Goro Miyazaki's direction, and whether the future of Studio Ghibli is in good hands with Hayao Miyazaki's (72) retirement announced, and Toshio Suzuki (65) probably approaching the end of his career. Goro Miyazaki received plenty of criticism for Tales of Earthsea (2006), and openly admitted that he played it safe and didn't try to extend himself. From Up on Poppy Hill is a much stronger effort, and I hope it enables him to produce works of similar quality in the future. Hayao Miyazaki wrote the screenplay with Keiko Niwa, and I'm sure that it helps make the film feel familiar, and as warm as other Studio Ghibli entries.Many of the established Ghibli traits are present. I love that the female characters are so strong; something that Pixar could learn from. The importance of family, friendship, and mutual respect is always on display. The young and the old both have a place in the world, and they care about one another. Notice also the scenes involving food. I can remember so many similar scenes from other Ghibli films. Perhaps they are present to remind us how good something as simple as a pleasant meal can be? There's also an umbrella; it's amazing how often they appear in Ghibli's other worlds.Before I close, I must mention the Blu-ray special edition. Unlike most US Ghibli releases, this one is released by GKids and Cinedigm. The picture quality is wonderful, and the audio features both US and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.0 mixes. I was startled a couple of times by the immersive output from the rear speakers. The package includes a DVD, so you can introduce a new fan to Ghibli, and a rather informative 16-page booklet. Hayao Miyazaki talks about how the project originated, and Goro talks about his work on the film. The special features total more than three hours, and include the film in storyboard form, plus interviews with Goro Miyazaki and Hayao Miyazaki. For those who like to watch the film in the original language, the subtitles are white and unobtrusive.Ghibli fans, or anyone who cares about life, people, and good storytelling, should not miss this release.Overall score 4.5/5","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VBKYMTQQNJ9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CSYRHG6#wasThisHelpful","R2VBKYMTQQNJ9G","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most North Americans have either never heard of Audrey Tautou, or know her because she appeared in Amelie or The Da Vinci Code. The biggest hurdle is that the majority of her films are French, and I'm well aware that more than 90 percent of people can't stand subtitles. That's a shame, because Tautou is a fantastic actress. She's physically attractive, but her acting contains a depth of emotion that is even more beautiful. It's easy to root for her characters. Just look into those soulful dark eyes and see how much emotion she conveys without saying a word.Jean-Pierre Jeunet is an extremely quirky director, and his films have an unmistakable style. Think of him as a French version of Wes Anderson or Quentin Tarantino; at least in terms of humor. Although this film contains more serious subject matter than Amelie, that humor is still there. I usually watch it with a grin on my face and tears in my eyes.So, what is A Very Long Engagement about? Well, it's set during World War 1, and the first 15 minutes might lead you to believe that it's a war film, but it's actually an epic romance. How many guys have stopped reading already? It's in French and it's a romance! If you're the type of person who can't stand typical romances, don't worry. This film is much more than mere fluff. It has a deep story, with so many interesting characters that you might lose track of what is going on the first time you see it. Just watch what Jeunet does with the character of the postman. Jeunet is perhaps an acquired taste, but I strongly urge you to check out his work if you haven't thus far.Mathilde (Audrey Tautou) is 20, and she's in love with Manech (Gaspard Ulliel). She developed polio as a small child, and he was the only kid in school who was interested in talking to her. One flashback shows how they met, and how he captured her attention by offering to carry her on his back to the top of a lighthouse. Love comes in many forms, and I often wonder why two people end up together. It can be for all kinds of reasons, but it's clear as we see Mathilde and Manech come to know each other that their relationship is something very special. Unfortunately, it's interrupted when Manech is required to become a soldier. Jeunet doesn't romanticize war at all, so expect a few unpleasant scenes.The story continues as five soldiers, including Manech, are accused of trying to get out of fighting by deliberately wounding themselves. Rumors reach Mathilde that Manech is dead, but she refuses to believe it. Mathilde suffers a little bit from OCD, and a few scenes are all the more moving because of it.That's just the set up, and already it's becoming a complicated story. The remainder of the film shows Mathilde's attempts to discover the truth about Manech. Is he still alive? She enlists the help of a private detective to find out what happened.It's a superb performance from Tautou, and she's ably supported by some of Jeunet's regular actors, including Dominique Pinon, Ticky Holgado, and Jean-Claude Dreyfus. Marion Cotillard shows up as a glamorous assassin, who is intent on avenging the death of her lover. Jodie Foster has a small role, but her story is an important part of the whole, and it's an enjoyable sequence.It would be wrong of me to review this film without mentioning the wonderful cinematography. Its Oscar nominations for artwork and cinematography were most appropriate. Some of the war scenes are harrowing, but the film is also punctuated by moments of great beauty. The French countryside is one of the stars, and can be breathtaking at times.A Very Long Engagement is a visceral experience. You'll feel for Mathilde and Manech, and you'll laugh at Jeunet's sense of humor. Some of the best films transport us to a different place, and this is most definitely one of them. I won't reveal the ending, but it worked extremely well for me, and I feel a whole range of emotions every time I see it. I'll always remember the three Ms, the albatross, and my favorite scene as Mathilde tries to beat the car to the bend in the road.See this film!If you have the ability to watch Region B Blu-rays, the transfer on the imported version looks sensational. Subtitles are optional for those who need to know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20Q8Q1V2DWAE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XTHBIE#wasThisHelpful","R20Q8Q1V2DWAE4","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had read so many good things about Searching for Sugar Man, but something stopped me from watching it until yesterday. I was afraid that it just wouldn't be my kind of thing. Would I like the music? Probably not. Would I care about a musician that I had never previously heard of? Doubtful. Furthermore, only a select few documentaries have captured my imagination to the point where I would watch them more than once.I'm happy to report that all of my doubts were quickly erased within the first few minutes.Sixto Rodriguez was born in Detroit in 1942, and made two albums in the 1970s. The first, Cold Fact, was released in 1970, and Coming from Reality followed in 1971.His singing style was raw, along the lines of Bob Dylan and Neil Young. Like both of those artists, the lyrics carry a lot of meaning, and it's obvious that Rodriguez wrote songs that were both personal and authentic. His US sales were almost non-existent, and, like me, most people weren't aware that he existed before this documentary was put together.Here are a few of his lyrics:Climb Up on My MusicHave you ever had a feverFrom a bitter-sweet refrainHave you ever kissed the sunshineWalked between the rainWell, just climb up on my musicAnd my songs will set you freeWell, just climb up on my musicAnd from there jump off with meI'll Slip AwayAnd you can keep your symbols of successThen I'll pursue my own happinessAnd you can keep your clocks and routinesThen I'll go mend all my shattered dreamsMaybe today, yeah I'll slip awayThis is Not a Song, It's an Outburst: Or, The Anti-Establishment BluesThe mayor hides the crime rateCouncil woman hesitatesPublic gets irate but forget the vote dateWeatherman complaining, predicted sun, it's rainingEveryone's protesting, boyfriend keeps suggestingYou're not like all of the restGarbage ain't collected, women ain't protectedPoliticians using people, they've been abusingThe mafia's getting bigger, like pollution in the riverAnd you tell me that this is where it's atWoke up this morning with an ache in my headI splashed on my clothes as I spilled out of bedI opened the window to listen to the newsBut all I heard was the Establishment's BluesGun sales are soaring, housewives find life boringDivorce the only answer, smoking causes cancerThis system's gonna fall soon, to an angry young tuneAnd that's a concrete cold factThe pope digs population, freedom from taxationTeeny Bops are up tight, drinking at a stoplightMiniskirt is flirting, I can't stop so I'm hurtingSpinster sells her hopeless chestAdultery plays the kitchen, bigot cops non-fictionThe little man gets shafted, sons and monies draftedLiving by a time piece, new war in the far eastCan you pass the Rorschach test?It's a hassle it's an educated guessWell, frankly I couldn't care lessA couple of early interviews in the film report that Rodriguez committed suicide. One account states that he set himself on fire on stage, while another claims that he shot himself after his tiny audience ridiculed his performance. But this is not a sad tale; it's actually extremely uplifting. Please trust me on this.The film explains that Rodriguez was a huge success in South Africa, with a bigger following than Elvis or The Rolling Stones. He was completely unaware of this at the time, and never saw any of the money. His records were initially unavailable, but word spread after bootleg copies were distributed among fans. When the albums were finally released, more than half a million copies were sold. Imagine having all that success without being aware of it. It almost sounds like a hoax or a spoof documentary, doesn't it?In South Africa, people adopted some of the songs and made them part of the anti-apartheid movement. One fan decided to find out the truth about this mysterious man, and made it his mission to discover exactly what happened. He began by tracking where the royalties went, and also visited places mentioned in the songs. While on the verge of abandoning his search, a blog post gave him new hope and a fresh lead. I don't want to reveal what he ultimately found, because you deserve to find out for yourself if you don't already know how the story ends.This is a film for music fans, and for anyone who enjoys uplifting stories. I know that I haven't told you why you need to see Searching for Sugar Man, but you'll be glad you did if you do decide to check it out. It may be the best documentary I have ever seen, and I am already thinking about watching it again.It's not essential to view the film in high definition as much of the 1970s footage is low quality, but the recent interviews do benefit from the Blu-ray treatment, as does the sound quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29KH3O3HLTTNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUTUY#wasThisHelpful","R29KH3O3HLTTNK","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Every once in a while, a film is created by a visionary director at the top of his game, with memorable performances from some of the best actors working today, resulting in a cohesive, moving and powerful story that fully resonates with me.This is not one of those times.The Master is populated by unlikable characters who do nothing to redeem themselves at any point in the film.The bulk of the story takes place in 1950. Freddie Quell (Phoenix) is an able-bodied seaman who has trouble adapting to life after the war. He may have been mentally disturbed before that, but we aren't shown enough of his background to make that determination.We are shown something of Quell's attempts to hold down a regular job -- he seems to have a gift for photography -- but he's quick to anger and attacks one of his customers without apparent provocation. He's also an alcoholic, and we see him drinking all manner of questionable substances, some of which appear to be potentially lethal. When he's accused of poisoning someone with one of his concoctions, he seeks refuge on a ship.This is where the film gives the audience a glimmer of hope that it will develop into something interesting. This ship is run by Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), who claims to be a writer, doctor, nuclear physicist, theoretical philosopher, and a great many more things. Dodd is fascinated by human beings and psychology, and wants to understand Quell and help him with his obvious anger issues. Dodd has his own way of doing things and his psychoanalysis produces the most memorable scenes in the movie.Dodd is married to Peggy (Adams), but she's just as unpleasant as the rest of the characters. She barely had any lines, and most of the ones she did have were obscene.Quell frequently fantasizes about women, as outlined in an early masturbation scene on the beach with a girl fashioned out of sand. This theme is continued when he pictures women naked at a gathering.If this were a story about Dodd's quest to heal Quell, I might be satisfied with it, but the plot meanders along without any obvious conclusion.I consider myself a patient viewer, and I appreciate all manner of films that have slow plots, hidden messages, and flawed characters. Unfortunately, The Master left me disappointed.The final 30 minutes were thought-provoking. I found myself thinking whether I should walk out, and whether anyone would mind if I were to take off my right shoe and scratch my foot. I also wondered whether time was moving differently all of a sudden, and if this was the same Paul Thomas Anderson who gave is There Will Be Blood and Magnolia.The individual components of the film were mostly in place; the acting was fine, the cinematography and score worked, and Anderson presented a convincing picture of New York in the 1950s. What wasn't present was a coherent story or a reason to care about these miserable characters.I doubt that Amy Adams will ever work for Disney again after some of the words that came out of her mouth.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLZRSYMS2L2N8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008220DIC#wasThisHelpful","RLZRSYMS2L2N8","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been waiting for the release of Seven Psychopaths ever since I learned that Martin McDonagh was writing and directing. If you have seen In Bruges, you'll know that McDonagh has a dark sense of humor, not too far removed from something Quentin Tarantino might be involved with.Does Seven Psychopaths match the brilliance of In Bruges? Not quite, but it's still an entertaining movie.Marty (Farrell) is a struggling screenwriter, who has decided on little more than the title, Seven Psychopaths. The problem is, he wants his psychopaths to be Buddhist, and he can't see how they would go around killing people. He decides to make one Amish instead, for no particular reason. Marty doesn't have a clue about writing.His friends, Billy (Rockwell) and Hans (Walken), make money by dognapping and returning the animals to their owners in order to claim the reward money. This backfires when they inadvertently take a dog belonging to Charlie (Harrelson), who is some kind of crime lord. You only have to read the tag on the collar of his beloved Shih Tzu to understand Charlie's outlook on life.Seven Psychopaths is a comedy. It's also extremely violent at times, and has more than its fair share of foul language (including the word that almost every woman detests), with brief nudity and occasional racist remarks. But it's obvious that everything is tongue-in-cheek. It's almost impossible to mistake the movie for a serious drama; it's a fun ride, and the R-rated material does not seem offensive or out of place.I've already mentioned Tarantino, and for good reason. The genre and setting are almost irrelevant; this is an exercise in style, and you'll either love it or hate it. Dialogue is everything in this type of movie and most of the writing is inventive, witty and intelligent. The opening scene is reminiscent of Pulp Fiction, with two hit men talking nonsense. The scene ends in an unexpected way, and I won't reveal it here, but it sets the tone for the whole movie.McDonagh is aware of the course that Hollywood action movies are supposed to follow, and Seven Psychopaths challenges those expectations. One character suggests that they pitch a tent in the middle of the desert so they can just sit there and talk, rather than having a traditional shootout with the bad guys. In response, his friend asks whether this is a French movie. It's that kind of humor. Another interchange observes that women have a rough deal in this story; when they aren't being verbally abused, they are in danger of being removed permanently.I won't say any more about the plot because it's enjoyable seeing things gradually unfold on the screen, except to say that my favorite scene featured Hans making a suggestion about how to end the movie. Walken's comic timing is excellent as always, and his scenes are funnier when you think about some of the characters he has played in the past.The movie features good performances from Rockwell, Walken, Harrelson and Farrell in particular, although nobody else delivers a weak performance. The audience in my theater laughed often, and occasionally groaned at the unexpected violent scenes. If you go in expecting a dark comedy along the lines of In Bruges, Fargo, or The Guard, you'll likely enjoy the experience. The pacing feels just right.One thing I should add is that it's best to sit through the credits, or you will miss the final scene.I'm looking forward to the Blu-ray and the next McDonagh movie. It would be fun to see Brendan Gleeson involved too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y592OVS80I2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007REV4LQ#wasThisHelpful","R1Y592OVS80I2S","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew nothing about Taken when it was released in 2008, but it proved to be one of the best action movies I had ever seen. There was just enough information about the characters to care about them, and the action was intense and rather elegant.That shouldn't surprise me because Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen wrote the script. Besson had previously grabbed my attention with Léon: The Professional, which is one of the best action movies ever made. La Femme Nikita was another notable triumph. I mention all that to explain why I was already sold on the idea of Taken 2 as soon as it was announced.So, did it meet my lofty expectations?The opening scenes were something of a surprise with Brian Mills (Neeson) interacting with his ex-wife, Lenore (Janssen), and daughter, Kim (Grace) extensively. I like that we are shown how Mills has grown closer to Lenore. In the original movie, she was cold and spiteful, but the two are clearly on better terms now that Mills has used his skills to rescue Kim from her kidnappers. It made perfect sense and rang true for me.The plot is simple. If you remember Marko from the first movie, you'll probably know that he was part of an Albanian gang. In Taken 2, Marko's father is obsessed with avenging the death of his son. He's not interested in why Marko was killed, or that he was guilty of many crimes, he's only interested in seeing Mills killed. When Mills takes Lenore and Kim on vacation to Istanbul, Marko's father instructs his gang to capture Mills and his family. He partly succeeds, but Kim escapes.The opening setup is quite long and thorough, and I remember thinking that more than half the audience were probably anxious to see Neeson get on with the task of eliminating the opposition in as many unique and violent ways as possible. However, once the action starts, it's relentless and intense. We see car chases, shootouts, fights, threats, brief torture, and a rapidly increasing body count.Mills wants Kim to stay out of danger, but eventually enlists her help. I'm half expecting a sequel called 'Miss Taken.'It's unrealistic to expect a movie of this nature to be completely plausible. After all, the basic premise is that a 60-year-old man is capable of defeating gangs armed with automatic weapons. The method Mills uses to escape his kidnappers is so simple that I have to wonder why he didn't do it about 30 minutes earlier, but I'll forgive that.The ending was quite inventive, and paves the way for another sequel should Neeson and the cast want to reprise their roles a third time.I did have a few minor complaints, such as the kidnappers talking in English when it's obvious that they would stick to Albanian. Another minor annoyance was the use of shaky cam shots throughout most of the intense action scenes. There's a fine line between adding excitement and losing track of the events on the screen. The line was crossed a few times.Overall, I was happy with Taken 2. It delivered more of what I liked about the first movie and added depth to the relationships between the main characters. I don't think it's quite as good as Taken because we now know what Mills is capable of, and some of the pleasure of the first movie was seeing Mills demonstrate his unique set of skills for the first time.Taken 2 definitely works better if you have seen the first installment. Some of the actions and dialogue are direct references to events from the first movie, and you will miss some of the humor if you aren't aware of past events.Fans of Taken will be more than happy with this worthy sequel.Two things to remember:1) Never agree to go on vacation with Brian Mills.2) If Neeson uses your taxi cab, you probably won't see it in one piece again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CP3YEOFFDEGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0067EKYDG#wasThisHelpful","R1CP3YEOFFDEGX","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew that I wanted to see Trouble with the Curve without knowing anything about the plot. The reason? Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams are so likable. Eastwood claimed that he would never act again after making Gran Torino, but I'm happy that he changed his mind. Eastwood plays baseball scout, Gus Lobel, and his character is similar to Walt from Gran Torino in many ways. He's hard to get along with, even if you happen to be one of his close friends.One thing I should point out is that Trouble of the Curve is funny. Although it's tagged as a drama, there is a lot of humor in the movie. Eastwood has good comic timing and his character delivers one-liners at every opportunity. The audience in my theater laughed loudly and often. But the story also has the ability to move you emotionally. It feels somewhat like a James L. Brooks movie, such as Broadcast News or As Good as It Gets.Like Moneyball, Trouble with the Curve is about people more than it is about Baseball. Gus has three months left on his contract and with the exception of his friend, Paul (John Goodman), people are starting to wonder whether he's still capable of doing his job. He's a dinosaur, preferring to dig through a pile of newspapers for statistics, rather than rely on computers for the information. His boss (Matthew Lillard) wants to replace him.The thing is, there is some truth to the belief that Gus is struggling to do his job as a scout. His eyesight is failing and it doesn't go unnoticed. Paul pays him a visit and advises him of the situation, asking him if he has considered the future, but Gus won't listen. In desperation, Paul asks Gus's daughter, Mickey (Adams), to go on the road and help out her father with his latest scouting assignment. She's an ambitious lawyer, and on the verge of becoming a partner, but she agrees to squeeze it into her schedule and intervene.Adams is a talented actress and I've been waiting for her to get a meaty role after earning an Oscar nomination for her performance in Doubt. Her role in The Fighter was too brief to count. I've yet to see The Master, but I came away thinking this was the best Amy Adams performance in the past four years. I mentioned that she is likable, but she's also good at what she does. There's a certain intelligence and vulnerability to her characters that I find appealing, and it's present in Mickey. She appears successful on the outside, but she has never been close to her father.There are three main themes present in the movie:If you have seen Absolute Power, you'll know that Eastwood is convincing as a father who has a problematic relationship with his daughter. One of the keys to Trouble with the Curve is seeing how Mickey attempts to resolve her issues with Gus.The most obvious issue is with Gus, as old age threatens his livelihood. Director Robert Lorenz takes plenty of time at the outset to establish his characters, allowing us to get an idea of what is at stake. Is Gus washed up, or does he still have something to offer? I won't ruin that for you.The other main theme is the ability to decide what constitutes happiness. It's different for everyone. Are you happy because you earn a good salary and thrive in your career? What about personal relationships and family? How about having time to enjoy your life?It's clear that Gus is happy working as a baseball scout, but what isn't clear is how Mickey views her own life. Is she truly happy as a lawyer? Can she come to terms with the distance between her and her father? She's also romantically involved with a man who thinks of her as a commodity rather than as a woman he loves. He figures that they get along quite well and are both successful, so it would make sense for them to be together. He's not the most romantic of men.That's the setup. As you can see, there are a lot of issues at stake.One thing the movie does badly is make it obvious which characters you are supposed to root for, and who you should dislike. That flaw makes it easy to predict the outcome for Gus, Mickey, and at least three other minor characters. Those flaws aside, I enjoyed the pacing and the thorough characterization.If this turns out to be Eastwood's final acting role, it's not a bad way to finish. As for Adams, it is good to see her in a role which allows her to show that she can actually act. I should also mention Justin Timberlake, who plays a former baseball player and young talent scout. He's also interested in Mickey if she'll let down her defenses long enough.Trouble with the Curve isn't a great movie, but it's very good, and one that I want to own. It's a pleasure to spend time with the actors and the story has a lot of warmth. If you're a fan of Eastwood or Adams, I doubt that you'll be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R50D5M4P9Q400/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AMAK0E#wasThisHelpful","R50D5M4P9Q400","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Comedy is so subjective. Some people want American Pie, The Hangover, or the latest Eddie Murphy movie, while others prefer gentle indie comedies such as Little Miss Sunshine.What makes you laugh?I often think about my own sense of humor and it's difficult to pin down at times. I tend to avoid cheap laughs or things done for shock value, and I admire intelligent dialogue and quirky or original takes on everyday situations. One director who never fails to make me smile is Wes Anderson. He definitely falls into the quirky category, but there is so much more to his movies than that.Rushmore is Anderson's second movie, coming two years after his debut, Bottle Rocket. Both movies were written with Owen Wilson, and they have a similar feel. Anderson is one of those directors who appears to make movies about nothing and it's easy to sit there wondering what you just watched. But, unlike many comedies, there are deeper themes present. I usually find myself thinking about Anderson's work several days after I see the movie. That's the case this time, and it's the main reason I am writing this review.Rushmore stars Jason Schwartzman in his first role. He plays Max Fischer, who is a 15-year-old student at Rushmore, a private school. He's there because he wrote a play in second grade and won a scholarship. Most of the students have rich parents, but Max's father is a barber and Max has to lie and claim that he's the son of a brain surgeon in order to gain acceptance.Max is struggling at school and is informed that he'll be expelled if he flunks another class. His main problem is not one of intelligence, it's his lack of focus. He takes on so many extracurricular activities that he doesn't have time to work on his grades. We see snippets of Max indulging in each of these activities, such as beekeeping and fencing, and these snapshots give the movie a lot of charm. It reminds me of Amelie and some of Jeunet's other work in that regard.As usual, something feels odd in Anderson's world. This effect is heightened by the dialogue. For example, Max sounds as if he is much older. He talks so seriously and it's funny that someone of that age thinks the way he does. Watch him direct Serpico for the school play and you'll see just what I mean.The heart of the story involves an unusual love triangle. Max befriends Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who is a wealthy tycoon and former student of Rushmore. They both develop feelings for Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), who teaches at the school.I won't reveal any more of the plot, because it doesn't really matter. All you need to know is that Rushmore is a typical Wes Anderson film. He'll surprise you at times, make you laugh, and leave you wondering how he came up with such original ideas.I should also mention Mark Mothersbaugh, who began his association with Anderson on this film by contributing to the soundtrack. Other music used in the film includes songs by The Kinks, The Who, The Faces, and John Lennon. They all add to the nostalgic tone and fit perfectly.Owen Wilson doesn't appear in this one, but Luke and Andrew Wilson are both involved. If you appreciate quirky comedy, Rushmore won't disappoint.The Criterion Blu-ray offers a superb presentation. Colors are natural throughout and you'll feel as if you are standing next to the characters. The special features are also noteworthy and the highlight is a 55-minute feature showing interviews with Murray and Anderson on the Charlie Rose Show. Fans of commentaries will be happy that Anderson, Owen Wilson and Schwartzman appear on the commentary track.If you are curious about the appeal of Wes Anderson, Rushmore isn't a bad starting point. It won't work for everyone though.Overall score 4.5/5","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H9IXJSHYUELL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HK13SG#wasThisHelpful","R3H9IXJSHYUELL","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Top 5 films at the box office (worldwide) this year are: The Avengers ($1.5 billion), The Dark Knight Rises ($1 billion), Ice Age: Continental Drift ($836 million), The Amazing Spider-Man ($744 million) and The Hunger Games ($645 million). In the US, The Hunger Games ranks third behind The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises. It's clear that comic book heroes sell, and other key elements are action and conflict. The Hunger Games aims to give us a new fantasy hero to follow after the conclusion of the Harry Potter franchise.Does it succeed?The movie is an adaptation of the first part of a trilogy, written by Suzanne Collins, which was initially aimed at young adults. But, like the Harry Potter series, the trilogy appeals to readers of all ages. I can't comment on the quality of the books because I haven't read them, so I don't know how faithful the movie adaptation is. All I can judge is how well the story works on the big screen. The second movie in the series is set for a 2013 release, while the final part of the trilogy will be split into two movies. So, to answer my question, The Hunger Games is a resounding success as a financial venture and it's enormously popular.Financial success is one thing, but is the movie worth your time? I guess that depends on what you find entertaining. Let me describe what you can expect.***Spoilers ahead***The story opens with a glimpse into the life of Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence). We learn that she lives in one of the poorest of twelve districts in Panem, and that food is scarce. She feeds her mother and sister by hunting for game in the woods and she's a gifted archer. The twelve districts hold a lottery each year to select a boy and girl to represent them. The 24 children will fight to the death and only a single victor will survive. When Katniss sees her young sister chosen, she volunteers to take her place. The chosen boy from District 12 is Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson).That's all we are told about life in District 12. This is not a drama in which we learn about the struggle to live under such a regime, it's more of an action movie. The story moves on quickly and we are shown the sharp contrast between District 12 and the Capitol, where the population is wealthy and the games are seen as nothing more than a form of entertainment. Katniss and Peeta are interviewed on television by host Caesar Flickerman (Tucci). The Capitol is presented as weird and decadent, and most people look like extras from Amadeus. One character looks to be based on Rita Skeeter from Harry Potter. I had the impression that these people were weird for the sake of being weird and it didn't feel convincing.The movie plays out like an American version of Battle Royale with elements from The Running Man added for good measure. Those in control of the game can intervene at will using computers. Sometimes they will send medicine, while at other times they will harm or kill some of the contestants. It's all a grotesque manipulation aimed at entertaining the population in the Capitol.Director Gary Ross is a gifted storyteller, and he also has writing credits for Big, Pleasantville, and Seabiscuit. Unlike all three of those movies, I found that The Hunger Games lacked depth. It's obvious why I am supposed to root for Katniss as she risks her own life to save her sister, but there aren't enough background details to make me connect with her strongly. It felt more like a cynical plot device than anything that was remotely real.So, for me, The Hunger Games became something of a comic book. There is an attempt at showing group dynamics. Who will work together? At what point will they try to kill each other? Who will take their chances alone? What skills will each of the characters have? How inventive will the deaths be? But the attempt is flawed because some of the most dangerous contestants are displayed as sneering idiots, and it detracts from the seriousness of the situation. This is supposed to be a battle for survival, not a comedy?I'm trying to give a balanced review, but some of the battles are rather silly. That's not to say that the movie doesn't have a few good moments. One alliance in particular did resonate with me and I reacted emotionally to the death of one character.My overall impression is one of sadness. Not because of the death of some of the characters, but at what we are becoming as a society. Do we really need to see children fight to the death in order to be entertained? As with modern comedies, we are relying more on shock value than good writing. Katniss Everdeen was portrayed well by a promising actress, but original ideas were few and far between. You know almost exactly what to expect from The Hunger Games before it begins, and most events are thoroughly predictable.The next three movies will be a huge success, I am sure, but I'm not anxiously awaiting their release. I'm glad that I avoided The Hunger Games in theaters and waited to borrow the Blu-ray from a friend. Don't label me as a prude or someone who is against violence in movies. One of my favorites is Kill Bill, but, unlike the portrayal of Katniss Everdeen, I was shown enough background to care about what happened to The Bride.This movie does have a huge audience as I outlined at the beginning. If you are the kind of moviegoer who enjoys action, good presentation, and special effects, The Hunger Games will entertain you. You'll need to switch your brain off for a couple of hours, but movies like this do have their place. I guess that's why they get made. I am left wondering about the book and how much was left out. Don't let this review stop you from buying the Blu-ray (which looks and sounds fantastic) or checking out the movie for yourself. I'm clearly in the minority on this one.(9/29/13 Edit to add: After seeing this movie for the second time, I eventually ended up buying it. It seems that I was in the wrong mood the first time I saw it. Jennifer Lawrence is very good in the role and I am planning to see the sequels and maybe even read the books. I upgraded my rating to 3.75/5).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NF7J5H91SPWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084IG7KC#wasThisHelpful","R1NF7J5H91SPWF","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*This review contains spoilers*I would struggle to make a list of Woody Allen films that I don't like at all. I laugh at slapstick efforts like Sleeper, and it's easy to watch Annie Hall or Play it Again Sam from the same period. Recent efforts have changed in tone considerably and critics seem to love one effort and dislike the next. I'm one of the few people who enjoyed You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, and I believe that Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Midnight in Paris are two of the best films Allen has made in his entire career.So how does To Rome With Love measure up?I would say pretty well. As with most Allen efforts, the cast stands out. The film consists of four stories and each segment is worth your attention. I found myself laughing often, and that's quite rare.One story stars Jerry (Allen) as an opera director who is ahead of his time. One of his productions was performed by actors dressed as white mice. He visits Rome with his wife (Judy Davis), to meet their daughter's fiance. Jerry's creative juices start flowing when he overhears the fiance's father singing in the shower and he attempts to persuade him to star in a future production. Although this segment has a rather predictable outcome, Allen has plenty of amusing dialogue.Perhaps the most interesting of the stories is the one focusing on Jack (Eisenberg). He's an aspiring architect and lives with his girlfriend, Sally (Greta Gerwig). His life is turned upside down when Sally asks her friend, Monica (Page), to stay with them for a while. I have to admit that Ellen Page can do no wrong in my eyes. I was captivated by Juno and look forward to everything she is involved with. I was particularly eager to see what Allen would do with her in their first collaboration together. My only complaint is that this segment wasn't longer. Eisenberg plays a young neurotic type that Allen would have played in the 1970s. I find Eisenberg a little annoying at times, but I enjoyed his scenes here. The story was improved considerably by the presence of Alec Baldwin, who plays an older, wiser version of Jack. He gives him advice throughout, and his one-liners steal the show. This technique, which breaks the fourth wall, is one of the most enjoyable things about the film.The third segment tells the story of two young newlyweds, Antonio and Milly. The couple invite Antonio's parents to meet Milly, but she has become lost in the city. Instead, they meet Anna (Cruz), who is a prostitute who was meant to meet someone else, but ended up at Antonio's door. Antonio panics and asks Anna to pose as his wife. This is a pretty funny sequence and it gets better when they encounter Milly, who unwittingly has an adventure of her own. This part of the story is in Italian, so be prepared to read subtitles.The final story is the weirdest of the four, but it probably made me laugh more than the others. We meet Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni). He's boring. He does the same thing every day, wakes up at the same time, passes the same neighbors, and does the same boring tasks in his boring job. Even his wife looks bored when they are in bed together. One morning, Leopoldo is engulfed by photographers and journalists as he leaves for work. He assumes they have the wrong man, but they are fascinated by him and want to know the smallest details about his mundane existence. He is even asked to appear on TV. Bemused at first, Leopoldo warms to the task, eventually coming to appreciate his fame. Then, just as suddenly, it's gone. I'm sure Allen is commenting on the way the media reacts in modern society, making unremarkable people briefly famous. Did he have reality TV in mind, I wonder?The whole mix is enjoyable and a pleasure to watch. Writing this, I wish I could see it again right now. One minor complaint is that each story was given a complete resolution and it felt a little cumbersome. I wouldn't have minded if the characters had continued on with their lives and left me wondering a little.If you are a fan of Woody Allen, it's hard to believe that you won't like To Rome With Love. No, it's not as good as Midnight in Paris, but it's still better than most of the movies released this year. Don't be put off by the critics. See it and make up your own mind. Which European city will Allen take us to next year?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37HPB0AOZ3PL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUTCM#wasThisHelpful","R37HPB0AOZ3PL","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm losing count of the number of foreign films I've discovered that I would like to show to friends. Unfortunately, the vast majority would not subject themselves to a subtitled film, so this review will have to be my outlet. Maybe it will persuade one person, somewhere, to watch this wonderful film?I first saw Everlasting Moments on cable about two years ago. Although I admired it, I felt that it dragged a little at times and I awarded it 3.5/5. I don't know whether my tastes have matured significantly since that time, but I was captivated by last night's viewing on Criterion Blu-ray.The story tells the true story of Maria Larsson (Heiskanen), who is distantly related to members of director Jan Troell's family. It opens in the first decade of the 1900s and ends in the early 1920s. The story is narrated by Maria's daughter, Maja, and the story is based on her real memoirs.What can you expect from Everlasting Moments?The story shows life in Sweden approximately 100 years ago. It's a brutally honest portrayal of poverty and hardship, and how Maria found an escape from that gritty existence through her photography. We are told at the outset that Maria won a camera in a lottery. The ticket was purchased by Sigfrid Larsson (Persbrandt), and he thought the camera should be his because he bought Maria the ticket. She told him that he would have to marry her if he wanted to share it, so he did.Sigfrid is a complicated character. We discover that he is an alcoholic, and that he also has a weakness when it comes to other women. He appears to love Maria, but he's a violent man when under the influence of drink, causing all manner of problems for Maria and their children.Maria's life changes when she discovers the camera in a closet one day and decides to pawn it for food. She takes it to a local photography store and encounters the owner, Sebastian Pedersen (Christensen). Maria has no idea of the camera's value, but Pedersen tells her that it is a good one. In fact, he's not completely sure of its value either. He tells her that he will buy it, but that she should keep it and use it until he establishes its value. The cost of the chemicals and photographic plates will be deducted from the price when he eventually buys it. Maria begins to use the camera and discovers that she likes it. Pederson admires her work and thinks she has real skill.Have you ever uncovered a talent of your own that you never knew you had? That is part of the magic of Everlasting Moments. We live in a world where people are very guarded and often reluctant to show anyone a glimpse of their true feelings. Most reactions we see in others in a social setting are fake to some degree. They feign interest in what you are saying and force themselves to laugh or smile. It's rare to see genuine delight, and when I see it, I remember it. It's more common to see honest reactions from children because they don't care so much about how others perceive them.I mention all this to illustrate the power of Maria's reaction when she realizes that she has a talent for photography. It is pure magic to her and Maria Heiskanen captures that feeling and depicts it perfectly. It's so effective that I felt everything that Maria might feel and I began to connect deeply with her character and her situation.Although Maria doesn't boast about her talent or think that it's special, she begins to draw the attention of her friends and acquaintances. Photography was not common 100 years ago, so Maria finds that some people are willing to pay for her work and commission her to do more.Like all of my favorite dramas, Everlasting Moments takes the time to establish its characters. Maria ultimately has seven children and we learn about what is important to the older ones. Sigfrid does his best to be a good father and husband, but it's not really enough for Maria. However, she takes marriage seriously and we see that she isn't the kind of woman to cheat, even when she observes Sigfrid openly flirting with other women.Maria develops a deep friendship with Sebastian, which develops as she visits his store more regularly. This relationship is arguably the very heart of the film. Will Maria be tempted to abandon her husband or break her marriage vows?It's also interesting that Sigfrid is jealous of Maria's relationship with Sebastian, even though he only ever suspects that something might be going on. He conveniently overlooks the fact that he is involved with other women himself and sees it as completely insignificant. He holds Maria to a higher standard of behavior.I won't reveal the whole story or the ending, but some of the subject matter may disturb a few viewers, even though there is no nudity or bad language. It's a realistic portrayal of Maria's life, and that inevitably leads to a few scenes that are hard to watch.If you enjoy character studies and seeing how people might have lived a century ago, Everlasting Moments might be for you. The Blu-ray presentation is excellent and exactly what you would expect from Criterion. The special features include a look at Jan Troell's career in film (61 minutes), and two documentaries on the film and Maria Larsson's story (29 minutes and 10 minutes). There's also a 20-page book which includes an essay about the film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XB0PPBUMF4DZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E0YU0Y#wasThisHelpful","R1XB0PPBUMF4DZ","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Harry Potter franchise recently ended after the seven books were transformed into eight movies. Sorcerer's Stone (also known as Philosopher's Stone) was the first entry. It did well at the box office, grossing $975 million worldwide, and was the most successful entry until the final installment in the series beat it in 2011. The eight films grossed $7.7 billion worldwide, so they are enormously popular.Due to the popularity of the franchise, I'm going to assume that you have read J. K. Rowling's books, seen the movies, or both, so this review will contain spoilers. If you have never entered the world of Harry Potter, stop reading now.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was directed by Chris Columbus, who was responsible for Mrs. Doubtfire and the first two Home Alone movies. The tone of this first Harry Potter movie is quite similar to those three, relying on whimsy and comedy rather than drama. That matches the tone of the book, so it is not a criticism. If you had read the first book, like me, you were probably looking forward to seeing the world of Harry Potter portrayed on the big screen. The adapted screenplay by Steve Kloves didn't disappoint.There's a lot to like about Sorcerer's Stone; the sets are vast, the important story elements are present, and the majority of the young actors do a good job. It's a tricky business casting children who have to develop over the course of a decade, but I don't find myself disliking any of the choices. It's great to see Hogwarts, the Hogwarts Express, Gringotts, Diagon Alley, and Quidditch brought to life.Sorcerer's Stone starts slowly and might seem overly long, but it's necessary to introduce the characters and the worlds they inhabit. I could imagine some people viewing this first installment and giving up on the franchise, but that would be a mistake. This is a vast story which starts off as a charming fantasy before quickly becoming much darker in tone. In a way, it mirrors childhood. We are initially fascinated with the world until we mature and realize that it does have plenty of problems. As the series progresses, the films grow more serious as the threat of evil increases.Some of the best moments include Harry first learning about the existence of Hogwarts, his initial flying lesson, and seeing the teachers demonstrate some of the spells that the children will learn. The main characters are fully realized and know a lot about them by the end of the movie.Sorcerer's Stone is a good blend of fantasy and action, with the final part of the film containing the most dramatic sequences as our three heroes try to recover the Philosopher's Stone. The music used in the movie is excellent, and the main theme itself suggests a magical setting. There are a lot of important themes in the series and I think it's generally a good example for children. The importance of friendship is one of the major messages and it all begins with the relationships between Harry, Ron and Hermione.The Harry Potter franchise isn't just for children. I'm 50 and I have worked my way through the books and the eight movies several times. The adults in the story are played by some of the finest British character actors. Can you imagine anyone other than Alan Rickman as Snape? Dumbledore was played by Richard Harris in this movie and the sequel, and I think I prefer his version to Michael Gambon's portrayal, although Gambon's version did work for the more serious tone present in the other movies.There's a whole generation of people who grew up loving Star Wars, but here's a franchise for the next generation. Sorcerer's Stone is funny and lighthearted compared to later entries in the franchise, but don't let that deter you from watching all eight movies. The adequate acting improves considerably as the children age throughout the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R210BIJW1URUO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W74EQC#wasThisHelpful","R210BIJW1URUO1","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I almost went to see Safe House in the theater, and barely resisted the urge to blind-buy the Blu-ray, and I'm glad that I waited. After borrowing the movie from a friend, I know that I saved myself $20.It's not that Safe House is terrible, it's just formulaic, mediocre, and badly-written.The basic story is built around Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who looks after a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. The job involves a lot of sitting around, but he springs into action when he learns that Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a rogue CIA agent, has been captured, and will be delivered into his custody. When a recovery team, led by Agent Kiefer (Robert Patrick), is attacked and defeated, Weston is left to bring Frost in himself.Weston is ambitious and wants to work at a more high profile location, but he's young and unproven in the eyes of his bosses. We are shown how he is regarded during an exchange involving his superiors, Barlow (Brendan Gleeson) and Linklater (Vera Farmiga), at HQ.Imagine you were given the chance to write the screenplay. How would you make it stand out from previous entries in the genre? We have seen this subject handled well in the Bourne series, and reasonably well in Salt. Safe House doesn't belong in the same class.What's wrong with the movie? The excellent cast is virtually ignored. Instead of establishing the characters and giving them depth, we are given very little background information. The front cover promises an adrenaline rush, and that's all that we are given. If you love action movies and don't care about the plot, Safe House delivers. But if you want to know why these events are occurring, it's not exactly an important part of the mix. There's a lot of gunfire, but meaningful dialogue is at a minimum.If I had the pleasure of directing actors like Washington, Farmiga and Gleeson, I would make use of their abilities. Washington doesn't put a foot wrong, he's just given nothing to work with. Farmiga's screen time is extremely limited, but remember how effective she was in a similar role in The Departed? Gleeson is one of a kind and excelled in movies such as In Bruges and The Guard, but his character has no depth in Safe House. I see this as a wasted opportunity.In the Bourne movies, we see how Jason Bourne meets his girlfriend, and how that relationship becomes meaningful. When she is threatened, we feel his pain and we react. Weston's girlfriend in Safe House may as well have been a cardboard cutout, and as a result, we feel nothing when he examines their relationship.Safe House focuses on the action element. You'll see shootouts, car chases, explosions and people running. You might even understand why all this is happening, even though it's just a by-the-numbers screenplay. The movie grossed over $200 million and you won't scream for your money back, but I wouldn't bother buying the Blu-ray unless you are an action junkie. I love the cast, but against my expectations, I'm severely disappointed by the end result. Watch Bourne again instead, or watch Anton Corbijn's, The American, as that actually has some fresh ideas.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHBZ68TIT620R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIGSC#wasThisHelpful","RHBZ68TIT620R","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pixar has produced some of the best animated films ever made, and even the worst offerings are better than the work of most rival studios. However, after seeing trailers for Brave, I found myself wondering whether it would live up to my expectations. People running into walls or being hit in the groin are usually there to get a few cheap laughs and I expect more from a Pixar movie.I shouldn't have worried.Brave is aimed at a younger audience than Pixar's best work like Ratatouille and Up. Although it does contain deeper themes, such as conflict between mother and daughter, and dealing with society's expectations, the story is easy to follow. There were quite a few small children present in the theater when I saw the movie and I could hear them laughing and curiously asking questions about the characters. It also worked for me, and I'm by no means a small child.A few of the action scenes and some of the scenes set in the dark forest might worry very young children, but I don't think there's anything frightening enough to stop anyone seeing Brave.Those who were complaining that Pixar hasn't featured a female protagonist finally have a reason to celebrate; Merida (Macdonald) is featured heavily throughout, and she's a princess, although not in the traditional Disney style. You will hear a couple of songs, and there is a witch in the story, but Brave is not simply rehashing the formula exhausted in Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. Instead, Merida is like a tougher version of Rapunzel from Tangled.Brave is a coming-of-age tale set in ancient Scotland. The main clan-leaders all have sons, and Merida is expected to marry one of them. Unfortunately, she doesn't feel ready for marriage and wants time to discover how she feels about adult pursuits. All she really wants to do is enjoy her childhood, ride her horse, and practice her archery. This is essentially a story about a girl trying to change her fate.Some of the supporting characters are funny. Her potential suitors are an interesting bunch of misfits, and they supply a few laughs early in the story. Merida's three younger brothers appear regularly and are used in very inventive ways.Be prepared to hear Scottish accents throughout the movie. It reminded me somewhat of How to Train Your Dragon in that respect. I didn't find myself rooting for Merida as strongly as I rooted for Remy in Ratatouille because the outcome never really felt in doubt. Although Merida faces considerable peril, I never suspected that things would end badly.The voice acting was particularly good. Merida's father (Connolly) stole a lot of scenes and was the source of much of the humor. Kelly Macdonald did well as Merida and kept her likable, even though some of her actions were misguided. I also noticed how effective Patrick Doyle's score was. Unlike most Pixar movies, Brave is full of action, and the music enhanced those sequences considerably.The opening five minutes provided some of the strongest scenes in the movie as we were able to see Merida as a small girl and the relationship she had with her parents. Other magical moments included her encounter with will o' the wisps in the forest. Both of these elements reminded me of Studio Ghibli works, but Brave couldn't maintain that high standard for the whole movie.What we are left with is an enjoyable 90 minutes with plenty of laughs. There's less substance than that found in the best Pixar movies, but it's still a worthy addition and I will buy the Blu-ray when it is released. The overall look of the animation does match Pixar's excellent standards and it's hard to imagine it looking any better. Be prepared for a few cheap laughs, but don't miss it in theaters. I saw the 3D version and I don't think it added anything to the experience, so stick to the 2D version if you want to save a few bucks.I was pleasantly surprised by the full movie after being disappointed by the rather formulaic trailers. I should also mention that La Luna, the latest short from Pixar, airs immediately before Brave. That's well worth your time too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MKNHN07OT14V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAII08#wasThisHelpful","R1MKNHN07OT14V","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had the pleasure of seeing Prometheus twice. The first occasion was my first exposure to IMAX/3D and it was easily the best presentation I have ever seen in a theater. That prompted me to share the experience with two UK friends who were in town for my 50th birthday. Yes, I'm old.The most difficult thing to overcome when reviewing Prometheus is separating the incredible presentation from the story. Should I review the experience, or just the movie itself? I have chosen to comment on both elements.The opening shots immediately draw you in and establish that you are about to witness something special in terms of presentation. As the camera pans over the surface of a moon, you are part of the experience. As with Avatar, you are transported to a different world. The first shot of the ship is also effective, with the roar of the engines. Kubrick would probably turn over in his grave at the technical error of portraying sound in space, but it does add something for the viewer.Prometheus is quite ambitious. It does a good job of explaining some of the events that led up to the mission in Alien. We are shown some of the discoveries which prompted the Weyland Corporation to explore deep space. A crew is sent to search for an incredible secret, which I won't reveal here. Unlike other films in the Alien franchise, the presence of an android is explained from the beginning. David (Fassbender) is accepted for what he is without anything being hidden. The one thing that does remain consistent is that the android knows more than he admits. Where did he get that information?There is more than one alien species present in Prometheus, plus the humans. The story explains the origin of the type of ship discovered in Alien and we experience a small thrill of recognition. Ridley Scott balances new information with previous events in an effective way. I came away feeling like I knew a lot more about this universe, but I didn't feel that the original film had been betrayed in any way.It took me several viewings over a number of years to raise my rating for Alien to 4.5/5. Perhaps because I know that film so well, Prometheus had more of an immediate impact. However, there is one thing preventing me from rating the film as highly. The character of Fifield (Sean Harris) is a blatant flaw in the film. He's a British geologist with the personality of an idiotic criminal. He's clearly intended to provide comic relief, and I admit that the audience did laugh at his comments during both viewings, but his inclusion felt so out of place. Up until that point, the film had me fully engaged. The story seemed plausible and interesting. Fifield would never have passed any serious attempt at psychological screening by the Weyland Corporation and would never have become part of the crew in any realistic scenario. His inclusion pulled me right out of the movie as soon as he spoke his opening dialogue. His scenes with Millburn (Rafe Spall) were all ludicrous and I'm forced to deduct half a point just because of their presence.Everything else worked.I'm not against the idea of humor in a serious movie. Vickers (Theron) and Janek (Idris Elba) did have an amusing exchange which was handled in a far more intelligent manner. Theron played her part well and her icy personality was believable.The highlight of the film for me was the unexpectedly wonderful performance from Noomi Rapace. I liked her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the original Dragon Tattoo trilogy and was pleasantly surprised to see her tackling a role in English. Like Alien, the movie ends with a fight for survival, and Shaw (Rapace) is the equivalent of Ripley. There's one sequence which made me laugh because it was so outlandish, but Rapace played it totally straight and still had me on the edge of my seat and rooting for her. This will upset some people, but I think she was a more effective character than Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. I like both tremendously, so I guess it doesn't matter.Prometheus delivers in terms of story, action, and special effects, and most of the acting is good. The conclusion left the possibility of a sequel and I wouldn't be sorry to see that happen. It's always tricky when a franchise is continued after a long absence, but Scott really pulled it off. See it in IMAX/3D while you can and buy the Blu-ray when it is eventually released.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZFUHW3KH92S3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIHY0#wasThisHelpful","RZFUHW3KH92S3","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***This review contains spoilers***I have to admit that I hadn't seen any Wes Anderson films until two or three years ago and Moonrise Kingdom is the first that I have had the pleasure of seeing in the theater.My first Anderson experience was Bottle Rocket, and it didn't strike me as remarkable the first time I saw it. However, I found myself thinking about it over the next few days and ended up buying the Criterion Blu-ray.I think there are a couple of important things to understand about Anderson's films:The first is the level of detail. It's an assault on the brain and I've come to appreciate subsequent viewings more than with most films. Many lesser comedies fall flat because they run out of ideas and end up repeating them until they approach 90 minutes. Anderson's films have so many ideas it's ridiculous, but five of his seven films are also over by the 94-minute mark. The difference is that they are crammed with ideas and feel fresh and original.The other major thing to note is the brand of humor. Call it offbeat or quirky, or whatever you like, but it's certainly distinctive. It's the type of humor that uses a phrase or situation which is familiar to you, but surprises you by giving it a different meaning. Think of Police Squad, Naked Gun, or Monty Python, and you'll understand what I mean. Like David Lynch, I think Anderson's mind makes unusual connections that most are incapable of. In order to appreciate his films, you need to investigate all of his worlds and understand the way that he thinks. It might be too much work for the casual viewer.Let's get to Moonrise Kingdom.The film is set in the 1960s on a small island off New England. It evokes a sense of nostalgia that's present throughout. This is a time in which cell phones and most electronic entertainment didn't exist. Take a look at the primitive record player for example. The story focuses on the budding romance between Sam (Gilman) and Suzy (Hayward). Sam is a scout and invites Suzy to run away with him, causing the small town to send out a search party.The supporting cast includes some big names and a few Anderson favorites. The local cop is played by Bruce Willis and he's particularly effective in the role. The Scout Master is played by Edward Norton, who has an exaggerated sense of his own importance. He provides a lot of the humor in the few scenes he is in. Look out for the homage to The Shawshank Redemption when he discovers that Sam is missing.Frances McDormand and Bill Murray play a married couple and both are lawyers. Jason Schwartzman's appearance is brief, but he makes good use of the time. One of my favorite characters is played by Tilda Swinton, and she is simply referred to as Social Services. Even Bob Balaban's narration is funny. It's hard to go into any more detail without ruining the entire plot, such as it is, so I'll stop there.I mentioned that Anderson's films require several viewings to take in all the details, but I have to say that Moonrise Kingdom had an immediate impact on me. This is my style of humor and it felt like a Coen brothers movie, such as Burn After Reading, at times. Nothing much happens, but it's the style that's important. If you like Anderson's other films, you will almost certainly appreciate this.I sometimes wonder what kind of childhood Anderson had. Are these characters based on his own experiences? Most are intelligent and suffered something of a troubled upbringing. When I think of Sam, or Max (from Rushmore), am I seeing the way Anderson views his own early life? Dysfunctional families are a favorite topic of his and Moonrise Kingdom is filled with them. Perhaps I had such an immediate connection to the film because it felt familiar after seeing his other work?I'll close by saying that Anderson's films won't have universal or even large appeal, but if you appreciate his quirky style, you might just end up loving everything he does. I know that's true for me. I'll always remember that I first watched the film on my 50th birthday with two friends I have known since I was 11. That was a great experience and I would like to watch Moonrise Kingdom again right now.Overall score 4.5/5 (with the potential to rise to 5/5 after repeat viewings).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW9OVPO3H3VKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007L6VR6M#wasThisHelpful","RW9OVPO3H3VKI","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The presence of Liam Neeson is main reason that I wanted to see The Grey. I've become an even bigger fan since I bought Taken and saw that he could even bring depth to a character in an action movie. Neeson seems authentic in just about any role, even if he's just providing the voice for an animated character.In The Grey, Neeson is clearly the main character. We see him contemplate suicide at the start of the movie, before deciding against it. The story involves a group of oil workers stationed in Alaska. Ottway (Neeson) is a marksman who keeps the workers safe from wolves when they are at work. He carries a rifle and is always watching for possible attacks. He has a low opinion of most of the workers and doesn't enjoy having to spend time with them.Ottway's world changes when he's involved in a plane crash. The oil workers encounter bad weather and turbulence, and the resulting crash leaves most of the group dead or dying. It's here that Ottway assumes a leadership role without being asked or voted in. Like the wolves he kills, his instincts cannot be denied. In the surviving group, it quickly becomes clear that he's the alpha. Ottway has a way of facing facts and helping others to accept the inevitable. This is perfectly illustrated when one of the crash victims dies in front of him. Ottway calms him and takes charge of the situation when the other men are incapable of deciding how to handle it.The movie partly reminded me of The Edge, starring Anthony Hopkins. Although this group of survivors is larger, and they are hunted by wolves instead of a bear, the terrain is similar. The Grey seems realistic and doesn't idealize the situation in any way. The men are in danger and fighting for their lives, and their actions are plausible. If you are facing a pack of wolves unarmed, your chances of survival are not good. The Grey doesn't shy away from that fact.Action scenes are infrequent, but have considerable impact. How would you try to survive if you had no food or shelter and had to make your way through freezing snow? Would it be best to try to make your own way back to civilization, or stay at the crash site and hope for rescue?The movie explores the characters of several of the crash survivors and we come to understand their individual choices. The setting is grim, so don't expect a heartwarming story. This is real.I didn't know what to expect from The Grey, but it left me somewhat surprised. The body count was definitely higher than expected, and I assumed that the group would generate more internal conflict than it did. That said, I did feel as though I was a part of the quest for survival and I was engaged at all times. Neeson carried the movie, but three or four supporting characters were important to the story.If you enjoy experiencing things that you are unlikely to witness in your real life, The Grey is a compelling story which transports you to an unfamiliar setting. If you are sensitive to watching characters get picked off one at a time, it might not be for you.The Blu-ray offers a pleasing presentation. The audio is just about perfect, and you'll feel involved in scenes such as the plane crash. The picture quality is also very good, but sometimes appears intentionally grainy to heighten the effect of being lost in a bleak, snowy wilderness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IU8OW1E8UE7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIIS0#wasThisHelpful","R1IU8OW1E8UE7W","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What would you do if you thought that you and your family were in danger of being killed by a deadly storm?Take Shelter shows us a glimpse inside the mind of Curtis (Michael Shannon), who has vivid dreams of an approaching storm. In his dreams, his wife and young daughter are in terrible danger. The film sometimes blurs the line between fantasy and reality and we see events unfold that are later revealed as dreams. His dog bites him in one such event and unidentified strangers attack him and his daughter in another episode.We all have nightmares, but Curtis experiences more than just dreams. He also hears the storm approaching. While he is working outside with his colleague, Dewart (Shea Whigham), Curtis hears a thunderbolt strike. Dewart doesn't hear a thing.Do you trust what you see and hear without question? What would you think if you could hear things that nobody else could?If what Curtis experiences is really happening, how is that possible? Is it some form of intervention from God? It is some kind of psychic ability? Is the subconscious mind revealing what Curtis knows on some level?To complicate matters, Curtis was left alone outside a store as a child when his mother had a mental breakdown and just walked away. He visits her in a nursing home because he fears that he might be going down the same path. It's such a realistic possibility that we are drawn into his world. Is he going crazy? He seems rational most of the time, but then he experiences another dream or hallucination.His wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain), is more than patient. We get the feeling that their relationship is strong and she clearly loves him. In a good relationship, it should be possible to talk openly about such problems, but Curtis initially hides everything from her. This is done out of fear. He's afraid of what might be happening to him and he's embarrassed about his experiences. He visits a doctor and a psychiatrist without her knowledge and even makes a serious financial decision without discussing it.Lack of communication is a huge problem in most relationships. If you are with the person you are supposed to trust more than anyone in the world, why can't you voice all of your fears? Curtis is eventually compelled to talk to Samantha because there's no other way to explain his bizarre behavior.Take Shelter shows us what occurs in the mind of a tormented man. The tension slowly builds and we can sense that something is going to happen. Is Curtis going crazy, or will all of his actions be justified? I won't reveal that here.The ending is somewhat controversial. I liked it a lot and think it was the perfect way to conclude the story. Shannon does a great job in the final scenes and there's one particular expression which speaks volumes. Unfortunately, I can't talk about it without ruining things.The film only cost around $1 million to make, but it achieves more than many big-budget productions. The story felt real to me and I could easily empathize with everything Curtis went through. The two hours went by fast and the tension was incredible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V8XU2RKOCIRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006PGL7OQ#wasThisHelpful","R1V8XU2RKOCIRH","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The main characters are children and we are given enough information to identify with them. Even if we weren't like any of them ourselves, we almost certainly went to school with similar children.The movie feels like a combination of Stand by Me and some of the best Steven Spielberg stories, such as E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The story feels like it could have been written by Stephen King and contains a slice of small-town America, combined with a fantasy element.The opening scene mentions an accident at a steel mill in which Elizabeth Lamb is killed. Her husband, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), is a deputy, and her son, Joe (Joel Courtney), is helping his friends make a movie. We spend a lot of time with these children and events are seen from their viewpoint. The group enlists Alice (Elle Fanning) to play a role in their movie and she impresses them with her superior acting ability. Joe starts to develop feelings for her and it's this relationship which drives the story.One of the most memorable scenes comes early in the movie. While the kids are filming, a train approaches. Charles (Riley Griffiths), who is the director, wants to shoot a scene while the train is passing. A truck drives onto the tracks in front of the train and causes a massive accident. The scene is spectacular and will rock your home theater. After surviving the accident, the kids notice a carriage on its side and something is pounding on the walls from within.That's the setup and I don't think there's any need to ruin things by giving away any more of the story. Courtney and Fanning give strong performances and their developing friendship is believable. Alice's father is a source of conflict and Joe's father has a role to play in the safety of the town. Part of the fun is watching events unfold and trying to solve the mystery. What is causing these things to happen? Why are people and animals disappearing?Super 8 evokes a special feeling. It's partly nostalgia as we remember friendships in our childhood, and the movie feels as if it belongs in the 70s or early 80s. Technology wasn't as advanced as it is now and there is a closeness between the people in the town that is rare to see in today's world. The friendship between the children makes everything work and it feels authentic.Although the early part of the movie relies on special effects, there is a real story here with a little depth. If you like Spielberg's classic movies, you'll probably enjoy what Abrams has done. If you were wondering whether Abrams includes lens flares like he did in Star Trek, they are present throughout the movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S8FA64XNI1NM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EPYZQ2#wasThisHelpful","R3S8FA64XNI1NM","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Spoilers within***It's difficult to hold the interest of an audience for almost three hours, especially in an age where people can't go five minutes without checking their text messages or tweeting about what's happening in a movie. Heat was made in 1995 when it was much easier to forget the outside world for three hours, and that's part of its strength.The most obvious thing to mention is that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro appear on screen together for the first time, and it's the first time they two have appeared in the same film since The Godfather: Part II. Both actors are close to their best and their two meetings are memorable.Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) works for the LAPD. His job is his passion and he places it above personal relationships. He's on his third marriage and that is failing because he only gives his wife a fraction of his attention if he's home at all. Neil McCauley (De Niro) also has a passion, but he's on the wrong side of the law. He heads a group of thieves who are professional and extremely effective. Unlike Hanna, McCauley doesn't want any personal ties preventing him from being the best he can be.McCauley has a favorite quote:""Have no attachments. Allow nothing to be in your life that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner.""The movie shows us how effective McCauley's crew is when they rob an armored truck early in the movie. One of the crew, Waingro (Kevin Gage), is a loose cannon. His behavior leads to three unnecessary deaths so McCauley decides to kill him. Unfortunately, a passing patrol car distracts McCauley and allows Waingro to escape. He's a constant source of trouble for the remainder of the story.McCauley's life changes when he meets Eady (Amy Brenneman). Instead of being a free agent, he's in danger of becoming tied down to a relationship. Will he abandon the idea that he can walk away from any situation in 30 seconds, or will she complicate things?What sets Heat apart is the strong characterization. Mann takes his time establishing all of the characters, even if they have minor roles. As a result, we feel as if we know these people. McCauley's strengths and efficiency are obvious and we learn the roles and abilities of the other crew members. Mann doesn't stop there. We see one crew member, Chris Shiherlis (Kilmer), interacting with his wife (Ashley Judd). Chris has a gambling problem and it's affecting his marriage. His wife questions whether they should even be together. This type of depth is present throughout the movie.Because we know the characters, it matters when something happens to them. Hanna's life is his job and he's essentially a hunter. McCauley is his current prey and we see Hanna using every available tool to find out what McCauley's crew is planning. As he learns more about McCauley, Hanna finds that he respects the man. They are similar in many ways and both are intelligent.The most notable scene in the movie happens after Hanna pulls over McCauley in his car. He's not there to arrest him, but simply asks if they can have coffee together. The scene shows the personalities of both men and it's brilliantly written. Hanna mentions that it's his job to stop McCauley and that it's nothing personal. McCauley replies with a warning that he would have to take Hanna out if he got in his way. These are not threats, but calmly-stated facts. The scene is based on a real exchange between McCauley and Chicago cop, Chuck Adamson. If you think the scene is unrealistic, it really happened.Heat is a drama more than anything else, but the brief action scenes are intense. The actors received training to make their shootouts appear authentic. Mann's focus on such details makes the whole story feel real. When we see people working at a crime scene, many are real forensic experts.I can't promise 170 minutes of thrills, but the final scenes are among the most intense I've seen portrayed within the genre. All of the acting is good, but Pacino and De Niro understandably dominate things. If you enjoy character-driven stories, Heat is well worth your time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROVPVZI6M518A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017HRJ04#wasThisHelpful","ROVPVZI6M518A","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first read Needful Things about 20 years ago, not long after it was published. One thing I like about Stephen King's stories is how familiar the worlds seem. Then he changes one or two small details and introduces a supernatural element. We still relate to the story because we identify so strongly with the setting he establishes. Like many of King's books, Needful Things is set in the fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine.The movie is not an entirely faithful adaptation of the book, but that's partly due to the length of the original story. A few details are changed to help the story along and other elements are completely omitted. The remaining story still works well as a movie, but it could have been even better.What would you do if The Devil lived in your town?Leland Gaunt (von Sydow) opens a store in Castle Rock. Needful Things sells all manner of antiques and collectibles and Gaunt initially appears to be a friendly old man. His first customer is a young boy, Brian Rusk, who has a large collection of Topps baseball cards. After Gaunt asks him to wish for any item he can imagine, Brian thinks of a 1956 Mickey Mantle Topps card. When Brian closes his eyes and touches the card, he can see Mantle playing in a game from decades ago. The card is worth hundreds of dollars, but Gaunt asks for just 95c. The other part of the price is a deed.The deeds are tricks played on other people. Brian is told to throw turkey droppings at freshly-washed sheets hanging on a neighbor's washing line. He barely knows the woman and so there's almost no chance she will find out that it was him. Gaunt uses this tactic with everyone who enters the store. He somehow has an item that each covets, whether it's sunglasses worn by Elvis Presley, a first edition of Treasure Island signed by the author, or a toy horse-racing game that accurately predicts winners of upcoming races. People are willing to perform tricks to acquire items they desperately want.Most people don't have a clue what is going on, but Sheriff Alan Pangborn (Harris) sees what Gaunt is doing. The tricks start to become more cruel and dangerous, and some ultimately become fatal. Gaunt apparently travels from one town to the next and feeds off the evil and negative energy.The biggest flaw in the movie adaptation is a speech designed to give the story a typical Hollywood climax. It seems out of place and unrealistic, but I understand why it was added. That aside, it's one of the best King adaptations. The acting is strong for the most part, with good performances from Amanda Plummer, Bonnie Bedelia and J. T. Walsh supporting the excellent work of Harris and von Sydow.It's fascinating watching how a few evil deeds can impact a friendly small town. The story is simple, but it seems so plausible.What would you do to possess your own needful thing?Overall score 3.5/5","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J17WFJ2I29G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000068IES#wasThisHelpful","R2J17WFJ2I29G5","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What would you do if you were diagnosed with cancer?Will Reiser's screenplay is based on his own experiences after he was diagnosed. That doesn't sound like a promising subject for a comedy, but 50/50 is definitely funny. It's also quite moving in places and the subject matter sometimes provides genuine drama.I know that some people will avoid seeing the movie because they either have cancer themselves or know someone with the disease. I understand that choice, but I lost my mother to cancer when I was 12 and I'm glad that I bought the movie. I have friends who deal with serious diseases by joking about it. You would never know that they were ill. Just because 50/50 is a comedy, it doesn't mean that it makes light of cancer.The main difference between 50/50 and a movie such as The Bucket List is that the main character is in his twenties. We all know that we will die one day, but it seems wrong to have a life-threatening illness at such a young age.Adam Lerner (Gordon-Levitt) works as a radio show writer. One day while running he experiences back pain. When he gets it checked out, it turns out that he has a large cancerous tumor in his spine. Rachael (Howard), his girlfriend, promises to give him all the support he needs. His best friend, Kyle (Rogen), insists that Adam will be fine. Adam's mother (Houston), who is already dealing with her husband's Alzheimer's, wants to move in with Adam help him through a difficult time.Adam can scarcely believe what has happened and spends most of his time with Kyle. They regularly get drunk and high and Kyle tries to use Adam's disease as a hook to attract women. He seems to worry more about getting laid than the health of his friend. Rachael does her best at first, but when the reality of Adam's situation takes hold, she isn't as supportive as she expected to be. When crunch time finally comes, it's Kyle who is there for Adam.We are shown some of the realities faced by people with cancer. Adam befriends other cancer patients at the hospital and they all have an optimistic outlook on life, despite the reality of their disease.Another major character is Katherine (Kendrick), who plays Adam's therapist. She's 24-years-old and younger than Adam and he's skeptical when she reveals that he is only the third patient she's ever had. I enjoyed Kendrick's performance in Up in the Air and was impressed again here. Her character is much warmer in this movie and Adam likes her as a person despite her flaws.The acting is good across the board. Gordon-Levitt is very good as Adam, without going over the top. Rogen's character is initially abrasive and somewhat annoying, but he proves to have hidden depths. The friendship felt authentic by the end of the movie. Anjelica Houston doesn't have a large role, but she makes use of every second.The title refers to Adam's chances of survival when he looks up his disease on the Internet. The chances that you will like the movie are significantly higher.The Blu-ray presentation is very good and comes with a commentary, deleted scenes, and a feature explaining the story behind the movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UQ7KUSWVVWRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QL7KKM#wasThisHelpful","R1UQ7KUSWVVWRP","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you remember the first Blu-ray you ever bought? Mine was Burn After Reading on the same day that I purchased my first Blu-ray player. It's a title that receives very little recognition and it regularly features in sales. Why is that the case?The movie is directed by the Coen brothers and stars Clooney, Pitt, McDormand, Malkovich and Swinton. What's not to like?I'm hard to please when it comes to humor, but several Coen brothers films hit the spot. It's clever dialogue rather than slapstick physical humor, and some of it is unpredictable. I can't laugh when I see a joke coming from a mile away wearing a T-shirt with ""This is funny, laugh now"" written on it. I like to be surprised.So what is surprising about Burn After Reading?Harry Pfarrer (Clooney) has no redeeming features. He's married, but sees other women at every opportunity. He's having an affair with Katie Cox (Swinton). Harry is shallow, paranoid and somewhat stupid and Clooney plays the character with his usual charm and good humor.If there is anyone dumber than Harry, it has to be Chad Feldheimer (Pitt), who works in a gym. Chad is a complete idiot in every way. His friend at the gym is Linda Litzke (McDormand), who is obsessed with undergoing cosmetic surgery to improve her appearance.Osborne Cox (Malkovich) is married to Katie and works as an analyst for the CIA. Most of his sentences include at least one profanity and he's borderline alcoholic. The story begins with a meeting in which Osborne is told that he will be demoted, but instead of accepting the situation, he quits. Katie is not pleased, even though she's on the verge of leaving him for Harry.There's not much of a plot. Chad acquires a CD containing the beginning of Osborne's memoir and believes it to be secrets of national importance. He thinks that Osborne is sure to give him a reward if he returns it and that leads to an amusing phone call. Linda decides that the Russians may be interested in the worthless CD and that they might reward her for the useless information.Everybody seems to be sleeping with everyone else and what could go wrong does go wrong. This is not a serious story in any way.There's a great cameo by J. K. Simmons who plays a CIA boss. He's utterly clueless about the significance of the events we witness because they are all meaningless. Watch his reaction at the end of the movie when he makes a decision about what further action to take.Burn After Reading is a good way to spend an hour-and-a-half. No analysis is necessary. All of the characters have funny moments. Ignore the negative reviews and see it for yourself. You can pick it up for under $10 if you like it.Overall score 4.5/5","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13YF2SCU9QU0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001JIE7JM#wasThisHelpful","R13YF2SCU9QU0W","A2RHQMV5GD18Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This could generously be described as a heartwarming family story, but I was disappointed in this novel. Two sisters who've chosen different paths, now  middle-aged and coming together to plan a surprise 50th dinner party for their parents. There's some mild tension between the two sisters, and some excitement from their overly dramatic mother... and what is supposed to be a life-changing secret revealed (49% in - talk about overly long buildup) but I was left pretty bored. I was expecting a major health issue to come into play after all the comments about the ladies' moods and energy levels, but that did not happen. Realistic? Yes. Something worth reading? No. I don't need to know about all the meals, or someone pausing while speaking to clear their throat, etc. There are many cutesy scenes and comments, but not enough to carry the story as a comedic look at family life (the couch of doom was ridiculous and stupid, not funny).  And my last complaint is that this is a Christian novel. Fabulous. Then how about showing how the characters' faith affects their lives (rather than just a few general comments about prayer). I am a Christian, but honestly I probably would have enjoyed the novel more if the ""faith light"" had been left out entirely...The kindle version also had issues with formatting. An abundance of hyphenated text (appar-ently these weren't edited out when converting from the ready to print version), and all too often there was no space between new sections within a chapter, so I'd be reading along when suddenly the last line read made no sense, and I'd have to go back.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DRIFOHMN9ZV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007V94X7E#wasThisHelpful","R1DRIFOHMN9ZV5","AAZRP13OJWEGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAZRP13OJWEGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OK for a quick read on a Saturday afternoon, but completely forgettable. It's a storyline that's been used over and over, and the characters aren't well enough developed here to make this little novel stand out. What on earth was it about Summer that made Clayton fall for her? She's endured a lot in her life, but there was nothing of her strength or resolve - instead she was a swoony, insecure girl (and the sheriff wasn't much better, although of course his first wife died tragically, and he was unable to think of loving again until gazing into Summer's eyes).

"I think this is a nice book to recommend to someone who hasn't dabbled much in paper crafting, or is drawn to art journaling but is intimidated by the mixed media, more ""artsy"" approach.  Nichole Rae has a clean, simple style that relies heavily on computer generated text.

"I stumbled onto this book via a recommendation on goodreads, and took a chance.  There were many things I really liked about the story itself: young mom in a stable marriage who's having a hard time adjusting to life after a cross-country move AND the transition from working in the ""outside"" world to being home with a child.  I found this general storyline very realistic, and there were times that I was nodding along as Essie tried to work through her frustrations.BUT... (three star rating, you knew it was coming!!)There were several elements that just didn't come together for me.  As much as the author builds up the interview scenario, I found the ""confrontation"" with her husband ridiculous.  Seriously, one argument and then all is well?  That tied up way too neatly.  The church full of super-trendy, rich people also came off as silly.  Why exactly was her brother there?  And where was his wife in all this?  Why was Essie dumped into what her brother knew was going to be a tough situation -- and why exactly couldn't one person be expected to handle a room of 8 year old boys for a single hour once a week?!  I have kids that age and have logged many hours teaching... the classroom drama was definitely overly done, and don't even get me started on the parents.  There is a very clearly spelled out ""moral"" at the end, as Essie realizes that she was guilty of misjudging people... All well and good but the clownish portrayals of those other women made it kind of hard to swallow.And lastly, there were several points that just didn't ring true for a ""current"" young woman: her excitement over a velour bodysuit with a teddy bear applique, for example.  That's what a Grandma gets excited about, NOT the Mom.  And there is another scene where it's mentioned that Essie has shot two rolls of film trying to get the perfect picture of her son... this was published in 2006?My favorite scene is when Essie and her one ""real"" friend are chatting.  Essie is complaining that everyone else makes mothering look so easy, and Cece (who has older children) replies:""Stop spending so much time comparing yourself of you'll go crazy.  Remember... you're only seeing what those women want you to see.  What they've worked hard to make sure you see... But don't be fooled, we're all just hanging on by our fingernails.""Overall, it was a cute read with some warm moments, but also veered into unrealistic cheesiness at times.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10L736S46KETH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373090862#wasThisHelpful","R10L736S46KETH","AAZRP13OJWEGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAZRP13OJWEGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Julia's son is now five years old, and she has settled into a rhythm: helping care for her younger brother, helping her grandmother out, working, and going back to school.  Her long-time boyfriend is smart and handsome, so clearly things are pretty good, right?But then her son's father tracks her down, and Julia is once again thrown off balance.  The author does a wonderful job of portraying the struggles - the desire to do what's best for her son but also wanting good for herself.  These are the day to day things that wear us down and expose raw emotions.  Grandma Nellie is once again a quiet pillar of strength, but Julia is noticing that even her pillar is getting tired.  This trilogy is seriously in my top five of Christian fiction - real, thought provoking, showing quiet faith as well as doubts, and beautifully written to boot.A few of my favorite lines:""I was grateful that no one seemed to notice my personal combat...

"I have stacks of ""Get organized now!"" type books (at least I *think* they're somewhere on my jumbled bookshelf...) but I struggle to get started,  In the first chapter, she says, ""This book will be different than any other book on organization that you've probably read. I have no schedule to offer you... Your standard for an organized home and reasonable schedule will vary... What I hope to do is to help you examine your heart and discover things that may be hindering your walk with God.""  She then delves into four different idols that may come into play: perfectionism, busyness, possessions, and leisure. I did like her encouragement to ""Make your schedule a matter of prayer"" - we often discuss being good stewards with our finances, but time is all too often overlooked.She makes some excellent points, and even offers some good questions for personal reflection, but I wish that there had been more actual advice. So if I'm struggling with possessions, what can I actually *DO* while I'm praying about it.  From the final chapter: ""Commit to change, and prayerfully seek the Lord's strength as you do so, but be prepared for discouraging days.  Conquering sin takes time and effort, but the peace that you have afterwards is always worth it.""Worthwhile read if you struggle to keep your home and schedule running smoothly, but consider this a first step in the journey, and plan to seek out a more detailed guide that's specific to your situation/issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34MJ2EZAB0MS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PLO5RO#wasThisHelpful","R34MJ2EZAB0MS3","AAZRP13OJWEGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAZRP13OJWEGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was able to borrow this from my library, and honestly am thankful I did not spend my money on this DVD.Margaret Peot has some good ideas, but her presentation is very dry and stilted.  I would like to think that she finds making art enjoyable, but frankly it did not come off that way based upon her manner; she seemed cold and lacking passion for the project.  When she is lecturing (and yes, that is the right word) there are many pauses, ""ums,"" and sometimes the steps are not presented in logical order.  It seemed that there was a rough list of what would be presented in each segment, but would have benefited from a detailed outline and a more involved producer.During the segment on applying gouache, she actually pulls one of her tools out and announces, ""This is a brush."" OK, then, so this is geared toward a beginner?  Then how about mentioning whether she'd recommend natural or synthetic bristles, flat or round tip?  Yet at other times she mentions specialty tools very matter of factly, seeming to assume that the viewer has a basic knowledge of mixed media art tools.The production quality itself is quite poor.  The sound is inconsistent, and voice levels vary a great deal from segment to segment; there is also a lot of background noise from the paper, water, etc.  The camera work was also frustrating - she would be describing something to watch for in the technique, but it was still a wide shot and we could not see what she was specifically talking about; there are random overhead shots, and sometimes she is gesturing to something that is off-screen.I was frustrated after viewing; frankly I think it would have been a fabulous article in a magazine with basic info on the various techniques, but it just doesn't work as a DVD.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T4A6U1WCJ7OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1440325111#wasThisHelpful","R2T4A6U1WCJ7OB","AAZRP13OJWEGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAZRP13OJWEGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me start off by saying that this is a very attractive timepiece. It's rose gold plated over a stainless steel body. You can see the movement in the front, and the back is open as well. It's amazing how many parts and pieces go into this, and it's really interesting to watch it work.This is a very large and substantial watch. It's thick and heavy to hold all the inner workings. And there's something to be said for a really pretty watch to dress up in.It comes nicely presented in a gift box. And the stainless steel deployant clasp mechanism is a nice touch.Having said all that, the instructions that came with this watch appear to be for a different style watch, so I'm having trouble setting the date and 24-hour mechanism. I was able to set the day of the week mechanism through trial and error. I went to check the website for additional instructions, and it appears to be down.There are three buttons on this watch, but I'm unable to adjust one of them. This could be user error, but there's no way for me to know since I can't find accurate instructions.I'm not sure this watch ever sold for anywhere near $755 on account of the band not being a very nice leather. Also, the fact that it comes with an instructional, cheap-looking leaflet rather than a booklet.However, if you're looking for a nice, interesting watch, consider it. I think of it, though, as costume jewelry. I really wanted this watch to be a little higher quality than it was.

"I have to be honest. I did not expect this product to do much for me. I do use anti-aging creams on my eyes and have been pleased with the results of some, but I've never used anything quite like this.I looked at the instructions and didn't like the idea that I'd look like a football player for about eight hours. Frankly, the mask looked gimmicky, but I gave it a try.I showered and applied the masks, not really liking the look at all. My face is small, and the masks covered a wider area of my face than in the illustration. Still, I left it on for about seven hours or so.During the time it was on, the mask was slightly uncomfortable but not horrible by any means. When I removed the masks, not expecting to see much change, I was astonished at how much better my eyes looked.This stuff works.

It's a little heavier than my previous dryer, but it feels solid and has really good power.The buttons make it versatile, and you can adjust the dryer to exactly what you need in terms of heat and speed. It also comes in dual voltage, so you can use it outside the US.This one's a winner. Again, very seriously reduced the frizz in my naturally curly hair. I am very, very pleased with this quality hair dryer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14JX593C733Y7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZY8XZ1E#wasThisHelpful","R14JX593C733Y7","A31RULW0KNYJ5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31RULW0KNYJ5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great commercial quality machine; it's exactly what you use at your local fitness club. It's the gold standard by which all other ellipticals are judged.The mechanical aspects of it are beyond reproach from every point of view. This is a work horse, designed to take any degree of punishment, engineered with great precision. Everything works flawlessly.I generally do a manual program work out, setting the resistance and varying the cross ramp to engage different sets of muscles.So what's not to like and why only four stars?Simply stated, this thing is not too bright. For a machine at this price point a much more sophisticated control is in order. Maybe this one can do some of the things I'd like it to, but if so it's certainly not evident, even after poring over the manual in detail. So it's either deficient or exceedingly user unfriendly.As noted, I enter a repetitive manual program for each workout. There should be a simple learn mode that allows the last workout entered to be retained. Similarly, it should be possible to enter parameters for a default user; I renter my weight and age each time. And what would really be nice would be if it would be possible to retain and export workouts to a PC based fitness program. Even inexpensive scales increasingly have bluetooth or wireless capability. Why not this over $ 6 grand behemoth?If the brains of this brute contained more intelligence it would be close to perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2699VRJ5YCE9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053O3Y4W#wasThisHelpful","R2699VRJ5YCE9L","A204G7E13UW2B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204G7E13UW2B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For people who are reasonably fit it's a stretch to justify the purchase of this neat looking gizmo.My problem is not so much the price (it's a well built piece of equipment) or the challenge of assembling it (not as tough as some suggest). It's just that for me most of the stretches are either ineffective, or not as good as comparable ones accomplished on the floor.Here's my rundown:Stretch 1 - Lower Back: This is a good one that I do daily. It really works an area that needs to be flexible to prevent all manner of other problems. No argument with this one.Stretch 2 - Hamstrings: It's OK but not as good as alternatives on the floor.Stretch 3 - Gluteals and hips: This is a good one; no problems here.Stretch 4 - Hips legs and back: Like number 2 no real advantage over the floor version.Stretch 5 - Inner thighs and groin: Excellent!Stretch 6 - Upper Back: This one does nothing for me. I skip it.Stretch 7 - Shoulders: Like 6, virtually useless.Stretch 8 - Quads: Not too different from the stretch you would do without the machine. No apparent value added...So all in all it's a mixed bag, worthy of 3 stars only.

"Adam Rubin and Daniel Salmieri, creators of Dragons Love Tacos, Those Darn Squirrels and various other kids lit high jinx have come up with another one to get the whole family chortling at story time.This time the protagonist is Raccoon, a perennially hungry (for pizza, that is) and clearly very clever varmint. As we learn on the opening page, ""All he wants in life is a pizza"".There is a  myriad of reasons for this, particularly following from ""...the gooey cheesy-ness, salty pepperoni-ness, sweet, sweet tomato-ness, and crispy, crunchity crust"" of Raccoon's favorite dish.Problem is, every time our furry hero tries to help himself, he's chased off by broom wielding adversaries.The action culminates with Raccoon crashing a secret pizza party, using his natural coloration to blend in with the other masquerading guests.

"This great book presents a prismatic and at times kaleidoscopic view of a very grand swath of almost everything. Well, not quite everything, but an amazing cross section of interesting and obscure material is fair game for author Caspar Henderson.In the introduction, he explains what he was up to as follows: ""I have tried to look at a few ways of being from different angles and, through 'a wealth of unexpected juxtapositions,' explore how they are like and unlike humans (or how we imagine ourselves to be) and also how their differences from and similarities to us cast light on human capabilities and human concerns"".That pretty much sums it up.The book is organized as a abecedarium, with 26 (actually 27) chapters, (there are two for X) each one nominally dealing with a creature whose name begins with that letter. I say nominally, because the subject of the chapter is nothing more than a gateway into a labyrinth of free association that at times will almost take your breath away.To provide a flavor of this, here's one sentence from each of the chapters (one X only this time)...1. Axolotl - Three or four thousand years ago in Mesopotamia people imagined that a being called Oannes, half-man and half-fish, rose from the sea to teach wisdom to mankind.2. Barrel Sponge - Even if we accept the idea of deep time as a reality, it is still hard to understand because its dimensions are so far outside our normal cognitive range.3. Crown of Thorns Starfish - The drug addict, drunk, wife-shooter and writer William Burroughs used to tell a story about a man who teaches his anus to talk.4. Dolphin - Spinner dolphins of both sexes sometimes engage in orgies of more than a dozen individuals, known as `wuzzles'.5. Eel - Moray eels have a second set of jaws deep at the back of their throat which shoot forward at high speed, grab the prey and rapidly protract backwards again, pulling the prey down into the oesophagus as the animal closes its mouth.6. Flatworm - Death has always been a looming presence, a lurking silent interlocutor behind a bewildering variety of masks, with whom we have an intermittent but unending dialogue in our heads.7. Gonodactylus - ""The sun"", wrote Galileo, ""with all those planets revolving around it and depending upon it, can still ripen a bunch of grapes as if it had nothing else in the universe to do"".8. Human - As the tale goes, Orpheus makes such beautiful music that the birds and beasts are enchanted, the trees and rocks dance, and even rivers change course in order to get closer to him.9. Iridogorgia Pourtalesii - The DNA in a few thousand people, joined in a single chain, would reach the nearest star.10. Japanese Macaque - Japanese macaques have long red faces and eyes that are close set like those of George W. Bush.11. Kiripha-Ko and Thikili-Ko - It would be nice to have animal company that is not under our thumb and has more charisma than the cockroach, the super-rat, and other ""super species"" which, some predict, will dominate a degraded future environment.12. Leatherback Turtle - In the karesansui, or Zen gardens, of Japan, rocks and vegetation are arranged in gravel or sand which is in turn scored with lines and patterns.13. Mystaceus - Each species of jumping spider taps out its own distinctive dances of intimidation and seduction - three or even seven-act shows that combine features of a semaphore, flamenco, and South African gumboot dancing.14. Nautilus - Alfred Tennyson anticipated Wells: The hills are shadows and they flow / From form to form and nothing stands; / They melt, like mist, the solid lands, / Like clouds they shape themselves and go.15. Octopus - Perhaps the most significant role for a cephalopod in Greek and Roman myth is as an inspiration for the Scylla, a monster that seizes sailors between three sharp rows of teeth mounted in each of six heads at the end of six long necks.16. Pufferfish - Prickliness, toxicity and ferocity have served the Pufferfish well in the exuberant but ruthless ecosystem of the coral reef.17. Quetzalcoatlus - At the time of writing, films of wingsuit `flight' available online include Grinding the Crack by Jeb Corliss and Sense of Flying by Espen Fadnes.18. Right Whale - The males compete not by fighting but by trying to out produce each other in the sheer quantity of sperm that they pass to females in frequent and promiscuous couplings from their prodigious testicles (each one of a mature male's pair can weigh half a tonne, or about 550 lb - the largest of any animal).19. Sea Butterfly - Sea butterflies are pteropods: sea snails that swim by flapping pad-like `feet' which have grown into wings.20. Thorny Devil - Moloch was a Canaanite god who in John Milton's account was smeared with the blood of human sacrifice.21. Unicorn: Goblin Shark - Like the Wuggly Ump, its other habits are obscure.22. Venus's Girdle - If squeezed they yield but then return to their original shape like gumbles, the fictional creatures in the neglected Australian children's classic, Bottersnikes and Gumbles.23. Waterbear - In a half joke, the cosmologist Stephen Hawking calls humans a `chemical scum', so tiny and insignificant are we in the vastness of space.24. Xenoglaux - One of the most striking European works of art may be Francisco Goya's etching in his Caprichos series, `The Dream of Reason Produces Monsters', in which a sleeping human figure (perhaps the artist himself)is mobbed by owls and bats with terrible eyes.25. Yeti Crab - `Panspermia' is not, as it may sound, the name of a distant planet in the 1974 soft porn shlockfest Flesh Gordon, but a perfectly serious scientific idea.26. Zebrafish - Voltaire admired the English but he barbed his praise: ""Do not, while in their company,"" he wrote ""express surprise that they have such pretty children"".See what I mean?Unexpected juxtapositions, indeed.My highest recommendation...","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11BXF2KN3LXZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022604470X#wasThisHelpful","R11BXF2KN3LXZI","A204G7E13UW2B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204G7E13UW2B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So sings Dylan in a beautiful solo piano version of When I Paint My Masterpiece that closes out this collection.And so it is. The haunting, unadorned and authentic work that appears on Another Self Portrait certainly seems like a masterpiece as over and against what was actually released in 1970.Dylan's unfortunate later penchant for not releasing some of his best work (think Blind Willie McTell and Foot of Pride from Infidels) seems to have gotten underway at this time. In this sense, Greil Marcus inadvertently had it right in asking, ""What is this ____t?"" in the famous 1970 Rolling Stone review of the original Self Portrait. The release at that time of the honest, unadorned traditional songs that we now hear for the first time would have been a tour de force. Better late than never...Anyway, setting revisionism aside, let's look at this current and excellent release.Of the 35 tracks, the majority are from the Self Portrait sessions. These include versions of songs that were released, heard here without the often ill advised overdubbing, as well as a number of other songs in a similar spare style that should have been released, but were not. Apart from the Self Portrait material, there's some great stuff from the New Morning sessions later in 1970. In addition, there are several alternate versions of Nashville Skyline content, a couple of great live recordings from the Isle of Wight, and a smattering of other work from the 1967 - 1971 period.Here are a few of my favorite cuts:Went to See the Gypsy - The demo version with just Dylan and David Bromberg on guitar is faraway, haunting, and wistful. It sounds true to the lyric in a way that the urgent delivery of the released version misses almost entirely.Pretty Saro - While Bob is known for many things, I've always felt he was at his best singing love songs. This one is astonishing; a mellifluous and lyric expression of lovesick longing. Anyone who says that Dylan can't sing should listen to this. His voice here manages to express something that is almost inexpressible.These Hands - Johnny Cash covered this great Eddie Noack number; why didn't Bob's beautiful version make it onto Self Portrait?Working on a Guru - A hard driving 12 bar blues with - in a sublime irony - George Harrison delivering guitar riffs sounding more like Mike Bloomfield than the Maharishi following former Beatle. Dylan calls out, ""Play it one time"", and then, obviously having a whale of a good time, ""Play it again"". Harrison laughs a lays down an additional series of hot licks.Copper Kettle - Stripped of the syrupy orchestral and choral overdubs this song is a revelation. There's a raw power here, almost completely absent in the original. As Dylan sings ""Don't use no green or rotten wood. It'll get you by the smoke"" he emits a guttural growl that'll make your hair stand on end.I know I'm going to be listening to Another Self Portrait a lot. It's that good...","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38MXSDCJ8P4L3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DW5IM9Q#wasThisHelpful","R38MXSDCJ8P4L3","A204G7E13UW2B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204G7E13UW2B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Riedel is a fine company with a long tradition that generally makes excellent glassware.Even though I've rated these with 3 stars only, there's nothing really wrong with them. They're well proportioned for savoring big wines, and are durable enough for careful dishwashing. Quality of the lead free glass is also excellent.So what's not to like?I personally don't care for certain design details that follow from the modern production methods that have been used.The traditional method of making a wine glass results in an organic look, in which the bowl, stem, and base flow together as a single entity. In this process, the three elements come together while all are still hot out of the furnace, and are shaped through the skills of an experienced glass blower.In contrast, these Riedel glasses are produced in an automated assembly process. Each glass has five components; one blown (the bowl), one extruded (the stem), and three molded (the base and joiners). Riedel's choice of a fluted (ribbed) stem and little ziggurat shaped joiners draws attention to this composite nature, and makes for an overly fussy appearance.These are my opinions - some may disagree. But, as the Romans would have put it, ""De gustibus non est disputandum"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BFESG3ZA7HV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YT8GA6#wasThisHelpful","R1BFESG3ZA7HV9","A204G7E13UW2B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204G7E13UW2B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

On a few occasions, while casting to a bunch of busting albies, I've almost landed in the drink.

It's expensive, but worth it for sure.Other auto inflate PFD's use a salt sensing trigger system. These cost less, but in tough marine conditions, are prone to false alarms.

"This book is an absolute masterpiece.Award winning author and illustrator Simms Tabak retells thirteen tales from Eastern Europe, originally told him by his grandfather. The venerable Zayda is pictured on the frontispiece where we learn, ""He brought these stories to America from his little village in Poland"".The book begins with a series of Yiddish aphorisms, to whet your appetite and get you into the mood. Examples:* A wise man knows what he says and a fool says what he knows.* A shlimazel believes only in mazel.* From the lowly potato you get the choicest latke.The book ends with a glossary to help make sense of the aphorisms and to understand all that lies between. Some important Yiddish terms that are explained:* Chutzpah - nerve;* Meshugge - crazy;* Zhlub - oaf.The stories themselves are masterfully told, and illustrated with a vivid richness that only Simms can conjure up. Several made me roar with laughter. It's hard to describe how evocative of Yiddish idiosyncrasies all this is; suffice it to say that the agony and the ecstasy of life in the shtetl comes through loud and clear.Even when your kids get tired of it, this is a book you'll want to keep for yourself for reading over and over again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QFU15R8MSLYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670059552#wasThisHelpful","R2QFU15R8MSLYS","A204G7E13UW2B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204G7E13UW2B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm glad I didn't have to read this book to my kids. It falls into the category that would get old very quickly.Hildy is a sow. Moose is, you guessed it, a moose. They are the best of friends. Winston (not Winton, more on this later) is Hildy's cousin. He is a boar. As it turns out, as he notes in one of his attempts at humor, he his also a bore, a socially inept know it all from the city. The storyline involves the city slicker's visit to his cousin in the country. It doesn't take long for him to alienate Moose as well as all the other good old folks with his pompous and overbearing demeanor. In the end, however, Moose helps Winston to come down to earth, reconciliation follows, and all is well.The trouble is, none of this is very interesting or engaging. Black and white illustrations which would be fine in a vintage book don't add much zest to a bland and plodding text. Here's an example of the action:""'Knock, knock,' Moose shouted. 'Anybody home?'The vacuum cleaner stopped. 'I'm in here' Hildy called.Moose walked through the front hall to the living room.'Careful,' said Hildy. 'I just waxed the floor.'""Who cares! Vacuum cleaners and waxing the floor - are kids going to relate to this stuff? I think not...The whole thing seems like a lukewarm effort at best. This extends to the editing as well. Hence on page 50 we read, ""Moose parked the car. Winton took his suitcase out of the trunk"".Winston is one of the three main characters of this book. I would estimate the book has about 2000 words. You'd think if it was subject to any kind of pre publication review at all a typo like this one would have been caught.Is it a big deal? No.Is is a good book? Also, no.

"This is a clever device. It weighs you, feeds back your % body fat, takes your pulse, and displays the level of CO2 in the vicinity as a proxy for air quality. Then it sends all of this information to an app on your phone or tablet, where you can track your progress (and that of family members or others) and display the data in a variety of formats.After a couple of days, though, I sent it back.The biggest problem for me was slight inconsistency in back to back readings; a scale that sells for $ 150 should be totally accurate each and every time.If you're doing an elimination type eating plan, deviations of plus or minus tenths are important, and if you can't be certain from one weigh in to the next, it defeats the purpose.Beyond this, I really didn't know what to do about with the CO2 data.

"In The Little Prince, the six year old Antoine de Saint-Exupery draws a picture of an elephant inside a boa constrictor. He shows it to the grown-ups, expecting them to be terrified, to find that they can only see what looks to them like a hat.Something similar is afoot in Snow, by Caldecott Award winning author Uri Shulevitz. A little boy (identified only as ""boy with dog"") sees endless potential as the first flake of snow is sighted over an otherwise grey city. Filled with hope, he runs through the streets of the town crying out,""It's snowing"".Here are some of the responses of the adults he encounters on his way:""'It's only a snowflake,' said grandfather with beard"".""'It's nothing,' said man with hat"".""'It'll melt,' said woman with umbrella"".They are backed up by the media:""'No snow,' said radio"".""'No snow,' said television"".But as is importantly noted, ""...snowflakes don't listen to radio, snowflakes don't watch television"". And soon the whole city is blanketed in a thick cover of snow as boy with dog frolics about...Shulevitz' great genius, as always, is in his illustrations.

"""Notwithstanding his inveterate obstinacy, the ass is an excellent and sober little beast, far too much despised by us"". This observation of Francis Galton of the Royal Geographic Society is quoted early in The Lost City of Z, as part of the description of Percy Fawcett's perpetration and training for Amazonian exploration. The characterization of ""inveterate obstinacy"" might better have been applied to Fawcett himself...The Lost City of Z is the story of Fawcett's obsessive quest to validate his theory of the existence of a fabled civilization deep in the deadly uncharted South American rain forest. His unexplained disappearance and the fate of his final expedition created a parallel mystery that is investigated by noted journalist and author David Grann. While the ingredients of the tale should make for an absolute spellbinder, I found it to be interesting, but not more.For me it was the psychological observations relative to the protagonist that were more engaging than the adventure itself. These kept me going when the action itself dragged from time to time. Also interesting was the metamorphosis in the writing of the book of Gramm himself, from city slicker to jungle adventurer. This adds another level of psychological complexity as he himself becomes obsessed with Z. He writes, ""I pulled the map form my back pocket. It was wet and crumpled, the lines I had traced to highlight my route now faded. I stared at my markings, hoping that they might lead me out of the Amazon, rather than deeper into it. The letter Z was still visible in the center of the map. Yet it seemed less like a signpost than a taunt, another testament to my folly"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSFDZ2KYRW42Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400078458#wasThisHelpful","RSFDZ2KYRW42Y","A204G7E13UW2B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204G7E13UW2B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hmmm...What's the difference, anyway?Birders are more intense, serious, and scientific than bird watchers. A bird watcher just might be gazing at that red breasted nuthatch at the backyard feeder rather than crawling through a thicket in search of an elusive prothonotary warbler as the birder surely will.For watching, bigger, more life like illustrations and extensive descriptions are in order. Bird watchers will even enjoy various coffee table books about their feathered friends.Birders, however are all business.Grab the binoculars, put on a pith helmet, tuck that Peterson Field Guide under your arm, and off you go.If you want to distinguish between a bobolink and an eastern meadowlark with complete confidence every time, the Peterson System can't be beat. It's based on patternistic drawings with arrows to pinpoint the important distinguishing field marks of each species. In a sense what this provides is a pictorial key of readily noticed visual impressions so that the correct ID can be forthcoming in a flash. Since the publication of the original Field Guide in 1934 this approach has not been improved upon.The text is efficient and economical so as to convey a maximum of information in a minimum of space.

"In his introduction to this very good book Pope Francis writes, "" Dialogue is born from a respectful attitude toward the other person, from a conviction that the other person has something good to say. It supposes that we can make room in our heart for their point of view, their opinion, and their proposals. Dialogue entails a warm reception and not a preemptive condemnation.To dialogue one must know how to lower the defenses, to open the doors of one's home, and to offer warmth"".This book is the record of a dialogue between the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires and Abraham Skorka, a leading Argentine rabbi. Their conversations touch on a wide range of topics - God, prayer, death, science, the elderly, poverty, the Holocaust, globalization, and more. These are two very learned men, and the depth of their thinking on so many areas of life is remarkable.But what impressed me most was the love and respect for one another that shines through as they talk together and reason with one another.I came away with a soaring sense of human possibilities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BR1XS5Y9KPJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770435068#wasThisHelpful","R1BR1XS5Y9KPJN","A204G7E13UW2B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204G7E13UW2B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Good polarized sunglasses are among the most important gear for the fly fisher person. You want to be able to see beneath the surface to spot that nook or cranny that could conceal a trout. And if you succeed in enticing one out of its lair, seeing the fish chase the fly increases the fun factor, as well as your chance of hooking up.Anyway, I was recently out with legendary Adirondack guide Rich Garfield and had missed several takes in a row. We couldn't figure it out until Rich asked to see my shades, which I had paid a lot of money for. He handed me his Native Hardtops with copper (rose) colored lenses.

"This is a scholarly rather than a popular work and therefore it's somewhat dry and plodding for the average reader.Modern archeology has nothing in common with the swashbuckling imagery of mysterious and exciting artifacts in faraway places a la Indiana Jones. It's more about meticulous documentation of tiny contextual details of a site, analysis of soil anomalies and the like.As this is a thoroughly modern book about excavations in the vicinity of Stonehenge, the reader is treated to all manner of archeological minutiae. For instance we learn how the activity of earthworms impacts the location of rocks in a site, ""When we look at a soil profile that has not been disturbed by plowing for many centuries, we can see the effects of worm-sorting because the stones and pebbles lie at the bottom, beneath a layer of fine earth"".Nevertheless, there are some colorful snippets. As an example, here's how the author introduces his colleague John Evans: ""I'd know John Evans in his later years, when he was a professor of environmental archeology. He became the leading specialist in land mollusks - ""snail Evans"" to distinguish him from lots of other archeological Evanses - and was one of those people who's interested in everything. He'd had some difficult years when alcohol almost got the better of him, yet his mind was razor sharp and you never knew what he was going to say next"".OK, maybe a touch of Indiana here.But in the balance, I found the 350 pages of this book tough going. For the average reader there's just too much arcane musing about the characteristics of various post holes and similar matters.If you're a scientist - enjoy.

"Buyer beware!If you misplace that valuable proof of purchase, this lamp just might be worthless.Here's what happened to me...When assembling this made in China product, you have to attach the lamp stem to the base by way of a bolt that screws into a threaded casting in the stem. The base is heavy (though from reading other reviews not quite heavy enough to prevent the lamp from tipping over). But it weighs enough to make it difficult to keep absolutely square and level while screwing in the bolt. The bolt is steel. The part that receives it is a cheap zinc casting - much softer than the bolt. As a result, if the heavy base is even at a slight angle during assembly, you can cross thread the casting. That's what I inadvertently did...Let me say that I'm not a home improvement klutz. In fact, I have a lot of knowledge about lamps and their construction, having owned and operated a leading US based manufacturer of lighting fixtures for over 30 years. Even so, the cross threading mishap occurred.Anyway, while inconvenient, I figured it would be no big problem. I unscrewed the damaged casting from the stem and contacted OttLite customer service for a replacement. I was not asking to return the lamp, simply to replace a damaged part that I would estimate is worth not more than 25 cents. I offered to pay for the part and for shipping and handling as well.What followed was a Kafkaesque exchange of not less than 18 e-mails with the bureaucrats in the OttLite customer service (disservice?) department. The last one summed it up aptly: ""I apologize, but there is nothing we can do without the requested information"". The referenced requested information is that damn proof of purchase.Again, keep in mind that I wasn't asking for a replacement or anything at no charge. I just wanted to buy a small part so as to be able to use the lamp.No dice.So here's the end of the matter. Tomorrow is garbage day, and my brand new OttLite is going into the trash.

"Yvon Chouinard (founder of Patagonia) is a genius.The threat of infestations of invasive species such as didymo (colloquially known as rock snot) has put the kibosh to the use of felt soled wading boots in many locations around the country. Vermont, where I sometimes fish, is latest on the list.The problem is that until now, every alternative to felt, (studs, ""sticky"" soles, etc.) has resulted in dangerous falls on slippery rocks in the river. I've tried a bunch of them, and nothing worked. Inevitably, no matter how careful I was, I'd find myself on my keister, waders filling with water while being swept downstream.In recent years, Patagonia, like every other supplier of wading boots, has sold its share of such ineffective footwear.

Not willing to make the trade off between environmental responsibility and personal safety he experimented with approaches derived from the design of rock climbing crampons. These Rock Grip fixed aluminum bar boots are the result.Trust me - they work. They bite into virtually any rock surface except those coated with thick slimy algae on which even felt is not too effective. I've clambered over wet rocks, dry ones, in all kinds of currents and have yet to do an unintended swan dive into the river. These boots are also comfortable and definitely bomb proof in their construction.The only downside is that they're noisy.

"This is the story of Gino Bartali, winner of the Tour de France in 1938 as well as 1948. No other rider in history has won the Tour twice ten years apart.But it is much more than that. It is the story of Italy before, during and after the Second World War as it swung from fascism towards communism and ultimately settled on the multi party democratic republic that still is in place today. In it we learn about how Bartali's athletic feats inspired the nation in some of its darkest hours.And there is yet another story, this one about courageous Italians, some of who were later honored as Righteous Among the Nations for their selfless protection of Jews during the War. Excellent research by the authors illuminates the important role that Bartali played in this dangerous effort. He himself was quiet about his involvement with the resistance; during the War as a result of obvious concern for the safety of both him and others, but after it as a result of his unique and modest character.Unfortunately, the writing style of the book doesn't do justice to its content. The following description of Bartali's wedding illustrates the problem: ""Adriana wore a modest long sleeved white dress and floor length veil, which covered soft chestnut waves of hair, draped over her shoulders. Gino donned a dark suit and tie, and the triangle of a smart white handkerchief peeked out of his breast pocket"".In spite of this somewhat sophomoric style, the book is well worth reading.

"Crazy Horse, that is.Here he is talking about drummer Ralph Molina in his autobiography, Waging Heavy Peace, ""...Ralphie is extremely subtle and can express emotions beautifully in both a ballad and a laid-back song. He is completely unique, emotional, and driving at the same time. His flourishes with my feedback at the end of a song are always right with me, as if he knows right where I am going. Fact is, we are going there together, feeling our way, and that really applies to all of Crazy Horse. That is what makes the Horse as great as it is, and as cosmic as it is. That is the Force of the Horse. Making the new albums, Americana and Psychedelic Pill, I have found that this cosmic force has increased, not diminished, with time"".This love and respect comes through loud and clear throughout Psychedelic Pill. It's clear that these guys just can't get enough of playing together. As the packaging label notes, the result is ""...over 85 minutes of music"". One full hour of this is comprised of just three songs: Ramada Inn, Walk Like a Giant, and Driftin' Back, a lilting 27 minute improvisation. Can there be too much of a good thing?At first I thought maybe so, but as I listened again I thought really no.We also learn in Waging Heavy Peace that Neil is into long road trips in big 50's Lincolns and Cadillacs, and that's kind of what these songs are like. The beat just keeps beating, and it takes you away, far away. Maybe that's what he means by the cosmic force of Crazy Horse.My favorite songs are Twisted Road, For the Love of Man, and Walk Like A Giant. Twisted Road is a tribute to DylanLike Hank Williams chewing bubble gum,Asking me, ""How does it feel?"". In The Love of Man, Neil sings poignantly for his son Ben;For the love of manWho could understand what goes onWhat is right and what is wrongWhy the angels cry, and the heavens sighWhen a child is born to liveBut not like you or I.And Walk Like a Giant, a defiant affirmation of life even in the face of crumbling and disintegration;I used to walk like a giant on the landNow I feel like a leaf floating in a streamI want to walk like a giantI want to walk like a giant on the land.It ends with four minutes of single drum beats synched with jagged, distorted guitar chords.

Again, it's very difficult to imagine that anybody who buys a basic book like this will be inclined to get under the hood to swap out essential hardware components.My sense is that this book may be worthwhile for those who mourn the passing of product specific paper instruction manuals.

"Read the packaging for these sardines and you can't help but feel you're saving Mother Earth as you chomp on your sandwich. But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about. Unless of course BPA free packaging is your primary purchase criterion. If so, buy em now and don't read any further.If not there are some issues to be aware of...I understand that Wild Planet is the brand. But what about the ""wild"" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that there's no other kind, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.Then there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're ""sustainably caught along the California coast"". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are ""processed in Viet Nam"". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, ""These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations"".There are other issues as well.The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, ""Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk..."". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.We also learn that these ""delicious meaty portions"" are ""cleaned and scaled"". Buyer beware: this is quite different from ""skinless and boneless"". ""Cleaned"" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.How do they taste?Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring. The lemon juice in which they're packed adds a bit of zip, but these babies are smoked and have a characteristic smoky, salty taste.But don't worry.

"This book is Neil Young schmoozing about this and that, in no particular sequence, sharing what happens to be on his mind in the moment, sharing it with the reader as if he's right there in the room with you. Some people seem to like this style of writing, others not so much. I did.While the fact that this is not a typical sex, drugs and rock and roll expose may disappoint some, I found it refreshing and endlessly interesting. Waging Heavy Peace is a window into the mind of a deep, complex and multifaceted person. What's actually revealed is very rich, goes far beyond the music alone, and in so doing provides a context for better understanding Young's remarkable creativity.So apart from the music, the life, and the relationships, we learn about the author's passion for old cars, model trains, the environment and appropriate energy sources, ultra high quality sound, the archiving of this and that and various permutations and combinations of all of the above rolled together into one. It's fascinating.To get a feel for what this is like, here's a snippet on Neil's work with Lionel, the iconic model train brand:""During the development of what is now Lionel's system for control of action and sound on a model railroad, I became obsessed. There are so many ways to model the actions and sounds of a machine like a locomotive, it is endless - and the complexity is like a drug. For instance, every action has a sound, and every sound has variables. Every sound variable needs an algorithm based on an action, and every action needs a variable control mechanism and a sensor to monitor its position or at least predict its position, possibly based on the positions of other related moving parts of the machine's systems. To me this is a stimulant. I am fascinated by it, by all of the possibilities. Every sound needs to be recorded in such a way that it is variable by an algorithm based on the mechanical action of by the controller. You can see how I get hung up.The end result is music.""Indeed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMNSKZLDCBDQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399159460#wasThisHelpful","RMNSKZLDCBDQ6","A204G7E13UW2B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204G7E13UW2B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stillwater trout are tough.In a lake or pond they'll move around in search of food; you search for them in different places under different conditions. These environments provide wide menu options for our favorite fish - fly selection can be a daunting challenge. And water that doesn't move allows the trout plenty of time to study and critique your presentation. If it isn't dead spot on, nothing doing.On the other hand, these same conditions allow trout to grow larger in stillwater than they ever would in a stream.

"An unidentified enemy darkens the sunny and idyllic world of our favorite Upper East Side crocodile.The book begins with a quick inventory of those who do love Lyle. There seemingly are no exceptions; this section ends with a picture of Lyle in the park, looking somewhat like Saint Francis of Assisi, birds perching on his head, kittens nestling up against him as butterflies flit about and a happy squirrel approaches. The caption reads, ""And in return Lyle loved the whole, wide, wonderful world. He didn't have one single enemy in it... or so he thought"".I must digress to talk about Waber's exceptional illustrations. The expressions of abject adoration that he manages impart to the drawings of Lyle's admirers are simply astonishing. Forty years after its creation, his art has a vintage feel, but is so expressive and loaded with detail, that it will hold the attention of readers of all ages.Anyway, getting back to the story, the love fest is interrupted by a note signed, ""Your enemy"" and stating, ""I hate you"".In the next section of the book Lyle confronts the pain of rejection, while the Primm family, with whom he lives, tries to discover the identity of the hate monger. All the while the nasty notes keep coming. Mrs. Primm and Lyle even come across the scrawled graffiti, ""Down With Crocodiles"".Eventually, the sleuthing pays off and the enemy is identified as Clover Sue Hipple, a little girl whose family has recently moved into the neighborhood. All of Clover Sue's friends love Lyle and play with him, but Mrs. Hipple won't let CS join in the fun. Hence the animosity.Another digression, this one dealing with the genius of Waber's choice of names. A little girl, new in the neighborhood and named Clover Sue Hipple? This is rich, and contributes to the bizarre atmosphere that ascribes normalcy to the clearly abnormal condition of a highly civilized reptilian, at home on the streets of Manhattan. The better known William Steig later carried this tradition of zany names to a much wider audience.Anyway, in the end all is well. Redemption reigns and enmity is overcome.

"Tempest is a violent album. There's a lot of fighting going on, and a lot of dying too. It's bleak, stark, and kind of scary...It's also quite remarkable. Dylan never ceases to amaze, setting off in unexpected new directions even at age 71.In Scarlet town you fight your father's foesUp on the hill a chilly wind blowsYou fight em on high and you fight em down inYou fight em with whiskey, morphine and ginWhat's going on here?Dylan in 2012, talking to Rolling Stone about Tempest: ""I wanted to make something more religious. I just didn't have enough [religious songs]"".Dylan in 1965 talking to reporters at a press conference: ""I'm not on drugs. I just have a nervous disorder"".Hmmm...Anyway, this time around Bob goes on to comment that it's an album, ""where anything goes and you just gotta believe it will make sense"".So it is, and yeah, so you do.Much has been written about the darkness that shrouds the songs of Tempest. And yes, dark it is indeed, as may befit the times. Dylan's always been adept at pointing out which way the wind is blowing and sometimes it ain't pretty. The times they are a changin', but not necessarily for the better.And so it starts with Duquesne Whistle,Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowingBlowing like it's gonna sweep my world away...Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowingBlowing like the sky's gonna blow apartListen to that Duquesne whistle blowingBlowing like it's gonna kill me dead...And so, only a few verses into Tempest, death makes its entrance, and stays there pretty much to the end.The sound of all this is taut - like something's going to snap at any moment. It's blues / rock with banjo, violin and accordion woven in, and over it all Dylan's voice; broken, tattered, tortured and torn, perfect for expressing the shadows that seem to grip the songwriter's soul in his seventy first year.Next up is Soon After Midnight, which on the surface sounds like a light hearted ditty. But listen closer:My heart is cheerful it's never fearfulI've been down on the killing floorsI'm in no great hurryI'm not afraid of your furyI've faced stronger walls than yoursIn Narrow Way things get a bit gruesome...Ever since the British burned the White House downThere's a bleeding mood in the heart of townI saw you drinking from an empty cupI saw you buried and I saw you dug upIt's a long road; it's a long and narrow waySure is.Look at what's going on in Long and Wasted Years:My enemy crashed into the dustStopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lustHe was run down hard and he broke apartHe died in shame, he had an iron heartI wear dark glasses to cover my eyesThere are secrets in `em that I can't disguiseNo doubt.Pay in Blood takes us to an even bleaker place.Night after nightDay after dayThey strip your uselessHopes awayThe more I takeThe more I giveThe more I dieThe more I live.And then the eerie and hypnotic Scarlet Town. Sounding a bit like Man in Long Black Coat comingled with Senor (Tales of Yankee Power), Dylan takes us through the haunted streets:In Scarlet Town in the hot noon hoursThere's palm leaf shadows and scattered flowersBeggars crouching at the gateHelp comes, but it comes too lateBy marble slabs and in fields of stoneYou make your humble wishes knownI touched the garment but the hem was tornIn Scarlet Town where I was bornDid Bob really say that he didn't have enough religious songs? Or is he just sprinkling in the imagery for the fun of it?The mayhem continues in Early Roman Kings.I can strip you of lifeStrip you of breathShip you on downTo the house of deathThe next song, Tin Angel is a sinister and urgent telling of a tale of a love triangle that ends in blood. Here's how Dylan sets up the arrival of the avenger:Well he threw down his helmetAnd his cross handled swordHe renounced his faithHe denied his lordHe crawled on his bellyPut his ear to the wallOne way or another gonna end it all.And then the final two songs - Tempest, about the sinking of the Titanic and Roll on John, about the murder of John Lennon.So.Bob sets out to write a bunch of religious songs and comes up with darkness, death, murder and mayhem. I guess you just have to take him at his word when he says ""...you just gotta believe it will make sense"".Along the way it'll give you a lot to think about. And it'll grab a hold of you too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKCH9ORIVIU0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008OGJXJ6#wasThisHelpful","RKCH9ORIVIU0Y","A204G7E13UW2B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204G7E13UW2B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The only reason I own a pair of these is because I sometimes fish in Vermont.In their wisdom, the authorities in that greenest of states have decided to ban the use of felt sole wading boots.Wear 'em and you're in line for a fine.This regulation is presumably in the interest of preventing the spread of rock snot and other nasty invasive species. An admirable goal, no doubt about it.But, what about foreign hitch hikers on the laces, threads, tucked in crannies, on various seams and other areas of waders, etc. etc. etc.? Felt is far from the only place for these critters to hide. As a result, a primitive ban such as implemented by Vermont won't effectively reduce the spread of invasives, while it will certainly put fishermen at risk of dangerous falls.I speak from experience. Notwithstanding the ""sticky"" soles I've landed on my keister every time I've worn these things. And I'm not talking about challenging wading situations; when wearing these any wet rock you encounter becomes a dangerous hazard.I also own two pairs of the otherwise identical felt soled Riverwalkers - they're my favorite boots.

"These are my favorite wading boots. They're comfortable, very light, and provide great grip on slippery rocks.Hence the characterization as delightful.On the other hand, after one season of use they are falling apart. Apparently the flip side of their light weight is that they are in fact lightweight, almost to the point of being flimsy.Therefore the reference to their being diaphanous.In my book, however, delight trumps diaphanousness (this really is a word, I looked it up).I just bought a new pair to use while the originals are being repaired.

"Of what?A literary form that I refer to as ""Grandiloquent Piscatorial Musing"". Key elements of this genre of fishing book include the use of esoteric vocabulary, outrageous similes, and long and complex sentences. Until I read The Longest Silence, I considered James R. Babb the unchallenged master of this field. Now, I'd have to say he has a strong contender in the form of Thomas McGuane. Here are some examples from The Longest Silence: - At an ancient monastery outside Dublin accessed by a stone causeway over fast water, pierced by a circular opening for the angling convenience of the friars, I imagined that they sought the trout and salmon with the down-winged, bright fly that was born in early times on the spate rivers of the Celtic world, in Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and perhaps Cornwall. - Each year, Jim Harrison came down for a long stay and lowered already abysmal standards of decency wherein the awful polarity of our nightlife and daytime striving on the sea places us all within easy reach of professional custodians. - Yet, when the serious angler insinuates himself into the luminous, subaqueous universe of the bonefish and catches one without the benefit of accident, he has, in effect, visited another world, one whose precise cycles and conditions appear so serene that the addled twentieth-century angler begins to be consoled for all he has done to afford the trip in the first place.What is it about fishing that inspires people to write like this?Who knows?

The Mouse That Snored, a great book by Bernard Waber, the author of the classic Lyle the Crocodile series, deals with similarly troublesome snoring but has a happy ending (which I won't disclose) and provides a possible solution to the problem.The story takes place in the home of a very quiet family. Here's how the author sets the context:Once there was a quiet manas quiet as a mouse.He lived in the countryin a very quiet house.The quiet man's quiet wifepadded about in slippers.She never made the faintest soundnot even while zipping zippers.They had a catnamed Mose,who went abouton tippy toes.And a parrotnamed Will,Whose only words were""Hush! Be still!""These four characters go about their lives placing a premium on maintaining silence at all costs. So for instance,The quiet man, the quiet woman,the quiet cat and bird,ate their dinner, sipped their drink,and never spoke a word.Nor would they dare eat noisy foodlike crunchy celery, munchy radishesor a snappy carrot,- not even the parrot.They ate instead,stewed tomatoes,mashed potatoes,and puddings made of bread.So you can imagine the mayhem which follows when a city mouse with an ear splitting snore invades the peaceful scene...But in the end all is well.Not only is this beautifully illustrated book lots of fun to read, but it also conveys valuable themes about diversity, compassion, forgiveness, and openness to change.Important messages, not only for kids, but also for sixty something year old married couples.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZBW2GT5J7R5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007K5BTE4#wasThisHelpful","R1ZBW2GT5J7R5Z","A204G7E13UW2B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204G7E13UW2B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The also have discolorment all around the front half of foot.IF these had been up to NEW non-defective and non-damaged Fluevog standard, they would have been beautifulAs for fitting - they fit as expected but to walk in them feels a bit odd in the heel area like it slides up a bit when walking (even when fitting properly).As for holding up (If they had been in new condition)…I wouldnt expect them to hold up long at all. The leather wraps all around to underside of sole and scratches easily. The light stitches are no where near enough to hold it together with much use.

I own nearly a dozen Miz Mooz shoes and these are the only ones I've had to return…and it is sad because they are really beautiful -- just not functionally comfy or supportive.You can tie the tops tight but that didnt help the issue for me with the sides being so loose, low riding and too wide.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D5NWJ7WRX6IO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009TTBM3C#wasThisHelpful","R1D5NWJ7WRX6IO","A5QQRB2QOY96U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QQRB2QOY96U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"these are beautiful but I give the low stars for a few reasons - mainly because the crystals come off extremely easily and many were off when they arrived before ever wearing.they run apx  size small and are very high so they are quite hard on your feet.The inner soles are a nice quality leather though but the little padding there is stops before reaching your toe area where all your weight rests.they look like the pics but maybe slightly more pinkish than purplish.Very pretty - come apart easily and straps are worn away from poor buckle construction.

The toe bed is plenty wide and high to fit anyone who doesn't have unusually large or deformed foot issues. The velcro strap is easy to adjust to create a perfect fit. The short heel is nice and isnt felt at all….just feels like walking in padded flats.

"I wear a true 7 in shoes and order a 7.5 in boots to accommodate socks.I got the Leopard boots in a 7.5.Mine had a few glue marks on the hair on the boots & heel but even said, theseare truly stunning just to look at.I'm returning (in part for glue marks but also) for the following reasons:They run small - at least ½ size and the pull tag is too little to actually use.They are a little hard to get on and harder to take off.They arent made too well-the gold plate around front of toe area ispartly coming off on one side and you can see that it is cheap and will bend, scratch,and come off easily if bumped. Also, the heel is poorly constructed (pieces stacked, not solid)that chip off and break easily.When shoes are on, the top sides buckle out and make your feet look like duck feet.The soles are extremely hard and there is no room for padding as the fit is so tight...not only in length but in the sole to top of foot height. I have thin, slightly narrow feet andthe width is fine but the height is too tight even with only thin hose. And the ankle fitis too loose and stretches out when taking them on and off so it looks & feels odd.The hair/leather comes all the way down to floor so it will be impossible to keep them clean.Bottom line - not made as well as I'd like, VERY uncomfortable and hard, tight fit around footand loose fit around ankle and glue marks are reasoning I'm returning them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ELQWVIZJIQ32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOSAFVS#wasThisHelpful","R2ELQWVIZJIQ32","A5QQRB2QOY96U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QQRB2QOY96U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I gave only 1 star because they aren't wearable.They are ok looking, MUCH MUCH more shiny and cheap looking in person.But the worst thing is the design flaw.I have a true size 7 foot and narrow. I ordered up to a 7.5 per other reviews.It took literally 4 minutes to get a foot in them - could only get in one, and just barely and then almost couldnt get it off.Aside from the stiff zippers that stick, even with the zipper all the way open, it doesnt open the boot up much.The problem in design and getting into them is caused by the rounded area around the sides and back part of the heel. It is stiff and the fabric above is soft. There is no pull tab and the opening isn't large enough to get your foot in without the heel folding under your foot.I think you would need to be 2 sizes larger to get the heel in but then you'd have too much room in the front of the boot as the front part only, seems to be a true size/fit.The bottom/soles have felt. In the pics, they look classy but in person they look like an old couch your great-grandma might have.Only thing positive I can say about them is the material is fairly soft to the touch (which of course will make it wear and stain more easily though).","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BS946Y9WTEA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQWY7TG#wasThisHelpful","R2BS946Y9WTEA7","A5QQRB2QOY96U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QQRB2QOY96U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Its cute but I've bought many less expensive ones that didnt look as cheap as this one does. The material isn't nice at all. Some faux patent bags look nice and some look like cheap plastic, this one looks like cheap plastic. The shape is odd as well, perhaps from them folding it to store and mail but it won't reshape. The inside pocket looks like a white zip lock baggie…really, really, cheap, thin, plastic that tears easily. There is no lining inside. The seams are stitched fairly well but due to the rigidity of the material, they look as though they'll crack and pull apart easily.The outer bow has unnderseams (glued, not stitched) that were already coming apart when I got mine.

"So sad, I have to return them. I said they fit as expected meaning true to size but they are different than normal Donald Pliners. Normally, Donald Pliners always run a size small so I ordered a size 8 for my size 7 feet. They are too big. I have many Pliners but none that are the ""Lisa"" by pliner, so I've learned they fit differently apparently. Since they are out of 7 or 7.5 I just have to return them. I am so sad because they are fabulous. I have so much trouble finding flats I like due to poor design but these are so well designed and made. They are heavy, sturdy, thick wall construction and good support - all while actually being comfortable.

"I got these in the leopard print. Knowing & loving Donald Pliner shoes, I know they run small so I ordered up.I wear a true 7. I order a 7.5 usually in boots to be able to accommodate wearing socks with them. In this, I ordered the size 8 knowing how Pliners run small. It was good I did, also with the pointed toe. They fit well in the 8 with thin socks. I also have a slightly narrow foot (which is good considering Pliners are always narrow).These are pretty for sure but I didnt think they looked quite as nice in person (which is the opposite reaction I normally have with Pliners).The leopard print is painted on and had a couple minor flaws that looked a bit on the tacky side.Otherwise, they look nice-they went on and off easily/nicely. Smooth zipper action, etc.******I am RETURNING them - here is why:I'm not great with high heels and 3.5 is my absolute max heel height if there is no platform to help.These are listed as having a 3.5 inch heel, but it is actually just barely under 4"" tall (apx. 3 ⅞"").With that angle, it makes the ball of the foot feet really hard when walking and it hurt just taking a couple steps (for me).In addition, the boot comes up just a little too high for that high of an angle/heel, making it cut into the back of your leg a bit…not horribly, but enough to be uncomfortable after just a min. or two.All this said, if you are good with high heels, have narrow feet, and don't mind a slight discomfort in the name of fashion, then you'd probably be happy with these.For me, any shoe near or over $100 must be incredible to look at and incredibly comfortable for me to justify the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XYJ9JWNQY1K0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ASOY2CA#wasThisHelpful","R1XYJ9JWNQY1K0","A5QQRB2QOY96U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QQRB2QOY96U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are beautiful shoes! The reason for my low rating is the style and sizing. They run apx  size small but sizing up (even if it were available-which it isnt) wont help because the flap on top is very loose and if the shoe fit normally, the foot would slip out of shoe when walking. The flap needed to be stitched a bit further down to prevent this. But they are gorgeous to look at - just cant wear them. In addition, the soles are hard with no padding and extremely slippery. I know with wearing, the slick wears off but because the soles are also very thin, I'm afraid that when scuffed, they will wear away quickly and get holes in the bottom.

"I have 9 pair of United Nude shoes made with this elastic material and they all run consistent in being just a little tight/smaller than normal.That said, I am a solid size 7 and I have a slightly narrow foot, but ordered a size 8 in this shoe to accommodate UN sizing.I could barely even squeeze into them. These run a FULL 2 sizes too small.I don't think ordering up another size will help as the way they are constructed is odd and in areas they fold when you walk - hard to put into words. Certain areas are bulky while other areas are too small.As for the 1 star rating: I love the fabric (that is why I have 9 pair in other styles with it), but the way the rubber sides come up over the top looks ugly and adds to the heavy and bulky nature of this particular style. That combined with not being able to get a size that will fit is the reason for my low rating.

"This is adorable when laid out on the bed.  As a garment, it's worthless. I am 5'9"" and 135lbs. I ordered a large as the others reviewers have recommended and it fits, but is nearly too large.  My hips are 38"" and my waist is 29"". The garter elastics are very long and the small adjuster won't stay up, so I stitched mine. They are almost short enough on the SHORTEST adjustment and my inseam is 34"". I am very leggy and I think this would be way too long for a shorter person, or a tall person with normal proportions, so be ready to alter it.The clips are plastic.

"I am a parent to 9 year old boy who is dyslexic.  We are non-religious homeschoolers who spend quite a lot of time out at museum and other classes and co-ops.  My son has never experienced any bullying in regards to dyslexia or otherwise.  He has also never experienced the nasty behavior described in the friendships in this book.  Had he already been part of that, I think this would be a fine book that he could relate to.  However, I did not end up reading it to him because I think it would introduce neagative thoughts that he currently doesn't worry about.For a child who has experienced the common public school issues addressed in this book, I think it is well written and on target.  It ends very upbeat and practical.  But, I cannot recommend it to a child who has not experienced these negatives.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D4MCLUUY5FON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0590449222#wasThisHelpful","R1D4MCLUUY5FON","A23KZ0TXHGU110","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23KZ0TXHGU110?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This dress is absolutely lovely.  It's well made, high quality cotton.  The pattern is gorgeous, the colors vivid.  The medium fits true to their sizing chart.  I am 5'9"", 34C-28-36.The lining of the bust area is a stretchy, thin material.  It was cut a bit smaller than the outer cotton and thus on my 34C chest, the cotton wouldn't quite lay right.  A larger bust would stretch the lining and make it lay perfectly, as evidenced when I stuck a couple breast pads in my bra cups to see what would happen.  That said, I'm not interested in bigger boobs, so I took the dress to the tailor and had it altered.  The job was $15 and now it lays absolutely perfectly on my un-enhanced chest.The dress was perfect for a Mad Men theme potluck, and is also lovely for date nights, summer weddings, etc.  I have several Lindy Bop dresses and while I love them all, this might just be my favorite.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NV85P1MWON6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5KGKRO#wasThisHelpful","R1NV85P1MWON6T","A23KZ0TXHGU110","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23KZ0TXHGU110?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The car is very cool, no doubt. I bought 2 of these so my kids can race them, but my 5 year old doesn't drive hers a lot. But, I have a 9 year old who runs the car a considerable amount and the differential gears were skipping within 3 days. I took it apart and put ball bearings in it and it seems to work better. The nylon bushings that come with the car just aren't sufficient and soon they will allow a lot of 'slop' in the mechanisms. The wheels bushings were worn, and pretty much worn out within 24 hours. The thing is, when you have a powerful R/C car, you really need to have metal internals. I imagine this car will be fun for a long time, but I will be fixing and upgrading it...alot.There are plenty of parts and kits online and at my local shop to upgrade this car into a useable R/C car that will last and be fun, but it's not going to last out of the box.Remember that you get what you pay for, so anything in this price range is going to be sketchy and basically the same.My son has been into R/C cars for quite some time and knows how to drive it, does not crash it into things, etc. There is no misuse going on here.Traxxas needs to pull this product, do a quick redesign on the gears and bushings and then it will be worth the money.

"We used these on a ladies BMX pro cruiser and ladies pro xl class bike. This kit includes the BB and (3) 2.5mm shims. You will need to install the shims (2) for the 68mm bottom bracket and adjust the freewheel or cassette gear out 2mm or you get an offset chain line which is noisy, causes chain wear and could cause a chain to derail. You can buy a pack of 1mm spacers on Amazon that work just right. I consider this crank a very good crank, but I would limit the rider weight to 150lbs or so (only for BMX use.) Not that they would break, just to limit flex. However, they flex less then 90% of the cranks out there with no weight limit. These are not quite as beefy as the Saints but are lighter and great for a light rider. I think these are a really under utilized product. Like all Shimano products, they are well built, nicely packaged and look good. I really DON'T like the finish on these, though. It's a dark gray textured paint. They would look even better polished. The finish is powder coat, so it's tough and polishing would take some time.These are an excellent and cost effective alternative over Shimano DXR cranks ($450) for any lighter BMX rider.

Hope US jumps on this soon, so much more accurate when measuring knitting also, not just food and liquids.Liked the part about when the coal miners would weigh the coal brought up vs the weight they bought at the store-2 totally different measurements.I received this book from National Library Service for my BARD (Braille Audio Reading Device).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZL4F8JNXSDEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000X6A9A2#wasThisHelpful","R1ZL4F8JNXSDEF","A37BRR2L8PX3R2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37BRR2L8PX3R2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Catch of a Lifetime by Candee FickWanted to read this book because it's about football and I do enjoy watching a good game.This one starts out with Cassie and she's the new assistant sports therapist for the team. She's relocated from Georgia to Colorado, attending classes at the same college and living on campus as well as getting paid to do her job.Story is also about Reed who's trying to prove to himself and his relatives that he can live on his own and be a good coach for the football team, mentoring the playing and helping them grow up.What I liked about this book was the detailed knowledgeable information, not only about the play by play action during the football games, but techniques used for taping different bones in one's body.Got confusing at times with all the players and all the coaches involved but during the book it becomes clear where they all fit in.A football player had caused her father to die, we learn and she talks to a friend about her past.  She also has had to live through the pain of returning to that town with her new football team to aid along the sidelines when she learns what the head football player is doing with his second chance.Just when things are going good for them, whether it's a good or bad idea that they don't tell others of their dating, a bad event occurs that riles everybody as they are about to head off to a big gameThroughout the book they each pray to the Lord for guidance and help them get through another difficult crisis. Like how she and others are able to work through and move on with their life. I received this book from  Book Club Network  (bookfun.org) in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SIH5JENJXKPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941103944#wasThisHelpful","R3SIH5JENJXKPK","A37BRR2L8PX3R2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37BRR2L8PX3R2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Trouble by Olivia MyersWas invited to read this and post reviews and looked at the synopsis and thought it'd be a good fit for the books I do read.Starts out with Duke who runs his own bar, Shotguns. Alexi walks in surveying the place and heads to the bar where Duke is. She wants the job of waitress.She is trying to prove that she can complete college and not use any of her daddy's money. The story is fast paced and colorful and imaginative with what they have.There are physical attractions to one another and we learn of Duke's story and about the business.  Liked learning about rock climbing and some new words, which I look up to make sure I fully understand them.Steamy hot sex scene but neither of them want to do a repeat. Lexi is a business major and he just may have the solution of his problems. With such detailed descriptions you can play the scenes in your head, as if you were right there. Free book at the end of this.Another book is included: along with an excerpt of yet another book. .“Pleasure In The Stars” by Olivia Myers.This story is about a trip 3 women take to another planet. for pleasure.

"Vacationland by Nat GoodaleWanted to read this book for a few reasons; it's about lobstering off the coast of Maine and sounded like a good read.It was so much more than that! I am from an island off the coast and know exactly what the author means when it comes to dealing with the offislanders in your own way.It's the code and they must abide by the rules. Newcomers come to live on the island and want things to go according to their new rules. Makes the whole concept of living on an island the opposite. you go there to get away from the mainland, noise, hubbub, etc.They want to change it all. Donny is the local lobsterman and what I liked about him was that he uses his hands to do his career. Love all the real technical words for parts of his boat, traps, etc.  He has many obstacles in life: a new girlfriend, another lobsterman trying to fish on top of his own traps and the new neighbors who don't like much about him and his living area.Each of the others get alternating chapters during the book so you're kept abreast of what's going on from their perspective. Past years are detailed that help with the missing pieces of the puzzle.It all comes to a head one day and Shelly, his girl finds out things that make her put things into action. Never expected what happened next and the plan as it takes form. Just when you think you know how it will end, there's more twists and turns.Hadn't expected the romance scenes either but were most welcome. Super read, all around, action, adventure, mysteries, romance, travel, everyday work of a lobsterman. Can't wait to read more from this author!

ThomasBack to the warehouse where the group is researching the powers....Loved hearing what color witches do what spells and about their powers.Calibrated devices are having some strange results...memory extraction techniques sound so intense as there are many aspects to it.Whether the procedure will work is another story....different rules for different  dimensions... can the species work together or is the world doomed as we know it?Things really heat up and they must escalate to the next level-getting the government involved=can this possibly even work?Fast paced action found listening to this a better experience but reread the print version to get an even closer look at the fine points.Felt like I got a better handle on what was happening in this series and can't wait to read the next one.book 3 should be another super read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R239ST6BN0X6EQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CVTD4E#wasThisHelpful","R239ST6BN0X6EQ","A37BRR2L8PX3R2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37BRR2L8PX3R2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Her father takes her back to live in the city, Paris with her, He runs a bookstore. She is sent to her sisters as the Germans invade the city.Obstacles keep her from getting directly there and she must survive the hardship of having no one.What I like about this authors writing is there is usually a few stories in the book, entwined together.I received this book from National Library Service for my BARD (Braille Audio Reading Device).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FXCQ7LE8ZF20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312577222#wasThisHelpful","R1FXCQ7LE8ZF20","A37BRR2L8PX3R2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37BRR2L8PX3R2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This device works and looks great. Unlike most other reviewers, I bought this device to sit on my computer desk so I can switch a secondary monitor between my desktop pc, laptop, Surface 3 tablet and an iMac (instead of using it for my home theater). The front face LED's look great and clue me in as to which machine is currently active on the secondary monitor. I had a Belkin HDMI 4-port switch but it was powered by the HDMI connection, which made it switch connections automatically when something occurred on a machine. That was really annoying. Since this device has its own power adapter, it stays where I put it until I hit a button on the remote. Also, since it is self powered, all machines think they are still connected at all times, so switching between machines does not disturb the screen savers (I run Display Fusion on all to display photos on multiple monitors when I am not using a particular machine). Another plus in the design is that all 4 input ports are lined up on the back side, with the output port on the left side. This makes for much better cable management (as opposed to the Belkin with 3 input ports on back side, and 1 input port on the front side). The construction is also far more solid and sound, as well as cosmetically appealing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGQZ4H97ZPWN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9642JS#wasThisHelpful","RGQZ4H97ZPWN9","A10RUUOX5HA7V8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10RUUOX5HA7V8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It works fine as a touch tablet. I was a little disappointed to discover it did not have built-in GPS. That meant I had to buy a separate blue tooth GPS (which I did, and it works fine also) and a map software that uses blue tooth GPS (Maps Pro). The main reason I have tablets is for road trips. I also have a Samsung Galaxy and it has built-in GPS and comes with Google Maps. It is still the best mapping device for road trips.The Surface 3 has a 1.6Ghz processor so don't expect to be running any power hungry apps on it (like Quicken for example). I have since upgraded the 8.1 OS to Win10 OS and that was a definite improvement in overall GUI performance and useability. BTW: I also upgraded one of my older laptops to Win10, played with it for 2 days, and then reverted back to Win7. From my perspective, Win10 is designed for tablets and phones that have significantly lower CPU power. The overall GUI of Win10 has been dumbed down to a flat, 2D appearance which I found significantly less appealing than Win7, but works great on tablets like the Surface 3.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8JNHFUXKVUV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGIRP62#wasThisHelpful","R8JNHFUXKVUV0","A10RUUOX5HA7V8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10RUUOX5HA7V8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Awesome! I am amazed at the huge time reduction at boot up since I installed this SSD drive and moved my C drive to it. Before, I would fire up the PC and go do some chores for a few minutes. Even then, after logging in it still took another 1-2 minutes for the system to get settled in. Now, I can actually sit down and boot up the PC, see the log-in screen within 15 seconds, log in, and be ready to work within another 15 seconds. What put me onto this was that my latest PC addition, an MSI Work Station Laptop, came with an SSD C drive and a 1Tb D drive. It stunned me at how fast it booted up (with all of my graphics and engineering software also loaded on it). This led me to investigate why. That's when I learned about the latest SSD drives, and how to install the drive and migrate the OS. Also, launch time for apps while working has increased by at least 500%! However, I would recommend that anyone who chooses to make this upgrade also install an OS backup software and get in the habit of backing up your C drive periodically. From what I have read, although SSD technology has improved considerably over the last few years, they still have a significantly shorter lifespan than mechanical hard drives; at this time anyway.One side NOTE: The migration software that came with the drive (from Samsung) did NOT work. After several attempts at following the directions completely (pretty much wasted a whole day) I finally gave up and went to Best Buy and bought a SATA to USB 3.0 cable adapter kit. The one I bought, Apricorn, also came with its own migration software, but it also did not work. So I downloaded EaseUs Partition Master (free) and used it with the SATA to USB 3.0 cable. That worked flawlessly. In fact, I highly recommend using both of EaseUs softwares (free for home use): ToDo Backup (for the C drive backup) and Partition Master (for the OS migration).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HR8YNTQ6WFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OAJ412U#wasThisHelpful","R1HR8YNTQ6WFM","A10RUUOX5HA7V8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10RUUOX5HA7V8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well made. They do exactly what I wanted them for: To reorganize some older DVD box sets into easier-to-use cases. Since they have outer wraps for printed sleeves, it becomes an interesting project to scan the old cases and resize and print for these cases. It all worked well. It took me a bit of time to get used to the rigid behavior of the hub buttons on the booklet tabs: One has to press pretty hard to get the discs to snap into place. The only negative aspect to this order is the shipping speed. I guess I have become spoiled by Amazon having distribution hubs everywhere. This product comes from one location somewhere in the NE corner of the U.S.; probably NY. I am in the NW corner. It took 4 days to ship the order once placed, and another 7 days to arrive. The compensation for this is the price of the product: Significantly lower than other brands. I would definitely recommend this product for those wanting to condense their video library for saving space, and also for retiring bulky and somewhat aging original cases. Oh, one more thing: The booklet tabs actually snap securely into each side of the case so that when you first open a full case they don't flop around, possibly tossing the discs around.

"This wallet has turned out to be exactly what I expected. Contrary to other reviews, I find it not too difficult to get the cards in and out of the pockets. Obviously, if they were too loose they would fall out (and get lost) when one turns the wallet upside down. Compared to previous wallets I have owned, this one is easier than most. IMHO, the smell is no more offensive than any other newly purchased leather item (belt, shoes, etc) and is equivalent to that ""new car smell"", which has already begun to wear off.The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because putting receipts into the wallet is an almost impossible task. Perhaps if one side had been opened at least half-way at the top to allow better insertion, that might have been better. Also, I would have really appreciated it if the wallet had been RFID protected so I could store my Enhanced Driver License in the clear pocket. As it is, I have to store it in an RFID sleeve, which renders the clear pocket somewhat useless.So, basically, the ""perfect"" wallet would have been: (a) this size with this number of pockets, (b) better receipt insertion design, and (c) RFID protected.

After getting used to some minor quirks in the beginning, it worked great for my needs. It eventually wore out recently and I decided to buy another one and continue my cooking habits. Bad mistake. Right out of the box it does not ever reach any temp that will even begin to cause a sizzle of any kind. The temp just sits there and blinks. I tried different warm up methods; N/G. This is a huge disappointment and waste of money. The QA team at the G.F. factory must have all quit long ago and no one has been checking the product since. I read some other reviews that have reported pretty much the same issue. I will be donating this to Goodwill and buying a Quisinart Griller instead. It has great reviews.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RS07Y6AFB3I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002KINSY#wasThisHelpful","R1RS07Y6AFB3I6","A10RUUOX5HA7V8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10RUUOX5HA7V8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought my first Dyson in 2007, a DC17. I was immediately impressed with its superior vacuum capabilities, the design and unique features, and the outstanding extension of the hose/nozzle. For 7 years I have told friends and acquaintances that no other vacuum cleaner comes close to a Dyson.I recently inherited my mother's estate and was forced to relocate temporarily to the other side of the country. I was limited in what I brought with me from my house so I naturally researched the latest Dyson technology. As it turned out, they (and Amazon) were offering a free DC34 Hand-Held with the purchase of this DC65.I was amazed at how much further the DC65 had surpassed the DC17! The suction is significantly better, both on carpet and on floors. I have no problem manipulating it on hardwood floors, and it does a very good job on them. This unit glides better on carpet as well. And, the ""rolling ball"" feature is a definite plus.I have not tried any other vacuums for years, but I doubt anyone can produce a better vacuum than the DC65. I only hope Dyson does not produce another, better version too soon so I can get some years out of this one.  :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M8DNQYQCVDXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNUFRQC#wasThisHelpful","R1M8DNQYQCVDXW","A10RUUOX5HA7V8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10RUUOX5HA7V8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't waste your money. I was looking forward to seeing an older movie that I enjoyed many years ago on DVD, as with many others that I have bought. The resolution was so bad it looked like they used a cheap, hand-held video camera and filmed the VHS version on a large LED TV. I have never seen a DVD look this bad. They absolutely did not put ANY effort into up-scaling the resolution. It's so bad it isn't watchable and I'm very disappointed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35KYJ57EIWP7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ARDC16#wasThisHelpful","R35KYJ57EIWP7U","A10RUUOX5HA7V8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10RUUOX5HA7V8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I previously owned a similar Mr. Coffee model: FTXSS43GTF-1NP, and it finally died after 2.3 years. It had been the over-all best coffee maker I had ever owned, so I went looking for the latest version with the same great features. This model was it. It has made the best pot of coffee of all I have ever tried, and this is important since I have a pot every single day of the year (with rare exceptions). I have never used the programmable features of any coffee maker that I have owned as I would rather keep the coffee grounds fresh until needed. After trying many expensive ($100 plus) and inexpensive ($29 minus) I would say this is the best designed (water tank, coffee basket, etc) and makes the best coffee.In fact, I recently bought a second coffee maker of this exact same model because (after about a year of use) I accidentally tilted the first one the wrong way and water ran into the digital controls. Upon buying the second one I decided to start using the water filter (after reading some review comments). Wow! What a difference that makes! Every new pot of coffee has that fresh brewed, pure coffee taste with no after tastes. My local water supply must have a fair share of chemicals in it that I had not realized was affecting the coffee taste.One final note: I have noticed that over time the interior of all coffee makers develops a buildup of calcium and lime deposits that one cannot easily remove, even with periodic cleaning with vinegar. That being the case, I will probably buy a new coffee maker every couple of years due to that inevitable water deposit buildup, and the next one will probably be the most current version of this model.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I666K57T977C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JNNR7E#wasThisHelpful","R1I666K57T977C","A10RUUOX5HA7V8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10RUUOX5HA7V8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That said, I don't try different brands so I can compare them, so I may be biased. My camera equipment is Canon (for many years) and so my last printer was a Canon IP6000, purchased in 2006, for printing 4x6 photos (and documents). It worked great until recently when it suddenly slowed way down, which is what prompted me to go shopping. Naturally I read the reviews for Canon printers (and some other brands) and it appeared that this one was the newest technology and already had favorable reviews, including from people with home businesses.Now, let's switch gears. My printing needs have diminished over the years as I have become increasingly more digital in document storage, online financial transactions, etc. Basically, if I can do it digitally, then that is the route I take. This includes my photo collection which is stored on my iPad for showing off.  :-)  I also bought a CanoScan 8600F (flatbed scanner) in 2006, which is still in use.So, imagine my very pleasant surprise when I discovered the awesome speed and stream-lined functionality of the multi-sheet scanning feature! If one sets up a directory (in the accompanying software utilities) ahead of time, then it's as simple as loading your documents, hitting either start button (black or color) and very quickly a pdf file shows up in the pre-set directory. Did I mention it has an ethernet port and is quickly (and painlessly) recognized on the network once the drivers are installed? I don't like Wi-Fi for home networking, I prefer ethernet (gigabit speed) when ever I can get it, so this port was a big plus for me. All of my computers see and work with the Fax driver, Printer driver and Scanning driver.Now, let's mention some little things that make this machine great. I never turn it off as it has a low-power state (automatic after a few minutes of inactivity) where everything powers down with only one small, blue light glowing. If I send something to the printer it immediately comes to life, takes a few moments to warm up and (this is cool) the paper output tray *automatically* opens and the extension support flips out! It's the little things that make me smile. :-) Also, if I place one or more documents in the scanner slot (while in low power mode) then it instantly springs to life and takes a few moments to warm up.Having stated that I print less and less these days, I must say I was impressed with the ink cartridges. They all have small, red LED lights that confirm they are plugged in correctly and in working order! Another smile. :-)  Now I don't FAX much these days, but it's nice to know that it is hooked into the ""clone"" line through my PhonePower VOIP adapter (2 ports) and therefore is available upon demand. Oh, btw, the top lifts up like a flatbed scanner also, so I guess I will be donating the CanoScan 8600F soon.Final analysis: This machine's capabilities pleasantly exceeded my expectations, even after reading the specs and reviews. It has proven to be fairly equal in functionality to the Xerox multi-function machine at work, but at a fraction of the cost. The only thing it can't do is print 11x17, but that isn't an issue at this time. I will try to get back in a year to report on it's longevity prospects.UPDATE: I have knocked the rating down to 4 stars because there is no secondary sheet feeder. (My rating for this is actually 4.5 but that choice isn't available). Occasionally I have need to print on 8.5 x 14 (legal). With this unit one must remove the regular paper from the lower (main) paper tray, extend it out (at least they did build that into the unit) and load the 8.5 x 14 paper. I suppose I have been spoiled by top (secondary) sheet feeders on previous printers, so this is a small let-down. I guess I assumed the scanning feeder could be used as a secondary sheet feeder (for printing) but due to the design of the machine it cannot.UPDATE, 11-24-13: I had occasion to send my sister a letter today (she hates email) so I typed one up and hit the print button. I have not printed anything for several months, and the print cartridges are now 7 months old. My letterhead includes a small photo of a sunset over a local river at the bottom. After hitting the print button the machine woke up, flipped out the print tray, spent a minute doing a self-diagnostics, then printed out my one page in about 7 seconds. Apart from a slight smudge at the top (probably due to inactivity for several months) the letter printed out flawlessly, including the photo. I reprinted the letter and there were no smudges or flaws. Since I have not needed ""legal"" size paper anymore, I am changing my rating to 5 stars since this machine is doing everything I need it to do.UPDATE, 05-25-14: I lost my mother on Feb. 1 and inherited her estate. I was forced to move temporarily from WA to KY to liquidate the estate. My first priority was to set up my office so I could deal with the legal, financial and medical accounts and issues. I am also Trustee so there were many Will disbursements to deal with. I did not bring my MX922 from WA, instead I bought a new one once here. After 4 months of scanning, copying, and printing, I can now say I have given this machine a workout, including the printing function. It has performed most excellent. I also needed to buy more ink cartridges and discovered an alternate source (here on Amazon) for cartridges that are: (a) a fraction of the cost of Canon cartridges, (b) still have the same red LED's on them that communicate with the printer and (c) are relatively CLEAR, so one can see how much ink is left. I still cannot comment on photo printing as I am all digital these days when it comes to photography. But I can give this unit 5 stars for being a workhorse in all other areas! I can also say that if one schedules their need for printing envelopes in batches, this unit does that professionally as well.UPDATE, 08-24-15: Earlier in the year I decided to start creating my own greeting cards (using CorelDraw) and printing out 5x7 photos for b-day gifts to relatives and friends (from PhotoShop). Both machines are still working great, and they produce exceptional photos. There are settings within the Canon print drivers that one can play with to improve the photo quality as well. I can also endorse the much cheaper ink cartridges that I buy from Blake Printing Supply on Amazon. I have gone through 2 sets (10 cartridges in a set) and they work great as well. For those wanting to find them, do a search on Amazon for ""MX922 compatible ink cartridges"" and look for Blake Printing Supply.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YETBOUDY5XT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AVWKUJS#wasThisHelpful","R2YETBOUDY5XT3","A10RUUOX5HA7V8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10RUUOX5HA7V8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After trying many expensive ($100 plus) and inexpensive ($29 minus) I would say this has been the best designed (water tank, coffee basket, etc) and made the best coffee. However, recently it has been ""gurgling"" more and more, and has now begun to give the ""all done"" signal before the pot is even half-way filled. It is 2 years and 3 months old, so I guess this is it's life expectancy. If it had lasted longer, I would have given it 5 stars.UPDATE 04-29-13: I have revised this to 5 stars. When this appliance died, I bought the Mr. Coffee BVMC-VMX36 model which is very similar to this one, but has a red anodized top half. It worked great for a year until I accidentally tilted it the wrong way and water ran into the digital controls. However, I decided to buy the exact same model again, as both this model and the red version have the same quality features that I like. I have also noticed that over time the interior develops a buildup of calcium and lime deposits that one cannot easily remove, even with periodic cleaning with vinegar. In that case, I would want to buy a new coffee maker every couple of years due to that inevitable water deposit buildup. Hence, I now rate this model 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ATY16LH6JY14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VIKJAW#wasThisHelpful","R1ATY16LH6JY14","A10RUUOX5HA7V8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10RUUOX5HA7V8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The touch ID works great to. The only disappointing thing was the screen wasn't as responsive with the plastic covering. The sound coming from the speaker was muffled.

"How to begin... Well this book is passionate, filled with the thing that we fear as a country and are dealing with in this moment. It hit close to my fears and my heart.Maya gives us characters that are courageous and selfless, something that we could use a lot of in this world. But the character I admire the most is Honor. Aptly named for she is the passion that we should all try to honor. What she stand for the bravery and the passion that this tiny woman holds... If we could have everyone read this book and see how the world perceives the things that are happening. Well, I think Maya hit this book out of the park, nailing the emotion that we and passion that come out the most when a country or a people are tortured, much less a woman.Hancock, the savior and executioner, lost in the underworld of hate and upheaval, he is who you would want in you corner protecting you from the evil in the world. Never seeing the good in him, he is selfless and yet he is hard.So if you didn't or couldn't guess I absolutely loved this book.As I said before it hits very close to what is happening in the world and Yes Maya was able to capture both the hate and the hope that we all want it all to end.

Which is what I have done, and as I squint to rite this review my am filled with joy that I did read them all together to mee the men of Artistic Prick and their women.But Shelby and Mitch, well they are just what makes romance novels tick for me.Yo have a man that is truly broken from the inside but all hard on the outside dying to fond the missing pieces he lost so violently. He banter with Shelby in gravity lead you to believe that there was something more but when they finally realize it, man the sparks that flew off the page were scorching.Cat's writing is a spell that is cast over you as you read the love and pain that pours from the pages of this book. You won't be able to stop reading, you to will be dreaming of Becky and her love for the man that is in so much pain in this story. Your heart will bleed with the words Cat gives you about how he struggles to do right by Shelby. But most of all you will love how she takes a couple that couldn't stand the sight of one another to heights they never thought possible. That is the gift that Cat Mason has given us with this series. I hope Cat that we get to hear that Skinner and his mohawk will find some sassy mouthed woman to tame him as well, Maybe Ember????If I could give this book and series more than 5 stars I would.  It is simply put, LOVE.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25HA2E0ULW5W6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MFTTD6#wasThisHelpful","R25HA2E0ULW5W6","A20MYFNLY6TGNL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20MYFNLY6TGNL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you’re looking for a quirky, yet relatable, romance novel, this is it. Doing It for Love is about 22-year old Lizzie and her boyfriend (soon-to-be husband) Landon. When Landon proposed to Lizzie, she proposed him a bet, a “no-sex-until-marriage” bet. Lizzie figured that their relationship was in a rut, they were the peas and carrots of relationships rather than strawberries and whipped cream, and she wanted more. So, in order to remedy this, she placed a bet with Landon, in order for them to have the best sex on their first night as husband and wife, they have to hold off on having sex until then, and whoever wins gets to go to their dream honeymoon spot - Sundance for Landon, and the Bahamas for Lizzie, and have the best sex of their lives.The novel itself was extremely funny at points, and I felt like my relationship related to theirs in a way, which I think many women can relate. Cassie Mae hit all the points needed to portray their relationship as happy, yet stuck. The two still loved each other very, very deeply, there was just a lack of spark in certain components in their relationship. I really enjoyed reading this novel, the jokes were funny, the relationship between Lizzie and Landon were adorable, and their friends were pretty great too. However, I would point out that there are a few plot holes, one in particular that was never answered - or at least if it was, I definitely missed it. Although I don’t want to give much away, there was a point where I could have SWORN Landon was cheating on Lizzie with her best friend, Theresa, while Lizzie was hiding in the closet. But context clues makes me believe otherwise. Either way, that night was never addressed. That mystery man that was tucking in a drunken Theresa and sleeping on her couch was never addressed. Although I do have an assumption of who it was, it seemed like such an intense and awkward encounter for Lizzie and a bit odd that Lizzie wouldn’t have even mentioned it. I want to reason that Lizzie was so obsessed with her wedding planning that that moment didn’t even cross her mind after that night… but it just makes me wonder, why was this scene added if it didn’t seem to have any reasoning for it? This part just threw me off a bit. But if you put that scene aside, I’m sure you won’t find too many other plot holes and enjoy the rest of the novel.~Steph","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHZYJYO6EUMNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SPVZBP0#wasThisHelpful","RHZYJYO6EUMNK","A20MYFNLY6TGNL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20MYFNLY6TGNL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you loved One to Hold you will totally love this rendition but with a paranormal twist.I loved reading the Ultra Alpha as Vampire Hunter. Tia did such a great job with her words I could close my eyes and picture his swagger and so much more. The passion that he and Melissa share is more intense with the paranormal twist. The heightened danger of the unknown coming to grab you was so nail biting that I had to put the book down just to take a breather.Patrick and Stuart were so much more swoon worthy with there shape shifting abilities and passion for the women they love and fall for.

Nothing could break that hard shell that he had created for his life, nothing but the woman with the green eyes, Layla.Layla also had a past that she lived with a past that shaped her future, the difference between her and Kace was that she promised to rise above her past and live her life to the fullest on her own terms. Now if only she could get Kace to see the best of himself, see what others see.I loved this story, so much and I will tell you ladies I was reading while working out in the gym.

"Fate. I have read a lot of books that talk about fate bringing you to the one that you are mean to be with and they are all romantic and beautifully painful. But this story of how fate not only brought two people together but molded their lives into one they couldn't stand to live and made each other their salvation, well... it is a lasting imprint on my psyche.Dante a product of greed and nothing else although the person that made him was deluded enough to think otherwise. He brutalized his childhood and created a weapon, scarred and filled with revenge.Ryleigh was also created by the same man but what he thought he destroyed survived and has come back albeit unknown to the three of them to haunt him.No two people were made perfectly for each other at the hands of the same evil, but they found their other half. The missing pieces of their souls ripped at a young age only to be thrown together in the most unimaginable way.This is why this story is so powerful, because they fell and fought it from the beginning although he fought harder than she did.But, together they make the most beautiful of mayhem and destruction that you can't help but to be sucked into Dante and his <i>little wolf</i>.A powerful story that is more than darkness, it is more than romance, it is more than revenge, simply put it is <b>FATE</B>A book worthy of any and all shelves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18N4JQVKRY2VE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015G740YS#wasThisHelpful","R18N4JQVKRY2VE","A20MYFNLY6TGNL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20MYFNLY6TGNL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow, can I say amazing!  I'm totally in love with this story.  It's wonderful to see a character like Kinsey in romantic novels.  She's a fire cracker!  Strong, sexy, and very much opinionated.  Yet, a moment of weakness lead her to Chicago where Mr. July; Luke Almeida ignites a fire that she thought was long gone.Luke is one of Chicago's elite firefighters whose arrogance and ill temper has lead him and his firehouse Engine 6 under public scrutiny.  Kinsey is Chicago's best PR personal who is sent to lead the "" Clean Up Luke Almeida's Image"".  Of course this turns out to be a big challenge for both Kinsey and Luke who are both stubborn.Luke is quickly attracted to Kinsey's spark.  Both had been in previous relationships where they felt restraint both in their physical and emotional aspects of the relationship.  Kinsey's a woman who is experienced and knows what she wants and is not afraid to say it.  It's liberating to see a character like Kinsey who is comfortable with her sexuality.  Luke is so drawn to her that he let's his defenses down and allows Kinsey to Dominate him.  Yet, since they both have strong personality both want dominance over each other.  Their relationship turns into a full on web of desire and passion.I give this book 4 stars. It portrays strong, powerful, sexy women like Kinsey and others like her that you meet in this amazing story.  What I loved about this story was that you got to meet other characters like the Dempsey's who are so complex and have a story of their own to tell.~Scar","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W4NYB8WEH6WB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476785902#wasThisHelpful","R1W4NYB8WEH6WB","A20MYFNLY6TGNL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20MYFNLY6TGNL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The safe is definitely worth the money. It is heavy duty and does provide a safe place for documents.  The slot is perfect for my needs.There are three complaints that I see in the write-ups... perhaps I can help.The key only needs to be turned counter clockwise just a little bit, perhaps a 16th of a turn, to unlock the safe.  If you try to turn it with force it will break.The key cover just pops off with just a little bit of force and it easily presses back on.If you have trouble setting the code perhaps a number was pressed prior to setting the code.  Just take out the batteries which resets the code and try again. If you do not the code will not be able to be set.The other comments were that the safe can be opened without keys or combination code.  I don't know if this is true but most leading brand safes for under $200 dollars can be opened easily. You can find out how by searching on Google.  This Safe is a deterrent, thieves will not have a problem. Very secure safes sell for hundreds.

"Update:Installed another screen protector on 2nd Surface RT quickly with no flaws. It is quite easy if you follow the below steps.  View the screen in different light before applying the protector you may see dust that you thought was not there.  I do believe getting the screen slightly moist is a key to easy installation.  The touch feature of the screen does not loose any sensitivity. If you are worried about water intrusion keep the Screen off for 24 hours to ensure it is dry. I have never damaged a tablet.First Review:It is important to have tablet screens gets protection. All of my screens get covered. Look at those that are selling tablets on ebay without screen protectors, most have scratched screens. A larger size screen is harder to cover, however with extreme patience and calmness I  always manage.  The instructions say ""micro"" bubbles will disappear which means very only tiny bubbles. Also if you get water inside the tablet they will not replace your tablet. Tips.Don't rush, set aside at least 20 minutes to complete this task. It may take just a few minutes to install, but rushing is a sure way to failClean the screen perfectly and than install quickly, dust seems to be everywhere and just the smallest bit will cause failure.Wash your hands before applying, avoid fingerprintsExplore how it will fit before applying. There are always sensors that need to be positioned around. So protectors need to be position perfectly. This screen protector has a small amount of give. If it doesn't work at first you can always peel them up and reposition them while wet. Never give up.A very small bubble will disappear if there is no dust underneath it.  Keep working the squeegee.If all else fails screen protectors can be removed rather easilyIf your a perfectionist, you might not want to install a shield. But sooner or later the screen will scratch.I like to moisten the screen just a bit, this makes it much easier to slide the protector around.This Shield was installed perfectly with no bubbles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R229U252RMPTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008D9AIMA#wasThisHelpful","R229U252RMPTP","A1660JZPHFX90N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1660JZPHFX90N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought a used one for 4 dollars, it was quite loud. By the wear of the foam you can tell that it had a lot of pressure applied to the pad especially on the forward part of the pad. After Dis-assembly I found the platen to be broken and one of the forward vibrating post that move the platen was broken.  The motor sounded strong and everything else was surprisingly in great shape especially after someone gave it quite the beating during use.I agree with one feedback. There is only supposed to be a slight  downward pressure put on the pad just to hold it in place as you move it around  letting the vibrations do all the work.I decided since it was such a great deal at $49 with carrying bag I would buy one and use the old one for parts.It would have just cost a little over 24.95 to easily fix the old one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D2LFNCP54JIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009WRKUC#wasThisHelpful","R1D2LFNCP54JIF","A1660JZPHFX90N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1660JZPHFX90N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In my opinion putting this screen on is difficult. It is almost the exact size of the screen so even if you get it just a little bit crooked it will overlap the sides, meaning it will not go on correctly.  And keeping All dust off your screen is difficult.However I did manage to get it on without bubbles.  I think what I learned is it will come off again and again, so lifting it up a bit as shown in the video is a must if you wish to get it perfect. I must have lifted several times to get it perfect.  Do go slowly and do use the tape supplied.The fit was perfect only when it was aligned  perfectly.

"June 1st.You do not need to unlock your phone or use it with AT&T.  Slip in an H20 Sim card, easy to do, and you can have great phone service at half the cost.  This phone is excellent, I can't see needing anything else.  Sound is excellent. And the graphics appear sharp.  When Window Phone Apps get a bit better, I do think you will see more and more people going with windows phones.  I do predict the price of this phone will go up. This is my 3 phone. Bought one just as a backup, for the price this is the best phone out their.  It makes a great tablet even if you do not wish to use the phone.  Runs off of wireless easily.May 9thI  purchased a 32 GB SD card and a  unlocked code for 8 dollars.  This phone is great. It is now loaded  with lots of music and maps etc. I installed a Google Account and Facebook Account so I have all of my old contacts. The screen is great for every day apps. Plugged my USB cable into my Computer and the  transfer of Documents, Music and Pictures was easy.For insurance in case this one breaks I bought another one.  All I need to do if the phone breaks is to swap out the SD Card and Sims Card and it will be ready to go. The paid for apps can be reinstalled. The Windows apps are without a doubt inferior to Google and Apple.  However there are some great apps that will certainly do the job and are daily becoming better.  Of course this is Microsoft's number one mission.  The GPS has a great receiver.  Copilot and Bing Maps are very good Apps.  The Speakers deliver enough sound to be heard well.  It works with Pay Pal here. There is really nothing lacking. When windows gets popular, and it will, you will not get a good deal like this again.My first Review on Getting the PhoneI like the phone. Screen looks good, its fairly fast.  Of course windows does take a little bit of time to learn.  I do not have cellular service where I live but I needed it to swipe credit cards.

"What does a  company mean when it says it will fit most Coleman lanterns!  Normally they list model numbers.  On the double mantle propane lantern it definitely does not fit with or without the bracket.  As many have said if you drill a hole they have gotten it to fit in their lantern.  I did try for about 45 minutes to see if there was a way I could fit it but unless I was willing to try to enlarge the match hole, ""which I wasn't""  it would not fit. Unless it fits perfectly you will have a difficult time twisting the bottom control that lights the mantle.So I think Coleman should start listing model numbers or at least say it may fit you lantern","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MC3PX1088UPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CEMK1K#wasThisHelpful","R1MC3PX1088UPH","A1660JZPHFX90N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1660JZPHFX90N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had used a Sonicare toothbrush for years until it broke. Because of the high price I changed to Oral B.You really can't compare the two since they brush the teeth differently. However I missed the Sonicare because the Oral B just doesn't seem to get my teeth or gum line as clean. Plus my dental checkups were not as good.I finally decided to go back to using Sonicare and as always I did need to make a choice from all the newer models.  The HX6211 is the basic model for all the toothbrushes the rest have features that I really don't need. I disengaged the soft start my holding the power button for a few seconds while in the charger and until I heard the one beep.The tooth brush has as much power as the older models perhaps a bit more.  The one basic principle of this toothbrush is light pressure. The toothbrushes will last a lot longer and the brushing is more effective.My teeth feel clean again along with my gums.

"I must start out by saying I had their Am3s fitness/sleep tracking device and it performed so poorly, I was hoping that something else they made would work better.  Currently, that fitness tracking device is sitting at 2.3 stars after 93 reviews.  Not very good at all.  That product is so bad, they have slashed the price down to $49 AND you can get another 20% off of that.  CAN YOU SAY LIQUIDATING INVENTORY.  Not a good sign Kemosabe,  Unfortunately, this scale is no better in my opinion than the tracking device and is subpar all the way.  Honestly, I think it is the company that is failing.I will give 2 stars for being able to set it up relatively easily and that it actually does display A weight.  Notice how I say, A weight, and not your weight.  I stepped on and off of this thing 5 times and got 5 different results with a spread of 5 pounds.  Huh?Did you know this scale will give you the temperature and humidity reading where it sits on the floor?  Who cares what the temperature is at ground level, not to mention the humidity.  It's not like I sleep on the floor and sit on the floor in my bathroom...for anything.  What an absolute joke that ""feature"" is.  How about you just give me an accurate weight reading and not the time, temp, 7 day forecast or moon phase...my phone does that...I don't need a scale to do that.And then there is the godawful app.  Mind you, iHealth seems to want to confuse the world with 2 versions, that look identical.  Get the version 2, and you will be prompted by your device to update to the regular version as they've discontinued support for this version.  Huh?  In normal terms, isn't the version 2 supposed to be the next gen version?  Whatever.  Not to mention I can't find any of my ""measurements"" anywhere within their app.  I have nothing reporting for weight, nothing for BMI or anything.  Yes it is supposed to sync magically with fairy dust when you connect to wifi and step on the scale.  Your weight is displayed and mystically transported through the cloud via said fairy dust to their magic servers to reside as data forever and ever.  Yet, the app won't pull down my data and has yet to display me a single measurement.Another downside is the size of this unit.  It is GIGANTIC compared to other comparable scales we have...yes, none of those connect to wifi, but they both give me BMI, body fat %, weight etc.  This thing is so big, it's like they shoved the router in each and every unit.Just as their tracker was, I'm afraid I have to report that this scale is a complete waste of money.You know what, after re-reading my own review, I have decided to downgrade from 2 stars to 1.  It is just that bad.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27O5AJI52ST4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2N86JI#wasThisHelpful","R27O5AJI52ST4H","A1OMXVXXP07F05","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OMXVXXP07F05?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've  been shaving about 30 years and have tried a ton of systems from single blad, to 2-5 blades, straight edge razors.  I'm currently using Dollar Shave Club twin razors that cost $3 a month.  So when this came on vine and I see you get 12 razors for about $12...if I could make the razors last, it might be comparable in cost and possibly a step up in the blades.  Boy was I wrong.I use an oil to shave and every razor I've used has glided over my face without leaving a blood trail behind...even my cheapo $3 DSC dual blades have no problems and leave no blood.When I used a fresh blade out of this pack, I ended up cutting myself in 5 spots.  Mind you, I've changed nothing from shaving the day before.  I don't have a heavy beard so I was shocked when this blade left my face a bloody mess.As best as I can tell, these blades seem to clear the water/oil off before the blades are able to hit them.  There is no lube strip, but there is however a big rubber type compound at the wtop of the blades and then also at the bottom.  I think that compound at the bottom of the blade is swiping the oil off my face before the razors get to it so in effect, I'm doing an almost ""dry shave"".Will not use again...","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC527B5O1QQ7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBUYGNA#wasThisHelpful","RC527B5O1QQ7C","A1OMXVXXP07F05","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OMXVXXP07F05?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After not liking their standard product over my current cleaner, when this became available on Vine, I had to try it out.  Here is our situation.  We have a 13 year old Collie.  No matter how often we let her out, she can't make it through the night all the time and will have accidents.  My favorite prior to this has always been Natures Miracle...and I love their lavender scent.This in all ways, meets and or exceeds Natures Miracle in all facets.

"While I was given this blanket for an honest review, this is probably the most versatile ""blanket"" we own...hence the quotes around the word blanket.  First off, this is not a cloth blanket which is a great thing since sand, dirt or even food spillage tends to mess those up quickly.  This is more of a plastic weave product (kind of like that type of lawn/patio furniture) so it allows you easily hose it down, or a quick snap of your wrists to fling the blanket clean!It is also very lightweight...as in it weighs virtually nothing so you can take it to a kids soccer game, football game, picnic, outdoor party, camping, or frankly just about anywhere without a fuss.  The pockets on the side is genius to help hold your needs for the day, whether it be extra water bottles, sunscreen or even just your gadgets and headphones.This is already a staple in the trunk of our car and I would recommend you get as many blankets as you have cars...so you have one for each and it will always be on hand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3857Q4BH01B0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106TBJM2#wasThisHelpful","R3857Q4BH01B0D","A1OMXVXXP07F05","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OMXVXXP07F05?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just finished using this in a section of our house that has a lot of traffic through it (between garage and family room).  I used this in our Bissel ProHeat machine and didn't really notice any difference between this higher priced solution to the various other brands.  This area of our house always leaves the water in the tank after we clean it black and this was no different.  I don't notice anything special with the Oxy clean formula.I could not smell the ""Blue Wave"" scent that is listed on the bottle.  Didn't do much for pet stain/odor.I did like the way the solution didn't foam, even after shaking the bottle as I filled the tank with water.  Other solutions I have used would foam while filling the reservoir tank up making it necessary to stop and wait for the bubbles to go down to keep filling with water.  This solution did not do that which was nice.If you are looking for a solution that will handle pet stains/odors or even if you looking for a more pleasant scent that you will be able to smell, I would recommend Natures Miracle Lavender.

"I definitely liked the idea of having one less gadget on my desk so I thought I'd give this a try and replace my existing modem and router with this all in one solution.Like the others have noted here for Xfinity, although this would connect to the activate section of their website, I was unable to activate this modem online.  Even after waiting the recommended 15 minutes so that all things would be in ""sync"".So I called the Xfinity number (HUGE Kudos to TP LINK for including that phone number in the documentation) and within 5 minutes the modem was up and running...then something weird happened.After I renamed the SSID's and changed the time zone, everything stopped working, even though the modem and router showed all lights/connections were as they should be...I could not reach the internet.  I did reboots, and power downs to no avail.  So I called Xfinity again and sure enough they could see I was having problems, but this time they told me the signal was weak and to check the cable in the back.  Of course, nothing was wrong as I had tightened it as much as possible.After 20 minutes of being on the phone, I defaulted to doing a complete modem reset to factory defaults.  After doing that, it has been working great.Unfortunately, my AIO desktop upstairs now only gets 1 bar signal strength whereas from my previous set up, I was at full bars.  So this doesn't appear to have the range that my other setup had.Also, TPLINK needs an IOS App to control this device.  Having to login to it from the web is old school.  Their ""tether"" app indicates this not yet a supported device...although the Archer C7 is...Another frustrating note is that most of my previous routers had the inlaid option to check for firmware updates within the device settings...not yet on this one.Although it works, and is a little light on the range compared to my old setup, I'm leaving it hooked up for now.  The last thing I want to do is call Xfinity again and go through the activation of my old modem (yes, they actually have to re-load a previous device that was being used).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9CILJMXZSFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012I96J3W#wasThisHelpful","R1O9CILJMXZSFQ","A1OMXVXXP07F05","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OMXVXXP07F05?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have installed my fair share of similar cameras/systems.  Dropcam, and the others worked with no problems.  They all had similar if not identical procedures:  Turn on device, download app, connect to the devices wifi, then the device and your router talk...and viola, its connected and you are good to go.Not with Guardzilla.  Not only has thing failed to connect, half of the times it wouldnt even list my network to connect to.  My neighbors were there, but mine weren't.  Of course I get out of the app, and my iPhone promptly connects to my network.It really seems like a hit or miss with this device.  I know what I'm doing on my end is right.I'm wondering if it has something to do with dual-band routers as this device will only see my 2.4ghz band...could be.

I have to say, in the end, the video quality is subpar...even on the highest setting.  The motion detection system is spotty...even after changing settings.  The pet setting doesn't work for me.  The images it catches when armed wouldn't let you finger a criminal in a court room if needed.

"Of all of the fitness trackers I have owned and currently own, this is the worst of the lot.  For a little background here is what I've used so far:  Fitbit, Withings, Misfit, Basis, Tushi Fitness, Moov, Pebble and even a no-name device, this iHealth is utterly useless.Amazingly, this device arrives in a very nice, sleek package which makes you think it is going to be nice.  Reality soon sets in however as you pull out the miniature instruction booklet that is about 40 pages thick and out of all of that, you get 4 pages of colorful icons telling you how to set it up.  It goes something like this:  Get Charged, Get the App, Get Connected, Displays, Mode and Personalize.  I've still yet to see the sleep mode screen, workout screen and airplane mode screen...I have no idea how to get to those because nothing tells you!Step tracking is a joke.  I got up this morning to write this review and walked about 45 steps to get some coffee and sit at the computer.  I'm up to 191 steps already.  I've walked 1/10th of a mile and have burned 715 calories already.  I mean, this is so bad, it should be recalled.The only positive experience I've had is the device had no problem connecting to the app on my iPhone 5S.  However, the app itself is useless as even when it syncs, the dashboard layout reads no data for sleep, activity etc...when clearly there is some.  Only when you maximize each section do you see any type of chart of your data.This has the silent alarm, which worked great for waking me up, but the ""get up and move"" alarm that went off during the night on several occasions almost had me throwing this against the wall.  My settings clearly tell the device to only track between certain times, and yet it was telling me at 11pm that I had been idle for too long.  Yah, duh.  I'm trying to sleep.I'm pretty sure firmware updates can't save this product from imploding in the already crowded fitness/activity tracker market.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FHFS0AL46Q39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPUEWD2#wasThisHelpful","R1FHFS0AL46Q39","A1OMXVXXP07F05","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OMXVXXP07F05?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thought I was going insane...until I realized it was Listerine who is not taking my health seriously.  Horrific company.I decided to use this product because I hate the horrific feeling of my mouth burning from the alcohol-based version of this product.  Not to mention, there may be a slight risk of increased oral cancer (after a long period of use) from any alcohol based rinses due to the intrinsic inflammation such rinses cause inside the mouth.And so, every morning and night, exactly as per the label's instructions Of Listerine Zero, I would rinse my mouth with this product.I noticed that after I'd wake up every morning, the inside of my mouth (mainly the gums and cheeks) would slough off (shed) massive amounts of dead tissue.  It was disgusting to say the least and highly alarming as well.  Others online have called this shedding ""white slime"", but having a medical background I know it's dead and decaying mucous membranes (the lining of the inside of your mouth).  On top of that, I experience redness, significant pain, and ulceration inside the mouth.At first, I wasn't sure this was due to the Listerine.  I thought I may be having a reaction to another product.  Maybe it was the new toothpaste.  Maybe it was some sort of food.  After carefully whittling away the other possibilities, I was 100% sure it was due to the Listerine Zero.To make sure I wasn't the only one and that this wasn't some isolated incident, I did an online search and notice MASSIVE amounts of people reporting the same problem, including on Listerine's own website!Listerine KNOWS this is NOT an uncommon reaction to their product despite saying on their website when someone complains: ""This is not a reaction we'd expect while using this product"" on their own website, however their OWN WEBSITE has a ton of the same complaints as do other websites online.  You can google ""listerine zero"" and see similar reviews on their website.Since Listerine, being such a ""caring company"", didn't mention the possibility or warning of this horrific reaction anywhere on their product as a good company would, nor why it was occurring to me,  I decided to research it for myself.The answer for most people?  Most likely it is a reaction to an ingredient called sodium lauryl sulfate.  What is it?  A DETERGENT used in cleaning products known to science and medicine to cause taste alteration, irritation, and ulceration in people.  You know what else?  SLS has been shown to actually DECREASE the effectiveness of fluoride at preventing tooth decay.  The same fluoride found in your toothpaste and in Listerine's product.Yep, good old Listerine put in a known, irritating, detergent inside of its product that causes the tissues inside of your mouth to die.  And it put in the same ingredient to counteract the effects of its fluoride ingredient.  Commece slow, sarcastic, clap in Listerine's direction and probably a class action lawsuit in the future.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R136AV9UXHITP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054J2GDQ#wasThisHelpful","R136AV9UXHITP4","A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have very similar (in principal function) headphones but without a doubt these work way better at cancelling noise and letting in the human voice.

"Wow!  Having just returned two sleeping bags for various reasons, this was like a light at the end of a tunnel!My prior issues with sleeping bags have mainly been:  improper temperature ratings (cold to sleep in even though the weather is in their supposed comfort range), horrific zippers that make it impossible to zip yourself up, large size (weight and/or compressibility of the bag).Suffice it to say, this bag swats away the competition I've dealt with so far.  For a bag rated, temperature-wise, relatively this low, it is very small and easily fits into any straps on a 40-60L bag I'm aware of.  It's feather light, no pun in tended.  I meant this thing is really, truly very light and does wonders for those hiking for days on end like myself.  Finally, the zipper is seamless.  Nothing gets stuck, it's easy to maneuver from inside the bag too.  The bag is also very comfortable to sleep in.Kudos to the company for making serious note of temperature differences between men and women.  Women do tend to sleep colder than men as I have found out on more than one occasion.  This bag is thus rated a comfort 32F for women and 21F for men.I have already tested it in 30F weather with two layers of dry clothing, no wind, in a one man tent, with no additional liner, and slept very warmly.Easy to roll back up into the sac when you're done too.  Brownie points for that as many bags are not so easily fit back in.Overall, this is a superb sleeping bag and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22XZEQLVLWW49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCFAYQ#wasThisHelpful","R22XZEQLVLWW49","A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Look, for the price of the tent, currently $75, you're probably not going to get something better.I returned mine, but not because of the price.  It's because this is meant for very light camping.  Very soft, even ground.  If you're going to be camping anywhere that doesn't fit this description, it's not really for you.PROS:1.  Very light for a tent this size.  One of the lightest out there2.  Easy to learn how to set-up3.  Roomy for one person and a full 60L bag.  You can, if you squeeze in, fit two people inside in sleeping bags (with no extra gear though)4.  Very warm.  I mean, this thing really help keep the heat in on a cold night, much better than other tents I've had.CONS:1.  Very hard to get in/out of.  You have to crawl into a tunnel basically2.  Not for the claustrophobic as the tent doesn't sit far above your head3.  The stakes and rods are of poor quality design and can bend/snap easily4.  May rip easily in rocky terrain or if you're not carefuly placing gear inside there.

"Update:  I have long hair.  The frame of these glasses constantly catches on my hair and tries to rip it out.  So if you have long hair don't buy these, otherwise, read below:I'm very happy with these sunglasses and what you get for $20 is truly incredible.Firstly, these fit very comfortably on my face (average sized male face/nose).  They look super stylish, like $100 Oakleys.  The case itself is worth $15 alone as it can not only fit the sunglasses, but all the other lenses, as well as all the accessories in a very secure package that isn't overly big!The sunglasses not only fit comfortably but really do a great job blocking out the light as they wrap around the sides of my eyes.  The interchangeable lenses are really easily snapped in/out.  However, you should disregard the package instructions on how to remove them or else you'll have great difficulty.  Start by pulling on the  middle section first when detaching the lens and pushing up on the middle section first when replacing with the new lens.I only take 1 star off because only 1 of the lenses (the black lens that's not attached originally) is polarized.  I personally don't like non-polarized lenses.Otherwise, for $20 I'm very happy that I can simply buy replacement lenses from now on as I see fit (when they inevitably get scratched).  It'll save me even more money in the long run!  And the great variety of lenses for different conditions is truly astonishing, anything you can imagine: snow, rain, night, cloudy, sun, etc...","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ARWWZDNXNS89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JB3DU4A#wasThisHelpful","R3ARWWZDNXNS89","A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, everything about this kettle is superb in terms of quality, looks, and speed of boiling water.  But, as with every other electric kettle I've come across it is for some absolutely unknown reason full of plastic inside.

What do you do with the plastic base where the filter goes solidly attached to the kettle?  Break it off?  I'm not willing to risk it.  You may remove the plastic filter but not the base so it's no good.If leeching plastic isn't a big concern for you with respect to the tea kettles this is a great electric kettle, though.

With that in mind:Sound:  The resonance is ok, not that great but not that bad either.Build:  Overall built well.  The only problem is the action is a bit on the low side.  This is good for barre chords but bad because you inevitably get undue vibration in the top strings, mainly.  The neck is wide.  This is bad for any of you with short fingers.  It's quite a bit wider than a steel string, great for picking individual strings, bad for short fingers.Strings:  Average nylon.  Nothing fancy.

"Well, first things first.  I got a professional to install this because by no means do I have the skills to do it and the documentation itself mentioned the need for this if I remember correctly.From the get-go, if you have gas going to your house, I can tell you that most likely using a gas heater is more economical than an electric one, including this one.But having no other choice, this so far seems more economical for a house of 2 people, 2 bathrooms, a dishwasher/washing machine, and a constant cook.Based on our average daily usage, we'll be saving money with this unit and so far we've always had enough hot water for our daily needs (even when both showers are on).However, it will take a long time for us to recoup the cost of installing this unit.  So long as it lasts a very long time without fail, we will.Overall, it works well for a medium sized home with two people (maybe one guest) when multiple hot water sources are running and it is economical (compared to our previous heater).

Those bands are great, provide a lot of length, and are great for your feet.However, this band, when it comes to your hands/chest, is far more convenient and quicker to use than having to set the bands up individually.Here, the principle is you grip at the edges for minimum resistance upon stretch and grab closer to the center for maximum resistance.Therefore, this thing provides a very wide range of resistance, mimicking the individual bands, but all in one compact and easy to use band (no assembly/dissasembly of other stuff)There is one downside:  hair/crumbs and other stuff on the floor stick to this thing really easily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AFF6KR0NGB9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBEW05Q#wasThisHelpful","R3AFF6KR0NGB9N","A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This coffeemaker is really stylish in person, more so than in the pictures, and will fit into any modern kitchen design.The on-screen display and menus/buttons are very easy and intuitive to navigate to choose a HUGE amount of settings (timers, how to grind the beans, etc...).And, as you'd expect from any modern coffeemaker, there is no need to buy disposable filters, which is a big plus for me (although I know not all people like this).Most importantly for me: it makes great coffee and is very easy to clean.In short, I could not have asked for a better coffee maker.Since I use it every single morning, I'll post back here in a few months to ensure that it actually lasts, since we all know that even the great machines can go a bit haywire quickly.

"I've never owned a George Foreman grill, although I did buy an imitation one many years ago I was quite unhappy with.For two people, this grill is just right.  However, I should add that if you're going to be cooking a lot for 4 or more people, you'll definitely have to use this thing more than once.  Don't think you'll be able to grill four big pieces of steak on this thing.Nevertheless, it cooks food quickly enough, isn't messy like the imitation one I bought, and is very easy to clean so long as you do it when it's warm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO69Y3BUXSJYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP3ZPVK#wasThisHelpful","RO69Y3BUXSJYZ","A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great printer for anyone looking for an all-in-one for school or basic home office type stuff.  There's nothing fancy about it, for today's age it's pretty bare bones but the price for all of the features is right where it should be.* This thing prints very quickly (I use the draft version to use less ink and it spits out the page in less than a couple seconds with pretty good resolution nonetheless).  Auto-double sided printing is very fast and importantly doesn't tilt.  Some printers, when they flip the page automatically, will for some reason tilt the text of the page relative to the page itself, making the margins completely skewed.  This hasn't happened yet with this printer.* Has a very basic but still intuitive touchpad.  I honestly don't use it much and control most everything from the computer.* Receives and send faxes without a problem.* Scans ok.  The scan quality is great, no doubt, but it's not the fastest scanner by any means and will take you a good solid 2-3 minutes for something like 1200 dpi (from start to finish, including saving the file).* Has not jammed yet!  I've had more than one Epson before and can attest that after many years they very very rarely jam!* Wi-Fi is ok.  I say ok because for some reason it glitches every now and then maybe once every twenty prints or so).  What happens is, I'll push print via wi-fi from a PC or mobile device and it will either not print the entire document or will print very very slowly, as if the signal is not getting through.  I tried adjusting soft and hard firewall setting but nothing seemed to help.  This is by far my biggest gripe with the printer so far...I'm still trying to find a solution.Overall though, this is a good little printer for most home/school office type situations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OA9JR40Y1WDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV8QBG2#wasThisHelpful","R3OA9JR40Y1WDR","A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE this toaster oven.  I live in an apartment where it's just plain silly to heat up a huge stove to make a small pizza or some little snacks for myself.  This consumes WAY less energy (and my bill went down a bit as a result) and is very easy and quick to use (something in the middle of a microwave and stove).First of all, it gets to the right temperature pretty quickly, faster than the oven (makes sense since it's so much smaller).Second of all, it cooks thoroughly and evenly.  My oven for some reason leaves the center far less cooked than the edges of whatever I put in it.Thirdly, it's been easy to clean to so far with a simple wet towel/rag.Overall, this is perfect for you if you want a really handy little toaster over for yourself or to quickly heat up/reheat things if you're not a big fan of the stuff microwaves do to your food.

"Bought this because the ""New Roku Lost Replacement Remote Control"" I had bought last week didn't work right out of the box, and I didn't want to take another chance on one of those. This RCA unit is $5 cheaper and seems much sturdier, plus it will control the TV as well as the Roku. I've read some of the negative reviews for this item and, frankly, I can't understand some of them. The RCA was very easy to program. It took me a total of 10-15 minutes to digest the relevant part of the instructions and to program the unit to control both the TV and the Roku. It is true that the instruction sheet goes on-and-on, but if you have ever programmed a remote control unit before you sort of know the basics and you can skip to the parts that are relevant for you. Not a big deal, actually. One person wrote that there is no button to control the source code. That is not true. There is an input button right under the number ""9"" button. I tried it and it works perfectly. As this is not specifically made just for ""Roku"", you do have to play around a little bit to find the buttons that will do the same things a ""Roku"" remote will do. For example, the little ""up arrow"" above the OK performs the same ""back"" function as the ""left arrow"" on the ""Roku"" remote. The red button above the ""up arrow"" performs the same function as the ""home button"" that is at the top right of a ""Roku"" remote. Takes a little getting used to, but again no big deal. All-in-all, I am very happy with this RCA unit. It works beautifully and is great value for the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WYMTP8WA9O9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BYVHED0#wasThisHelpful","R1WYMTP8WA9O9W","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This didn't work, right out of the box. (Well, I did put the batteries in first!) We have a Roku 2 and a Roku 3 and it wouldn't work with either one. I did notice this had a lot of good reviews, but also a few bad ones where people experienced the same problem that I had. I guess it is the luck of the draw? It is very cheap looking and feeling, and it doesn't have the little Roku tab and it doesn't say ""Roku"" in the battery compartment, so I'm wondering if this is some kind of a knockoff that fell off the back of a truck! Anyway, fool me once, shame on you...so I wasn't going to go for twice. I did a little research and found out that there are universal remotes that will work Roku units. I opted for the RCA RCR314WR 3-Device Big Button Dual Navigation Remote. We are very happy with that. (Please cross-refer to my review of that item.)

"This book tackles a subject that is usually only briefly mentioned in biographies of George Washington and histories of The American Revolution. I was interested in a more in-depth analysis of the topic, and that is what ""Swords In Their Hands"" delivers. My 4 star rating is meant to ""straddle the fence"", as I think if you are mostly interested in a scholarly study, you would most likely find this a 4.5 star book. If you are more interested in a popular history you might only give it 3.5 stars. The first half of the book goes into great detail concerning the financing (or lack thereof) of the revolution. This provides the foundation so that we can understand why the officers took the radical step of fomenting The Newburgh Conspiracy. Their grievances were longstanding and were not being addressed at any level of government. As another reviewer has mentioned, this section of the book could have been much shorter with no damage done to what Mr. Richards was trying to get across to the reader. The second half of the book deals more with the events leading up to the conspiracy and the meeting attended by General Washington where he managed, by both logical and emotional arguments, to effectively put an end to the conspiracy. The author is especially convincing when he argues that Washington's speech to the assembled officers was a carefully worked out ""performance"", steeped in classical references that would be understood by educated men, as well as an emotional appeal that relied on the good will that Washington himself had built up after years of personal sacrifice and loyalty to his men. The book has some brief biographical studies of the key players in the saga, as well as some very nice illustrations. The only reader who would be  disappointed in this book, to my way of thinking, is the reader who is looking for an ""action packed"" adventure story, with lots of derring-do. This is not that kind of a book. Other than that caveat, I think the book is well-written and adds something new to the vast body of work on Washington and The American Revolution, and is definitely worth your time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IJDJB8XC8PCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985387580#wasThisHelpful","R3IJDJB8XC8PCZ","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got tired of having to always pull down my ""beanie"" over my ears to keep them warm, and I don't like wearing a scarf when I have to shovel snow...so I sprung for one of these, and I am really pleased. It fits well and I love the fact that the material extends all the way down and does a great job of covering my neck. I tested this out shoveling snow on a day where it was 2 degrees. Granted, it was sunny and it wasn't windy...but 2 degrees is 2 degrees! I felt like I was sitting in the house in front of the fireplace. My face, head, ears and neck all felt toasty. Love the color, too, as it goes well with my L.L.Bean jacket. Granted, I can't wear my glasses with this, but my vision is good enough that I can shovel my walkway and driveway without putting myself in any danger! One thing people might like to know is that it has to be REALLY cold if you are going to wear this. If the temperature is above 20 degrees and you are going to be shoveling for any length of time your head is going to get sweaty. But in that situation, just elect to wear something different. For the really nasty days, it's nice to have this baby in your arsenal !","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QC2CEM6K9C8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AF0SOOO#wasThisHelpful","R2QC2CEM6K9C8C","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Berry, berry? Quite the contrary! This doesn't smell like blackberries and it doesn't smell like pears. I've been using this for a week now and I'm still trying to figure out the scent. I guess you could say it smells sort of spicy, with a bit of a mineral smell thrown in. (Must be those Dead Sea minerals!) The smell is okay. Not unpleasant at all, just not what I was expecting. From a functional standpoint, it's a nice bar of soap. It lathers up nicely and feels great on my skin. It's a big bar and so far it looks like it will last a good long while....maybe 3-4 weeks. But there are a lot of good soaps out there, and I bought this because I was looking for a nice blackberry-pear smell. I assume anybody else who looks at this webpage is looking for the same thing. That's why I'm giving this 3 stars even though the quality of the soap itself is good.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RYFKSP3N4S2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008N1SJQA#wasThisHelpful","R2RYFKSP3N4S2R","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I have had the Echo for just over a week, and we love it. We use it almost exclusively to play music. It is also useful for getting the current temperature and a quick weather forecast. Alexa always wakes up when we say her name and she almost always understands our requests and responds immediately. Once in awhile she will not hear us correctly and we will have to state the request again or re-phrase it in such a way that it makes sense to her. You have to experiment and see what works best. For example, sometimes if you ask for music from an artist you will get something different if you ask for ""music from prime"" rather than just making a ""blanket"" request (which you might assume would give you everything by that artist). If you ask for something that you don't own and is not in prime, she will play a sample. One time she asked if we wanted to buy the song (which we did), and she confirmed the request before going ahead with the purchase. (But she doesn't always ask if you want to buy a song, which I guess is a glitch. Haven't tried it yet since it's only been a week, but I imagine if you ask her outright without being prompted she will buy the song for you anyway.) You can ask Alexa to lower or raise volume and you can also ask her to pause playing music and then to resume. Amazon programmers had some fun with Echo. If you thank Alexa, she will say ""no problem"" or ""you're welcome"". If you say goodnight, Alexa will reply ""goodnight"" or ""sleep tight"" or ""don't let the bedbugs bite"". Kids and ""kids at heart"" (like my wife and I), will enjoy this feature. As other reviewers have mentioned, I am curious to see what features Amazon adds once they and we have some experience with the Echo. Not because I want or need more. I am just curious! I went into this expecting a cool new device that plays music with a voice request, and I liked theidea that Alexa can talk. I am not an ""audio freak"" and am not an electronics expert, but within the limits of playing music via a short cylinder I am quite happy with the sound quality of the Echo. To sum up, I think if you are mainly looking for a fun device to play your music ""at the drop of a hat"", without you having the bother of doing the legwork to find the song or album, the Echo is for you. If you want a lot more than that, you may be disappointed....at least at this point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NF6VMX3QTMR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9EPT8O#wasThisHelpful","R3NF6VMX3QTMR0","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice orange smell. Felt like I was squeezing fresh oranges over myself! Made the bathroom, and me, smell really nice, too. The bar is small enough that it is easy to handle. (I also like Mistral's and Pre de Provence, but they are a bit bulky the first week or so until you whittle them ""down to size""!) The soap is not harsh and feels nice on my skin. Lathers up nicely. One bar lasts one person two weeks. You get ""more bang for the buck"" with the brands I mentioned above as they last just about a month. But after a couple of weeks I am ready for a change so I didn't mind the ""Santa Monica"" not lasting as long.

"This is an amazingly good book for anyone to have written, let alone a first time author. It is tremendously inventive and wickedly funny, with wonderful dialogue and interesting characters. One thing I loved about the book, oddly enough, is that it is all over the place. There are political references that might be obscure to a twentysomething (Cambodia/Pol Pot) as well as numerous popular culture references (movies by Mel Brooks;Francis Ford Coppola;Steven Spielberg, etc.). Do you enjoy yin-yang juxtaposition? Check out this bit: ""A Rastafarian singing the Cornell alma mater song in a perfect baritone devoid of 'ja mon' syntax was a clear runner up for cognitive dissonance of the year. Right after a tea bagger on Medicare protesting too much government in his life."" Either you love that sort of stuff or you don't! How best to describe this book? It's a combination of Joseph Heller meets John Carpenter meets The Marx Brothers, by way of Jimmy Buffett and Bob Marley. I think that about covers it. Alternate title for this review: ""A Farewell To Arms - World War Z Edition"". Another great thing about this book is it won't cost you an arm and a leg. Sorry. Couldn't resist.

I found it to be an unexpected jewel of a read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AMG9WZCFZ1FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVUW06W#wasThisHelpful","R1AMG9WZCFZ1FM","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Obviously, this is not a book that the pope is going to be reading. But if you are more catholic in your tastes, this novel is a hoot. I was a bit hesitant before starting this, because ""broad humor"" books can sometimes get a bit TOO ridiculous. But this one holds together nicely. The characters are well-crafted, and the dialogue is very funny. The plot is interesting and exciting and....I know this sounds like a cliche....you can't wait to find out what is going to happen next. With most books I read I put in my 30-40 pages a night and I'm content to put the book down. With this one I couldn't wait to get to the next chapter. The author has a great imagination, and it is interesting to learn exactly what is ""The Word According To Whitehead"". Just to whet your appetite, here is some of what you will find in ""The Reluctant Jesus"": a talking cat; a talking cockroach; a miracle performed in Central Park involving  fast-food and a troop of Boy Scouts from out of town; an anti-Christ who looks like Woody Allen; a jive-talkin' gangsta doorman who is much more than what he seems; and a jealous Jesus. Oh, and Mr. Whitehead also gives us a glimpse of heaven and who resides there. He also explains what God and Satan are up to when they are not available to answer our prayers. What more could you want? If you don't take your religion too seriously, please give this book a try. It's a wild ride and a fun read. By the way, I think it would also make a great movie. Is anyone from Hollywood paying attention?","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E2GLIKUHHYCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1457527049#wasThisHelpful","R1E2GLIKUHHYCL","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before writing this I read the 7 reviews that were posted (so far). I won't go into the ""workings"" of the machine as Nespresso and the other reviewers have pretty much told you what you need to know. Let me just add my 2 cents as to why I really like the Nespresso VertuoLine.I had been using a Nespresso Citiz machine for the past 3 years. Absolutely loved it and had no problems. However, I kept wishing for a machine that could also make excellent coffee. Saw the Nespresso VertuoLine  on the cover of a Williams-Sonoma catalog last week. Read up on it, it sounded great, and I ordered it. It arrived a few days ago. Before setting up the machine I read the reviews on Amazon. 2 were posted at that time. 1 was a 5 star but the other was a 2 star. The unfavorable review mentioned that the coffee was weak and lukewarm, and that concerned me. So after setting up the machine I tried the decaf pod. (I don't drink decaf and I didn't want to waste a regular pod since this was an ""experiment""!) Sure enough, the coffee came out lukewarm. I called up customer service technical support and got a super-friendly and helpful person named Jennie. She asked me to try a different pod as the machine adjusts the brewing temperature based on the blend. (She stayed on the line while I went thru the brewing process again.) I made a ""Stormio"" and that came out nice and hot and strong with a thick crema. Delicious! Jennie wasn't aware of any problems with brewing temperatures and she isn't a decaf drinker but she told me she was going to look into this to see if there is a problem with the brewing temperature for the decaf. She asked me if I was happy with the machine and I told her since I am not a decaf drinker I didn't have an issue as long as all the other blends brewed okay. She actually gave me her phone extension and asked me to call her back if I ran into any further problems and wasn't happy with the machine. She also took the time to register the machine for me.It is now a couple of days later and I have made 2 other blends. Both came out very hot, they tasted great (I like strong coffee) and the crema was nice and thick. I have not run into any snags since that first try with the decaf. There are 8 types of blends for the regular coffee, which I think is plenty. Not counting the decaf, there are only 3 espresso blends, which I can see might be an issue for folks who are used to a larger selection with previous Nespresso machines. Personally,  the choice of only 3 is not a problem. They offer a number 4, a 9, and an 11. 11 is too strong for me and 4 is too weak but the 9 is perfect. In any case, I assume at some point they will increase the number of selections once the machine has been on the market for awhile.As far as the cost issue, some quick math tells me these pods cost about 85 cents each compared to 65 cents for the Nespresso Citiz capsules. Since the machine allows you to make larger cups of coffee/espresso the capsules contain more coffee. I only drink 1 cup of coffee a day, so I figure the pods will cost me about $6 more per month compared to the Citiz capsules. Considering the high quality of the coffee, I don't have a problem with that. If you are drinking 3-4 cups a day I can see where this might become an issue for you, though.To summarize, this machine makes great tasting and hot coffee and espresso, with thick crema. It's a beautiful looking machine, it's quiet, and it is only slightly larger than my Nespresso Citiz. (It's about the same length, and maybe 4 inches wider.) The only reason I am giving a rating of 4 stars rather than 5 is because of what happened with that first decaf pod. I'm guessing that the machine brews the decaf at a lower temperature but it should be hotter than lukewarm. Don't know if there's a glitch with how the machine reads the decaf barcode or if my machine just wasn't properly ""primed"" since that was the very first cup of coffee it was making. If you are a regular or occasional decaf drinker, as a precaution you might want to call Nespresso customer service and talk to the technical support people before purchasing the machine, just to see if there is an issue. Other than that, I give the VertuolLine a big thumbs up.Update 3/12/14.....Was finishing up the sampler pack that came with the machine, so I made the half-decaf/half-regular pod. (I wouldn't usually drink this since it is part- decaf, but it IS half-regular so why waste it?!) Had the same problem as I had with the full-decaf pod on the first day I used the machine. The brew came out just a notch above lukewarm. Definitely not on the hot side. So it does seem there is a problem with the brewing temperature the machine is set for when there is decaf involved. It doesn't change my 4 star rating since I don't drink decaf, anyway,and all the non-decaf blends came out nice and hot, but you low octane folks should be aware of this problem!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S9ZXJ8YCX9OS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILLV2U2#wasThisHelpful","R1S9ZXJ8YCX9OS","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How to describe this book? A wild, rollercoaster ride through place and time, with dashes of history, both political and religious, philosophy, mysticism, etc. At one point in the book the author mentions the novel ""Catch-22"" by Joseph Heller. I suspect it's one of his favorite books and you can see its influence in his writing. The plots are totally unrelated but, like Heller, Mr. MacGregor uses vast quantities of humor and absurd situations to explore very serious issues. Maybe 2 or 3 times a year I will read a book where I get about halfway through and find I can't put it down. I've got to know what happens and I don't want to wait. This book was like that for me. The plotting is intricate and clever and exciting. I also liked all the moving around from place to place. How often do you see a book that moves from rural Australia to Westminster Abbey to the hills of Haiti? How often do you have characters as varied as Aborigines, middle-class students, bums, clerics and ""witch doctors""? It doesn't hurt that Mr. MacGregor writes beautifully of people and places and there is a lot of snappy dialogue. This is very impressive stuff from a first-time author. The only thing that marred the book a bit was that in the transition to e-book a few spelling errors crept in, which sort of pulled me out of the book and back to reality from time to time. But that's really a minor criticism and doesn't change the fact that this was an impressive and enjoyable reading experience. 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18Y44DAC7RLRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPAEUQI#wasThisHelpful","R18Y44DAC7RLRM","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an impressive book, especially for a first-time author. It gives a comprehensive look at what a golfer has to go through to try to make it at the highest level. The author covers: the expense involved in going to the qualifier and pre-qualifier events;the small or non-existent payouts; the varying conditions of golf courses that are not always top-notch; working with swing-coaches, putting gurus and sports psychologists; advances in technology and being properly fitted for clubs (which allowed Keith to hit the ball further at age 50 than he could as a scratch golfer at age 16); the importance of a good ""looper""; fraud on one of the mini-tours; playing with golfers who cheat (in the author's experience, these tend to be the better golfers rather than Joe Ordinary!); etc. The book flows along smoothly and Keith has a nice writing style (except for an unfortunate penchant for using the word ""couple"" on almost every page! How about ""several"" or ""a few"" once in awhile?) The only reason I am giving this book 4 stars rather than 5 is because the author tends to go into too much shot-by-shot detail of too many rounds. Even for a golf-nut such as myself it got to be a bit too much at times. It might have been better if some of these rounds had been eliminated, even if the book would have been a bit shorter. Or maybe Keith could have included a few more anecdotes about his fellow players? Still, these are minor quibbles and this is a very good book and it gives a wonderful behind-the-scenes look at the real world of the journeyman golfer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20Z1D2Q7PHPOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983873704#wasThisHelpful","R20Z1D2Q7PHPOC","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first bought this item sometime in 2011. It worked well for about 9 months and then it just died. I bought a 2nd one in August 2012 and in February or March 2013 it started acting strangely....i.e....I would recharge it and then a few days later it would lose the charge. It went on like that for about a month...sometimes holding the charge for a full 2 weeks and sometimes holding the charge for just a few days. This past week it started doing something different. It would be fully charged but when I'd push the ""spray"" button it would only work once or twice and then the green light would go off. If I turned it on again it would work for a few seconds and then stop again. And so on......With the first unit I figured I just got a bad unit. But now that this has happened a 2nd time I feel it must be a basic problem with this flosser. While it worked I had no complaints with the effectiveness or ease of use. But I won't buy this item again due to the problem with the battery. Just a few hours ago I looked around on Amazon and decided to go with the Waterpik Spray Flosser as it had no bad reviews. I think it is a plug-in unit and it looks a bit clunkier, but I notice that it comes with 6 tips and has 10 power settings so you can adjust the force of the spray.

"Interesting little book which explains the difference between fables and proverbs, and then goes on to explain how some of Aesop's proverbs had their basis in fables while others did not. The author goes on to show us that some of the proverbs were not written by Aesop, but were written by later authors merely ""in the style of"" Aesop. Some were Greek but others were Roman in origin. This brief beginning section of the book leads us into the proverbs themselves, and we are shown some of the fables the proverbs were (or may have been) based on. We are also given some proverbs by later writers that are in a similar, or opposite, vein. I don't read Greek or Latin and so cannot attest to the accuracy of the author's translations, but the translations flow and read smoothly. It is interesting, but not surprising, that some of the proverbs make perfect sense today while others make you scratch your head. Sometimes the proverbs lack the clarity and wit of the fables, and seem a bit obscure, so it is a bonus and pleasure to have the fables included. Both proverbs and fables are a nice reminder that human nature, despite differences in culture and the passage of more than 2,000 years, is a comforting (or is that disappointing?) constant. So even though ""It's"" Greek and Latin, it mostly makes perfect sense to me!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O2XF8M4UVTSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589826922#wasThisHelpful","R2O2XF8M4UVTSS","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was very impressed with this pan. I have used so-called non-stick pans in the past and have always found them a bit wanting. This pan, however, did live up to all the positive reviews that were already posted on Amazon. I read the pre-use instructions and washed the pan in soap and water and then I rubbed on a little olive oil for ""seasoning."" I then made an omelette over medium heat, as the instructions state that the pan is an excellent conductor of heat and they suggest not using high heat. About halfway thru the cooking process I added a slice of cheese to the mix. The omelette was done perfectly and in a short period of time. It slid out of the pan and onto the plate with absolutely no sticking. Even the little bit of cheese that had dripped into the pan didn't stick. (By the way, other than seasoning the pan I added absolutely no other oil or butter to the pan.) The pan has a nice, long handle that is comfortable and doesn't get hot. In conclusion, the pan heats quickly and evenly, it is truly non-stick, and cleans up like a dream.

"I was a little disappointed in this book. To be honest, it was not very well-written. Many sentences were awkwardly worded and sometimes too prolix. The extensive use of military acronyms and the explanations of what they meant frequently interrupted the flow of the book. The authors had fairly run-of-the-mill jobs while stationed in Germany and Vietnam, so the descriptions of what they did in the various duty stations were not all that interesting. Actually, while you might expect that the sections on West Berlin during the Cold War and Vietnam during the Vietnam War would be the most interesting, the section on jungle training in Panama was the most informative. However, that was a very brief section. I was hoping for some biographical information about the authors which might help the reader get into their heads, but this was lacking as well. Mr. Geschke tells a tiny bit about his post-military life at the end of the book, but we learn nothing at all about Mr. Toto. And, in what was a really puzzling section, Mr. Toto intimates that he could have talked about many other things but chose not to because the topics were too painful. I am giving the book a tentative thumbs-up because, having never served in the military, I did learn a bit about the training the men had to go through, and a lot of this information was presented in an entertaining and self-deprecating manner.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JMWTW9W6S3LL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=146202355X#wasThisHelpful","R3JMWTW9W6S3LL","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maria Sutton has written a fascinating, moving memoir of her virtually lifelong search to find out not only what happened to her father, but also to learn what kind of man he was. Along the way she also manages to locate the brother her mother hasn't seen for over 40 years. (She enlists the help of a former KGB agent to accomplish this!) Finally, she is also able to discover the identity of her mother's father. The amount of research and detective work that Maria does is incredible. Some people might look at it as obsessive, but I found it admirable. As she states near the end of the book, each of us must decide what gives life meaning. In her case, she needed to find out about the man who was responsible for her being born. And she needed to reconnect with her European roots. The book is bittersweet, as Maria finds out some extremely unpleasant things about her father which shatter her idealized vision of him. But the self-knowledge she gains and the ""new"" family she discovers compensate for her disappointment. The book is wonderfully written and I found it difficult to believe that this is the author's first work. I am not easily moved, but at several points this book brought me to tears. Impressive and highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12I82SUXY9EZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1555664466#wasThisHelpful","R12I82SUXY9EZS","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very disappointed in this soap. Having tried and liked ""Suave"" coconut bodywash and ""Organix"" coconut milk shampoo (both products having a wonderful coconut smell), I was amazed that this new bar soap by ""Softsoap"" has absolutely no coconut smell. Zero! Why they put coconut in the title, I have no idea. Actually, whatever scent this soap has is a bit unpleasant. It has got a vague, chemical smell to it. So, if you are a fellow coconut lover I would advise you to stay away from this and look elsewhere.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HAEQITEZ6A2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005K144AQ#wasThisHelpful","R1HAEQITEZ6A2Z","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent book concerning the relationship of Theodore Roosevelt and the Maine hunting and fishing guide Bill Sewall. Roosevelt first met Sewall when Roosevelt was still a student at Harvard in the late 1870's. We tend to remember Teddy as the stout and robust fellow he became in later years, but as a college student he was still thin and weedy. Miles and miles of hiking thru the Maine woods built him up, and the older (by 13 years) Sewall both tested and inspired the younger Roosevelt. The 2 men saw eye to eye on politics, morality and most other things, and you can see the seeds of Roosevelt the conservationist being sewn through his relationship with Sewall. The book details their hunting and fishing expeditions in Maine, Sewall's work for Roosevelt out in the Dakota Badlands when Roosevelt tried to make a go out of raising cattle, and the correspondence and occasional contact they had thereafter, right up until Roosevelt's death in early 1919. The author has a snappy, funny, breezy style. Sewall was also a pretty witty fellow, kind of a cross between Will Rogers and Andy of Mayberry.....so it is a pleasure to read his take on things. It is also interesting to read of Sewall's family history and of what life was like in rural Maine in the late 1800's. My only complaints are minor: The book could have used a few maps....of central and northern Maine, and of the Dakota Badlands in particular. It was also a bit odd that the book doesn't give any biographical information concerning the author. (You can, however, look at his Amazon Author's Page.) As mentioned, though, these are minor quibbles. All in all, an interesting and well-researched and beautifully written account of a relatively little known but important friendship.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R243TL0CI3RXJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608931749#wasThisHelpful","R243TL0CI3RXJH","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a fairly interesting account of John Kendrick's exploration of the Pacific Northwest, and his attempts to open up that area, as well as the Hawaiian Islands to American trade. I had never heard of Kendrick so that alone was enough of a reason for me to read this book. The book goes into great detail about Kendrick's interactions with the Indians of the Pacific Northwest, the British, the Spanish, the Hawaiian Islanders, and the traders and bureaucrats of Macao. The story is a bit disjointed as it keeps hopping from place to place, and just when you are getting interested in one aspect of the story the author moves on to another area.My main problem with the book is that none of the main characters come alive. At the end of the book you still don't feel that you know anything about John Kendrick as a person.....his internal life, his likes and dislikes, etc. Likewise, the Spanish and British explorers and merchants do not emerge as flesh-and-blood people. The author's style is rather straightforward, rather than exceptional. The book comes across more as reportage than narrative.So, I wind up giving this book a lukewarm thumbs-up. It is worth reading pretty much only because it tells the tale of a little known but important historical figure.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IGQFZZO9RFNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061700126#wasThisHelpful","R3IGQFZZO9RFNA","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautifully written book. Rebecca Johns has oodles of talent and the countess of the title is a fully-rounded and fascinating character. You are immediately transported into the late 16th and early 17th centuries.....the language, the sights and sounds and smells, the people....everything rings true. The author doesn't strike a false note and the world she evokes is wonderfully real. Ms. Johns also succeeds in humanizing a woman who has been demonized. Not only can you understand her actions, from her point of view, but at times you can sympathize with her for having to make her way as a woman in a world mostly run by men. But Ms. Johns also lets us see Countess Bathory's faults.....her sadistic streak, her temper and her self-delusion. This character is so real that she truly does emerge, living and breathing, from the pages of the book.My only complaint is the rather bizarre choice to put in a prologue that tells you right away what is going to happen, so that there is no suspense. If the author were a lesser writer, this decision might make you lose interest or at least reduce your enjoyment of the novel. Be that as it may, even though I knew what was going to happen to the countess I was still caught in the web that Ms. Johns has woven. A remarkable book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22LVLGS4OQGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307588459#wasThisHelpful","R22LVLGS4OQGC","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this was an interesting theme for a book. If the author had chosen to just write about the ""death pageant"" for Lincoln's corpse I don't think this would have worked. It would have been too much of the same thing. As it was, at times I got a little bored reading about the arrangements made in each city for the display of Lincoln's body, how many people lined up to look at him, etc. To his credit, the author realized there was a limit to how much of this he could present to the reader so he widened the scope of the Lincoln portion of the book to include some historical snippets from Lincoln's lifetime. We see a distraught Lincoln, in 1862, mourning for his son Willie, lose his temper when an insensitive lout badgers Lincoln for a job, even though the White House is draped in black crepe and it is clear someone has just died. We also see Lincoln, positively boyish, ""trying on"" Jefferson Davis' desk for size at the ""Confederate White House"" in Richmond.However, to me, the section of the book dealing with Jefferson Davis' departure from Richmond just before the end of the war in April 1865 was the more interesting part of the book. Whatever you think of the Confederacy, the author does a nice job of presenting Davis as a honorable man, faithful to his cause and not out for personal gain. Davis did not leave Richmond to save his own skin. He hoped to get out west past the Mississippi to rally his forces and to keep the war going. Interestingly, John Wilkes Booth did the south an immense disservice when he assassinated Lincoln. Lincoln was willing to let Davis escape. He was not interested in jailing him or putting him on trial or executing him. Lincoln also would not have treated the southern states as harshly as Andrew Johnson did during Reconstruction. Without spoiling anything with too much detail, Davis' life after he was captured by Union forces was surrealistic and fascinating.Another plus for this book was that there were some great photos, many that I had never seen before. There is even a photo of the bullet that killed Lincoln, as it was saved after the autopsy. Gruesome, but you can't help wanting to look at this little piece of lead that caused such grief and changed history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSH2E9IQA0IUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061233781#wasThisHelpful","RSH2E9IQA0IUI","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Laura Hillenbrand must have thanked her lucky stars when she found Louie Zamperini and made him the subject of this book. Zamperini, still alive and kicking (an apt description as he was a famous runner in his youth) at 94 (this month) hit the nail on the head when he told the author, ""I'll be an easier subject than 'Seabiscuit', because I can talk."" Well, he may have been easier in the sense that he could relate many, many stories concerning the incredible things that happened to him during his lifetime, but things couldn't have been all that easy as it took Ms. Hillenbrand seven years to research and write this book. For the reader, it was worth every day of those seven years.If you had the imagination of Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis combined, you couldn't come up with a life nearly as interesting or action-packed as Mr. Zamperini's. A wayward, rebellious childhood was followed by an obsession with running. When I was a teenager in the early 1970's I was a pretty avid follower of track-and-field and knew something of the history of long-distance runners, but there was a gap in my education as I had never heard of Mr. Zamperini. But in 1930's California he was hot-stuff, and he held the high school record for the mile for around 20 years. He made the 1936 Olympic team and although he came in 7th place in his event he ran the fastest last lap ever. He got to pal around with Jesse Owens and had the (admittedly dubious) distinction of meeting Goebbels and Hitler. He expected big things at the 1940 Olympics but the games were cancelled due to WWII.So far, we already have had enough for a ""normal"" book but Mr. Zamperini's experiences as a bombardier in the Pacific theater raise ""Unbroken"" to a higher level. He was shot at and (almost) downed. Then he was in a plane that wasn't shot at but wasn't airworthy and it crashed. He was adrift at sea for a month-and-a-half in a 6 foot raft, with 2 companions. It is no exaggeration to say that Mr. Zamperini could have suffered death by starvation, death by thirst, or death by shark. Take your pick. (One companion did die.) After the 6-7 week ordeal, the 2 remaining men were picked up by a Japanese ship. Again, the ordeal by sea would have made a book by itself. But there's more.....The remainder of the book deals with Mr. Zamperini's experiences in various Japanese POW camps. The Japanese didn't believe in surrendering. They encouraged their own men to fight to the death or to commit suicide to avoid capture. Needless to say, with that attitude they didn't care much what they did with allied POW's. They were used as slave labor, barely fed, and were beaten severely for infractions, real or imaginary. This part of the book is not for the squeamish and it makes you wonder how anyone who survived ""life"" in these camps could come out a reasonably normal human being. (Indeed, many POW's became physical and/or mental wrecks.) I don't want to ruin the story by saying how Mr. Zamperini coped, but it wasn't easy. After the war he was a mess for awhile, but eventually he did settle down to lead a productive life helping other people. He also stayed thin and kept himself fit by continuing to run for exercise. In his sixties he was still running a mile in under six minutes and in his seventies he took up skateboarding.This was an amazing rollercoaster of a book. I know it's a cliche to say a book is a ""page turner"" but ""Unbroken"" is such a book. I couldn't put it down and read it far into the night, well past my normal bedtime. It was, by turns, funny, exciting, frightening, depressing, sickening and, in the end, inspirational. A great, great book about an amazing man.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HW7U2VXUELD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400064163#wasThisHelpful","R3HW7U2VXUELD8","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really loved this book. I was a bit concerned at the start that it was going to be a bit too ""New Age""...you know, maybe seeing this small, Buddhist kingdom thru rose-colored glasses as a cure for the modern world...but Ms. Napoli quickly put my fears to rest. (I think it's important that the book was written by someone in their mid-forties, who has lived a lot and who has gained some perspective.) To be honest, I don't know that Bhutan brought out anything in the author that wasn't already there. She is very bright and introspective and it seems to me she already knew what was important in life. She is outgoing and has many friends, and is warm and giving and not materialistic. Mainly, she was burned-out by her job and disillusioned about the news business. I think she really needed a bigtime change of scenery, but with her personality we aren't talking about a regular vacation where you go shopping and relax by the pool. She needed something more esoteric and spiritual, and that's what Bhutan provided.The thing I most enjoyed about this book was that it combined diary-like introspection with first-class reportage and humor. Ms. Napoli tells us about the awesome mountain vistas and wonderful, friendly people of Bhutan, but she also regales us with tales of greed (a Buddhist holy-man who is not averse to trying to squeeze a quick buck out of foreigners) and dislocation, as Bhutan lurches, ever so gingerly, into the 21st century. We have a country that is trying to change from a kingdom into a parliamentary democracy, but where the elections can't be held until the monks determine what days will be most auspicious; a country that wants tourism, but that imposes a substantial fee so that only ""the right sort of person"" will show up. (They want rich tourists, not the great-unwashed on a spiritual odyssey.) On a more personal level, we learn how the changes affect the people Ms. Napoli has become close to. In a country where television and the Internet are now becoming pervasive, and the Western lifestyle of conspicuous consumption is on full-display, how do you maintain traditional values? Are you able to?As an extra ""bonus"", early-on in the book the author describes why the University of Texas at El Paso has a campus adorned with buildings in the Bhutanese architectural style. It is a quirky, fascinating little tale.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H7FQQTFFIJZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307453022#wasThisHelpful","R2H7FQQTFFIJZU","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a bit disappointed in this collection after seeing the good reviews. Maybe my expectations were too high? The collection seemed very uneven and I found about one-third to one-half of the entries to be not all that interesting. Some of the entries seemed too long and some seemed not long enough. For example, the first entry was by a travel writer who happens to be gay and he meets a man who he wants to get romantically involved with, only to find out that the other man is only interested in making some quick money as a tour-guide. It was funny, in a bittersweet way, and pretty interesting, but it was only 4 pages long and I felt like just as I was getting interested in the story........it was over!.....Another story was over 60 pages long, and I felt it did not warrant such length.....especially in a book of this kind. That one story just took up too much of the book. Some of the stories just did not engage me, such as the story by the writer who went down to South America to study bats with his scientist father. On the other hand, one of the other stories about rich people who buy apartments on old cruise ships that have been converted into condominiums was just fascinating. These people travel the world, as part of a small but elite community, with the ship as their home. I didn't know anything like this existed and I found the story to be very interesting. Again, I was disappointed overall in the collection. It wasn't as good as I expected it to be. It is worth reading, but you may find yourself bored in spots and you may want to skip over some of the stories.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFWNX1BHSIY6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547333358#wasThisHelpful","RFWNX1BHSIY6P","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tamara Petkevich is now 90 years old. That she has made it to this age is something of a miracle. Stalin's ""camps"" (what a misnomer from an American point of view!)could, and probably should, have done her in. Or, going thru what she had to endure, she could easily have chosen to take her own life. She certainly thought about it several times. That she chose life over death is a tribute to the human spirit in general and to her exceptional inner strength in particular.Anyone who has even a cursory knowledge of 20th century Russian history knows of Stalin's paranoia and the nightmarish world of the Gulag. The book presupposes that you do have some knowledge of the topic, and I imagine that anyone without some background in the subject wouldn't be interested in this book. The interesting question would be, if I already know about this stuff, why should I read this book? The answer is, ""Memoir Of A Gulag Actress"" is a seamless blending of the universal, political and personal.Tamara Petkevich was born in 1920, and was 17 when her father was taken away in 1937. He was a hardworking, loyal, idealistic member of the Communist Party. He hadn't done anything wrong. That didn't matter. He was found to be an ""Enemy Of The People"" and was carted away. Tamara didn't find out until years later, but he died in the camps. Her mother and one sister died during WWII during the siege of Leningrad. Her mother's dead body was removed from her apartment and left by the stairs, to be carted off like a bag of trash and put in a mass grave. Tamara was married and in exile at this point.In 1943 Tamara was taken away and put into the work camps. She hadn't done anything wrong, but it was enough that she was her father's daughter. Her husband was also arrested and put into another camp. The vast majority of the book deals with Tamara's life in the various work camps. She did hard labor under horrendous conditions, but also at times was able to work as a nurse and as an actress. She was young and beautiful and several people in positions of authority attempted to seduce her, so she had to fend off those advances in addition to enduring the ""normal"" hardships of overwork and malnutrition. She did have a relationship with a doctor who was also serving time in the camps, had a baby, and saw the baby taken away when only 1 year old, to live with the doctor and his ""lady friend"". Years later, after being released from the camps, Tamara tried to get her son back. The doctor had run off and when Tamara finally tracked him down she found that her son, Yuri, barely knew her and had no interest in living with her. She was devastated.The memoir is a relentless litany of the horrible: arbitrary arrests; overwork, sickness and death; false hopes and dashed dreams. Tamara was the victim of so-called friends bearing false witness against her to save their own skins. People were browbeaten into becoming informers, even if the ""information"" was fanciful or just a downright lie. Of course, Tamara wasn't the only victim. Indeed, there were millions who were chewed up, sometimes swallowed, and other times spit out by the system.Tamara served 7 years and was released in 1950 at the age of 30. Even after her release she was hounded and feared that she would be arrested again, for no reason, as so many were. Pressure was put on her to become an informant. To her credit, she resisted that pressure. Many others could not, or did not, resist. It was difficult to find work as ex-prisoners were discriminated against and were treated like lepers. After all, if you had been sent away by the authorities didn't that mean that you must have done something wrong?Tamara writes that her love for her son and her love for a fellow actor named Kolya (who died of disease in the camps) kept her sane and enabled her to resist the urge to kill herself. But the camps took a toll on her body and soul. On the cover of the book is a picture of Tamara when she was 20. She looks young and beautiful, even though there is already sadness in her eyes. (Her father had already been taken away.) Inside the book is another picture of her when she was only in her thirties. She looks much, much older.The only thing that disappointed me is that we don't learn anything of Tamara after approximately 1956. She was only 36 then. I would love to know what happened to her after that point. However, that is a minor quibble. This is a wonderful memoir, and the translation by Ross Ufberg and Yasha Klots is masterful. The book reads very smoothly in English, but the remarkable flavor of the original Russian is also retained. This book will stay with me for a long, long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FPZE29Q7YSBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0875804284#wasThisHelpful","R1FPZE29Q7YSBP","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit, I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this thru the Vine program. I was wary of anything that is ""pre-flavored"". However, I was pleasantly surprised. When you open up the bag the smell is wonderful. And the taste is complex. Some people have complained that the vanilla flavor is not pronounced enough, but I find it to be just right. It is definitely there, but not overwhelming. There is another nice flavor in there which I couldn't quite place, but after reading the ingredient list on the bag I assume it is the Sarsaparilla Root. The coffee is slightly bitter, which adds to the complex flavor. (There is a yin-yang thing going on with the sweeter flavors.) I like a very strong, dark roast and I find that this falls into that category although Starbucks advertises it as a medium roast. Overall, I think this is a winner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBY2SQ4HH5BNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GTR8IO#wasThisHelpful","RBY2SQ4HH5BNV","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this to be a very enjoyable romp thru the life of Elizabeth I. It was especially interesting to see things thru the eyes of a woman historian, telling the story by using Elizabeth's relationships with the important women in her life as the focal point. The author starts off by giving details about Elizabeth's relationships with her various stepmothers, and it was interesting to read that she was close to Anne of Cleves as well as Katherine Parr. Anne usually comes across as a nonentity, if not a joke....you know, the woman who was so homely that as soon as Henry VIII saw her he couldn't wait to get rid of her. But in Ms. Borman's account she comes across as a good-natured woman who was kind towards Elizabeth, and she demonstrated political savvy by not making things difficult when Henry wanted to end the marriage. That way, she kept her head and was well-provided for so she could lead a comfortable and peaceful life. Elizabeth learnt a lesson about political pragmatism from this stepmother.The author goes on to explore many other relationships: most notably Elizabeth's relationship with her sister Mary, Henry's older daughter by Catherine of Aragon, and the relationship with Mary, Queen of Scots. Both relationships were fraught with mistrust and jealousy. Mary was worried about Elizabeth's ambition to be Queen, and was envious of her popularity with the public. Elizabeth was concerned with Mary, Queen of Scots desire to be Queen of England, but it was also fascinating to read about Elizabeth's jealousy of Mary on a purely personal level. Mary was reckoned to be beautiful and a charmer. There is a very funny setpiece the author describes where a diplomat from Scotland comes to see Elizabeth, and Elizabeth pumps him for information about Mary (whom Elizabeth had never met). Elizabeth wants to know who is more beautiful, she or Mary? The diplomat, being a diplomat, won't commit himself. According to him, Mary is the most beautiful woman in Scotland and Elizabeth is the most beautiful woman in England. Elizabeth realizes she is getting nowhere with this line of questioning so next she wants to know who is taller? She figures she's got this contest won, as she was famously tall. But, no, the diplomat has to concede that Mary is taller. Things are not going well.....Next, Elizabeth makes sure the diplomat ""accidentally"" hears her playing the lute. With schoolgirlish surprise she says ""Oh, I didn't know you were there!""....of course she wants to know who is the better musician? The diplomat says that Elizabeth is. Good! Later on she dances for him. (She was an excellent dancer and very athletic.) Who is the better dancer? Once again, Elizabeth wins this contest. She is now satisfied.There are many fascinating anecdotes found throughout the book that show the personal side of Elizabeth. Indeed, the book is pretty evenly balanced between the personal and the political. We learn about the political infighting and plots, but we also see Elizabeth's relationships with the women who served her at court. They were servants to some extent, but not as we think as servants as they were of the nobility and could be quite haughty and conceited. Elizabeth was very jealous of anyone younger than herself, especially if they were attractive. There was a sort of ""Catch-22"" as she wanted to be surrounded by such people as they made for a ""glittering court"", but she didn't want any feminine competition, either. Thus, while Elizabeth wore beautiful clothes and flashy colors and exquisite jewelry, the women of the court were only to wear black-and-white and were expected to keep the jewelry ""toned-down"".There are also many examples of Elizabeth's famous temper. She could really act like a spoilt brat at times, yelling at ""her ladies"" and slapping them if things weren't done quite right. She also was easily angered by all the sexual shenanigans the women of the court go up to. (The book is chock full of clandestine affairs, hidden pregnancies and secret marriages.) However, if you were good at your job and were totally loyal and did not try to outshine the queen Elizabeth could be quite generous and loyal herself.All in all, this is a fascinating study of the political and personal side of this amazingly complex, intelligent, vibrant woman and also of the women in her orbit. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it highly to anyone who is interested in this period of English history. I will mention 2 small caveats. The book presupposes some knowledge of the period. If you haven't done some reading in this area you may find it difficult to follow all the names and relationships. Also, as the author wants to maintain the flavor of the period she quotes extensively from letters of the time. As grammar and spelling were quite different back then you might fight it a challenge to understand what was written if you haven't already been exposed to this sort of thing. But, again, these are minor matters. I found this book to be refreshingly different, extremely interesting and wonderfully entertaining.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKJ4GEL7SHWQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055380698X#wasThisHelpful","RKJ4GEL7SHWQP","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After I read this book I thought, the more things change the more they remain the same. We are fascinated with serial killers today, and we were fascinated with them over 100 years ago when Joseph Vacher went walkabout thru the lovely and idyllic French countryside. Mr. Starr covers all the angles.....newspapers tripping over themselves to sensationalize the circulation-boosting story; courtroom outbursts and shenanigans by the defendant; the ineptness of the local police; fear and false accusations before the actual killer was caught; the birth of modern forensics and the infighting between scientists who had different philosophies (the old nature vs. nurture debate). The author doesn't miss a trick, and the book is beautifully written. Not dry but not sensational, either. You'll notice that I put the word disturbing in my title line. This book is disturbing on many levels. It is scary that Joseph Vacher could walk from place to place and get away with so many murders. Your first thought is, well, this WAS over 100 years ago. But then you stop and think about modern serial killers who also go unnoticed and unapprehended for years and years. It is also scary that a fellow human being could be this disturbed. Vacher didn't just kill people. He mutilated them and sexually abused them as well. If we could write him off as ""just a nut"" I suppose it wouldn't seem so bad. But Mr. Starr quotes extensively from Vacher's poems and letters and he was clearly a sensitive, observant and intelligent man. Sometimes. He was also most probably psychopathic and schizophrenic, wildly unpredictable, devious and manipulative. He was ""crazy"" but was also aware that he was doing ""wrong"" and he tried to cover his tracks. That's why he was held legally responsible for his actions. But as Mr. Starr points out, if a person can't control their urges even when they know those urges are wrong, should they be treated as criminals or should they be treated as mentally ill? It was a difficult question 100 years ago and it is a difficult question today. Whatever your views on the subject, I urge you to read this excellent, thought-provoking book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LNU1M0TJ8B0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307266192#wasThisHelpful","R2LNU1M0TJ8B0R","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full Disclosure: I don't use this product but my wife does, so this review was written after consulting with her and obtaining her feedback. She's been using Tucks for a long time and loves them. They are always nice and moist and are big enough to handle easily. My wife has a lot of allergies and there is nothing in these that bothers her. Tucks does make a smaller container which I think has 40 pads, but she prefers the 100-count pack as the container is easier to handle than the smaller, shorter container. Also, the 100-count pack is more economical. The witch hazel is very soothing and definitely makes living with ""The H-Problem"" a lot easier!

"Great stuff! Strong yet soft, and I love the mega-rolls. We have a tall metal cylinder which accomodates normal sized rolls, so it is a bit of a squeeze to get these rolls to fit, but that's a minor drawback. I like mega-rolls because they have a nice heft and feel luxurious and it seems as though they last forever. It's nice not to have to change rolls every 5 minutes! Pricier than store brands, but it's worth the money for the softness and for the convenience of having rolls that last a long time. Really have no complaints about this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BW6EE6BZHGTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003WJBF0U#wasThisHelpful","R1BW6EE6BZHGTW","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm doing something a bit different for me in this review. I usually make a point of not looking at other reviews before I write my review, as I don't want to be influenced by what other people think. Fortunately or unfortunately, my curiosity got the better of me in this case. I loved this book so much I wanted to sneak a peek and see what the ""average"" rating was. When I saw that the average was about 3.5 I was amazed that it was so low. I didn't look at the positive reviews, but I was curious to see what the people who had given the book one or two stars had written. I won't comment on any specific reviews, but I've digested the negative reviews and I want to respond in a generic way. I think this might be helpful as the reviews, positive and negative, seem to be all over the place and I know that when I'm trying to decide whether or not to buy a book from Amazon I get especially confused in this type of situation and usually end up not making the purchase. So, here goes.....This is, primarily, a book about characterization. As you can see from the description provided by Amazon, the plot is pretty basic. It is true that nothing earth-shattering or really exciting happens. It's not that kind of book. What we do get are some very well-developed characters interacting in believable ways. We get a lot of intelligent and funny, and also nasty and childish, observations about people and their beliefs. I was a bit taken aback that several reviewers were very sour on the book because they didn't like Flora. They thought she was selfish and immature and were bored by her observations. Personally, I thought she came across as a very complex, real young woman. Is she totally admirable? No. On the other hand she is far from being despicable. She is also very bright and has some very interesting things to say about her parents, her surroundings, and life in general. Without giving too much away, I should also note that Flora shows some growth by the end of the book. Initially, she tends to judge people  based on first impressions and she is very suspicious. And despite being brought up in a ""liberal"" environment she mocks people who are religious, without getting to know them. But by the end of the book she is more open-minded and generous in spirit and tends to see things a bit more in shades of grey rather than in black-and-white.The author does a nice job of making these changes seem organic rather than forced.  And the book is not just about Flora. Even though her father is dead we get a very good idea of what he was like as an academic, as a husband, and as a father. Likewise, Flora's mother is very well-drawn and funny, interesting and sometimes obnoxious. Cynthia, the father's ""autumn romance"", is also a wonderfully written character, as is Paul (Flora's ""unexpected"" boyfriend).Besides the characters being carefully developed in depth, Maggie Pouncey does a great job of describing places, things and memories. This is a very well-crafted book. There is a nice balance between descriptions, thoughts, and (really excellent) dialogue. I found it hard to believe that this was a first-novel. I did notice on the product page that you can ""search inside"" so the prospective buyer can take a look and see how the book is written. Take a look and see if the style appeals to you. I know that tastes differ, but all I can say is that I found this book to be an immensely satisfying ""read"", populated with many interesting and very real people, acting in true-to-life ways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23EK7M1JA9W2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307378748#wasThisHelpful","R23EK7M1JA9W2U","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very impressive debut novel by the author, William Ryan. Think ""Gorky Park"", only set in the 1930's in Stalinist Russia. If you loved the Martin Cruz Smith novel, you will love this as well. Mr. Ryan captures the monochrome Moscow of the period, along with the rampant suspicion...paranoid and otherwise. We have an honest, middle-aged policeman investigating the horrific murder of a nun.....horrific because the woman had been tortured before she was killed (an ear, an eye and her tongue were found beside the body, and to add insult to injury the body was left in a church). We know from the get-go that this is no ""ordinary"" murder by some madman. The author makes clear that the killer is a professional, most likely working for the NKVD (state security), and the nun was tortured because she was believed to have been privy to some important information. Again, similar to ""Gorky Park"", we have the scenario of an ordinary policeman getting in over his head, and possibly being manipulated by his superiors. Mr. Ryan grabs our attention right away with the wonderful, complex plot, and the finely-drawn, richly developed characters. The author knows his stuff, and the setting and people seem quite authentic. The characters all have that wonderful, sarcastic, Russian sense of humor, which laughs at life while acknowledging its absurdity. You can easily picture the chilly, damp, dark and dangerous streets of Moscow, with orphaned children (whose parents have been killed or taken to the ""camps"") prowling the streets like wild animals, trying to survive. I know it sounds like a cliche, but this book is the genuine article, a real page-turner, and it held my interest from start to finish. I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves a good mystery or ""police procedural"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R187PWS4B863AL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312586450#wasThisHelpful","R187PWS4B863AL","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this was a very solid book concerning the crash of a military training flight in the High Sierra in November 1942. There were 4 men on the flight....the pilot and three cadets. All were in their twenties. One body was located by happenstance in 2005 and another was located by the author of this book in 2007. To date, the other 2 bodies are still missing. The author does an impressive job of covering a lot of interesting topics: We get a brief biographical background of each man so that we feel, to some extent, that we have gotten to know them; the author tells us about the training each man would have gone thru; we learn about the capabilities and limitations of the aircraft they trained in; we also learn about the geology of the area and the weather conditions in the High Sierra and the difficulty of flying in the mountains in general. The author has done a lot of research and has spoken to many people to come to his conclusions concerning why the plane was flying in the direction it was heading in at the time of the crash, and the most likely scenario concerning the cause of the accident. I thought he did a great job of covering a lot of ground and providing a lot of interesting detail in a relatively short book. There is also a wonderful photo section and the author mentions that he has additional photos on his website. I think this book is well-worth your time and I heartily recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U7LNWVNWSC54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0899974759#wasThisHelpful","R2U7LNWVNWSC54","A3N6PCOSINNGFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N6PCOSINNGFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When I got it, it was basically fully charged, I just topped it off.Like other reviewers of said, I believe this is really the best all-around package like this available from Brightech - and maybe anyone else!easily 5 starsJim","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLHBI7Z73QQD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8H4KH2#wasThisHelpful","RLHBI7Z73QQD5","A3HNLJGBLFBJIA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HNLJGBLFBJIA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My dog ( A whippet) is a fairly picky eater, I usually break up small soft treats to enhance his food to get him to eat.Mixing wet food in left his dry food too wet.When I tried this it is a very good consistency - it's like toothpaste so it doesn't soak the food - and he loved it! :)The list of ingredients is all ""human grade"" and is limited, meat, berries, water, oatmeal etc.The pack itself is pretty small, I would say it would last about 5 feedings more or less depending on the weight.I can also see this being used for medicine - it's thick enough to hide a small tablet in it with the food!****Jim","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VKR9R8X8H5AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKLCRN4#wasThisHelpful","R2VKR9R8X8H5AH","A3HNLJGBLFBJIA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HNLJGBLFBJIA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My dog is a fairly picky eater, so I like the idea that I can swap out flavors of food so he doesn't get bored (I usually break up a little bit of treats to mix in).As dog owners know swapping foods usually leads to .. well a mess :)Switching over to this food is initially done the same way ( slowly mixing it with the old food until you finish up with mostly new and a little old food )From there (theoretically) you can swap out the flavors without any problems.I first made sure I was able to get more of this locally if needed ( I was ) and I tried it, he does like it and I can swap it back and forth!He does have an iron stomach however, if your dog has a sensitive stomach your results may vary, you know your friend best :)So far he likes the variety of foods and he eats it without treats ( or begging or negotiating!)It's a neat idea, and he seems to agree!****Jim","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OESQZCRP66KG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZA2L9XA#wasThisHelpful","R2OESQZCRP66KG","A3HNLJGBLFBJIA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HNLJGBLFBJIA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the fit and finish of this coffee grinder. you can tell a bit of care was put into designing it, it's sleek and has a minimum of parts.Since it's hand cranked, it is very compact, the handle lifts off the top so it takes up barely any room on the counter - you can even keep it in the silverware drawer or utility (aka junk) drawer!The instructions are printed on the box itself, it's basically pretty easy, you can adjust the grind, although there are not definitive settings, you just need to do some samples while adjusting the set screw. It comes with a stiff brush for cleaning.I only make coffee for myself so I don't grind too much, so for me being hand-cranked is no biggie - it smells nice, is quiet and the grind is just the way I like it.Very nice!****Jim","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PLHNEUKCTWYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE40XE0#wasThisHelpful","R3PLHNEUKCTWYH","A3HNLJGBLFBJIA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HNLJGBLFBJIA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was a bit skeptical when I was offered a chance to review this cutting board set in exchange for an unbiased review.Three quality boards for only 11 bucks?  I am very happy to say that I am pleasantly surprised by just how nice these are!They smell nice and the handle hole is perfectly sized. They are about an 1/2"" thick - plenty strong without being bulky; and the 3 sizes are a nice overlap in size, there is a definite difference in sizes.Being vegetarian, I am *ALWAYS* chopping and cutting veggies and fruit, so I can say so far I have been really hard on them and they are taking the challenge! I use the smallest one pretty much only for onions, garlic, scallions, olives and after a quick wash is smells fine!With any wood cutting boards if they get ""old looking"" a quick wipe with oil will have them looking great again; so far these haven't needed that.Really nice quality and so far - so good - well back to the chopping block ! ;)****Jim","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7J9BKQGXTEG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WCAPEJ8#wasThisHelpful","R7J9BKQGXTEG8","A3HNLJGBLFBJIA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HNLJGBLFBJIA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was asked to test and review this unit in exchange for an unbiased review - I'm glad I said yes!The unit came faster than the estimated time and in perfect condition. I wanted to test it because I never had a mount that is magnetic- meaning that you can pull the phone with suction mount right off the other half (to use the phone for a minute than put back on windshield) I have to admit that's pretty cool! I do have to grab the phone a lot when I'm on the road, to it's neat to just literally grab it, use it for a few seconds, and pop it back into the magnet.The magnetic mount DOES hold the phone perfectly - I was worried that it would shift down (or fall off) but nope - it's just fine. The suction cup holds onto the windshield great; the other side that suction cups to the phone needs a nice flat surface, so keep that in mind if you have a bumpy phone case.Being that it only holds it from the back and only has a ball joint with no adjustment screw it has a very minimal footprint, great for smaller cars/windshields,I really like it, I think you will also!****Jim","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R193I9HDGEPJC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJ7AGVC#wasThisHelpful","R193I9HDGEPJC3","A3HNLJGBLFBJIA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HNLJGBLFBJIA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So when I was offered a sample bottle for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review I accepted.To be honest I typically went for  the cheapest bulk buy of these, but since taking these (for about a month) I do notice that there is less aftertaste with these -to me anyway- than the other, cheaper brand(s) I have taken.I always thought it was just one of those things to expect, until I tried these!I can't really comment on the ""fish burp"" - I rarely had a burping problem before - with these I still don't.The size is a tad bit smaller than when I have been taking, but if you have taken fish oil before, you know they are kinda large.I'm not going to say they are pleasant tasting -- because-- well it is fish oil! :PSo far, I like these, I will definitely buy more when these run out.****Jim","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JRPR7ZPZ1Z5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDGJIAW#wasThisHelpful","R2JRPR7ZPZ1Z5D","A3HNLJGBLFBJIA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HNLJGBLFBJIA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was advised by my doctor that I needed more Vitamin D in my diet, so I have been taking a supplement for almost a year now.

"I was invited to try this floor lamp for an unbiased review and to be honest, i was not expecting such a warm soft light from an LED lamp!The quality alone in this lamp is flawless. the finish is perfect. The base is nice and heavy, the sections connect together perfectly. What else is cool, is that the power does not string through the sections they plug into each other internally, so it looks like it you didn't want to extend the lamp to the full height you don't need to (I have mine fully assembled, it's  6ft.)The lamp itself is awesome it has three settings, each is noticeably brighter or dimmer than the other.I noticed no hum or interference.Finally since it is LED it does not heat up the room (and of course, saves energy) the lamp shape is nice and compact - super sleek.Not .such more to say this an awesome lamp, toss in the fact it's LED, it's downright incredible!*****Jim","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R129OQOK6D4QH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UW2BMSA#wasThisHelpful","R129OQOK6D4QH5","A3HNLJGBLFBJIA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HNLJGBLFBJIA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is really a cute item! The ""apps"" are tactile touch, and all do different things depending on the letter and level. ( B for Ball, P for Puppy ) for example. On level 1 it's very basic, level 2 begins to asks them questions and level 3 takes it a bit further with storytelling.It's easy to switch levels with the slide button - (which can be a problem since your youngster can also easily change levels also)It's neat and fun, what is nice especially is that it can be dropped ( it has several times already) without worrying the costs associated ruining your iPad or Kindle or other tablet!Mine came with batteries installed and the tablet was working as I opened the package, I don't know if is supposed to be like that, but so far the batteries are still fine.If you have already introduced them to an actual tablet then this may bore them, but I still think it's pretty nice, cute and a good teaching tool.****Jim","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY98RLL3V4UNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHQDZ42#wasThisHelpful","RY98RLL3V4UNW","A3HNLJGBLFBJIA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HNLJGBLFBJIA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Being vegetarian I steam or stir fry veggies, tofu, noodles just about every night.The wok is heavy for it's size - they call it ""professional weight"" - this gives nice even heating. The handles are nice the handle on the front edge is a nice touch.The issue I thought I was going to have is that most ""authentic woks"" are not non-stick - rather many have dents or dimples along the sides so when you are stir-frying you can slide the items you don't want in high heat or oil on the sides, the dimples hold them there.How they get around this is that they have many slightly indented ridges that go around the wok, this does help to hold veggies along the side - nice! The non-stick coating does let you cut back - or eliminate - oils in your cooking unless you want them for flavor.I have had no problems cooking; the flat bottom works great on my gas cook-top.The steamer ( bamboo 2 levels ) works well with this wok it fits perfect, the chopsticks - also bamboo - are cute and nice and long so you can use them for cooking.Overall, This is a nice combo set for someone who doesn't have a steamer and wok. To be honest even if you didn't get the steamer this would still be a good buy!****Jim","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSZ8F3EN79482/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHLXAMQ#wasThisHelpful","RSZ8F3EN79482","A3HNLJGBLFBJIA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HNLJGBLFBJIA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"June 3 update- I changed my rating to 5 stars, the capacity is better than I thought and I found that I have been using it more and more around the house - for example- crumbs on dog bed - gone!I really like a lot about this vacuum! This is a very handy, light, maneuverable - yet powerful - vacuum that I use daily in the kitchen.It is a two-in-one, and when separated, it resembles a Dustbuster, when snapped back into place you get a neat what I call ""vacuum stick""It is very easy to operate, the head swivels like a snake. It fits right up to wall and around furniture legs.It easily gets all the crumbs my dog ( and I )  leaves around!There are two speed settings, usually ""normal"" is perfect. The battery life is very good also. The capacity of the dust collector is very good,its again - the size of a Dustbuster's - maybe a bit larger - it also has nice washable filters.I guess the only downside is the ability to turn the brush rotation off - while it is very soft - it would be nice to be able turn it off to save the battery or just to have it off when you don't really need it.****JimPS. Note on charging - The location to charge it is in the back of the main unit you will see a bump with a hole in it.Why am I telling you this? It's NOT marked and all the holes (for the screws) look the same in the dark blue color!You have to look to see with a flashlight ""hey that's not a screw, that's the battery jack"" - there is nothing showing it in the instructions - I'm not too proud to say I sat there looking at the vacuum for about 10 minutes trying to figure it out :) Once you do - the battery charge light will glow until fully charged then only pulse on at random times- nice!.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QYDEDC27WW6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1P3WNE#wasThisHelpful","R1QYDEDC27WW6S","A3HNLJGBLFBJIA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HNLJGBLFBJIA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK.. first with the ""bad"".. This isn't really ""Big"" in my opinion, the inside usable area is 10"" x 6.5"" x 4 (with the bare minimal egg-crate top padding only, 3"" with one layer of foam padding and 2"" with all layers) So plan your purchase accordingly, you may need the larger one.So with that being said this case is INSANE! It's pretty much the case you should put your favorite gear in.I use it to hold My Rebel, lens & accessories that I use at work. I usually am taking the camera on the road and use it to take pictures of hydrants, utility work, inclement weather etc.. so it gets tossed around.I usually use a back-pack style bag - but this is SO much better, I like it's waterproof and shock properties, plus it's just the right size to hold my gear safe and sound. It also comes with a strap but I just use the handle like a lunch box.Speaking of dust and water resistance- It has an air pressure compensation valve by the handle. On it, it says ""Auto Pressure Valve IP67 Rated"" so I did a little digging and found out what IP67 means found this on SourceTech411:""The two numbers in the IP67 rating code rating refer to: 6 – ” Dust Protected “; Totally protected against dust ingress.; complete protection against contact 7- ” Immersion Protected “; Protected against short periods of immersion in water.Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1 m of submersion).Test duration: 30 minutes;  Immersion at depth of at least 1 m measured at bottom of device, and at least 15 cm measured at top of device""So I feel confident in the dust and water resistance of this case for sure.The foam inserts are pre-scored into 1/2"" squares you pop out the ones you want to help fit your gear in very easily.The two snaps clip into metal bars with a very solid click.While I am not going to drop this in acid, water or a dust-storm; I do trust this case with my camera, memory cards and even my phone -  this is a tough case!*****Jim","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4NQBWRSJOBC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKYZ3TA#wasThisHelpful","R4NQBWRSJOBC6","A3HNLJGBLFBJIA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HNLJGBLFBJIA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I came to a moment of clarity and had to stop. This book reminds me so much of those days (both good and bad). I totally get where she is coming from. It's terrifying to just ""not know"" what the hell you did, how you got to your bed, couch or floor..who you insulted or angered, or if you were the life of the party! (Luckily for me, I was a ""happy drunk"" and was responsible enough to drink either at home, or walking distance or have a ride home.)

"Epson makes superb computer printers, and the Epson  Expression ET-2500 EchoTank is not an exception.  The only problem in the past (for me)has been in ink supplies, and the cost per page of photo prints.Previous Epson printers were priced lower than this one.  Epsom could do that because they profited from expensive ink cartridge sales.  But this printer comes with two years of ink supplies - expensive cartridges not needed.  (note that  the ink supplied, with the printer, is equivalent to 20 cartridges, or 5 complete sets.)  Just  squirt ink into the reservoir containers.  Epson gets their rightful profits up front, and also makes printing more affordable  .In fact, when initial supplies are used up, users can use any brand of inks of the same quality.  And sticking with Epson inks should also be very affordable.  Users will have a choice.You should also know that Epson has built-in this feature into a whole line of new printers.  While this one is probably ideal for most consumer users, you may have special needs and prefer one of the others.  .I think this is the fastest printer I've ever owned, and the image quality is the best. The only problem that I have found so far is that the printer won't t print edge to edge on 4""X6"" photo paper, and these unwanted boarders are not the same on all sides.  Epson will probably fix this when they update the app, but I don't know this for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38S90EHOTOPSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JHMG#wasThisHelpful","R38S90EHOTOPSY","A11KZ906QD08C5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11KZ906QD08C5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd like to make some comparisons of Remington's PF7500 with Panasonics ES81035.  To start with, the Remington's appearance kind of reminds me of a tank, while the Panasonic has a shiny silver finish  and an artsy curved handle.  Both use lithium batteries, floating heads (Panasonic's is more flexible), pop-up trimmers, head guards, and power adapters.  The Panasonic can be used in the shower,  The Remington can have it's head washed in water but cannot be submerged.  Both should be dry before each use.  I purchased the Panasonic on sale for $59.98.  That's close to twice what the Remington costs.I can't know the lifespan of either, but the performance is about the same.  I've been shaving one side of my face with the Panasonic, and the other side with the Remington.  . The Remington did a shade better on my turkey neck, and the Panasonic did a shade better on my wrinkled cheeks.  I'm satisfied with both for quality of shaves.Here's a tip to get the most comfortable shaves: I use a lubricant like a jell or a regular old fashioned shave cream as a shaving prep.  I can even do this with the Remington because its head can be cleaned with running water.  I found no problem using the same shaving prep on both electric shavers.I like this Remington shaver: it can be used plugged into the wall or on  battery. The Panasonic works only on battery.  While I like my Panasonic a bit better, the quality of shaves is near identical - and the price is close to half.  I'm glad to have the Remington shaver as my back-up.  .I.believe these are most of the pertinent facts.

"The Ziploc Space Bags arrived this morning and I put one of them to immediate use.  I live in a small one bedroom apartment and I will quickly make use of the rest of the bags.  I'm grateful to get them at no charge - just for being a Vine Reviewer.

Just (1) fold the cloth goods you wish to shrink for storage inside and Ziploc closed; (2) attach the vacuum cleaner hose;  :(3)  turn the vacuum cleaner on; (4) when the goods are fully reduced in size, turn off the vacuum cleaner ; and (5)  remove the vacuum cleaner hose.  (A one way valve will immediately close, preventing any leaks.)  The resultant package will be reduced to  about a third the original size.

"Yes, the sound quality really is quite good for its size.  Furthermore, it is attractive, strongly built, and I think the price is reasonable.  I give it 5-STARS.  I like it.  The more I use it, the more I like it.  Better sounding Blue-Tooth speakers may exist, but they are more expensive and considerably larger.  This one is designed for both outdoor and indoor portable use, and does a great job.I have only tested this on my Kindle Fire. The Kindle sounds petty good without this external Bluetooth speaker.  It just sounds a lot better with it. In my opinion, it's usually worth being an extra carry-on accessory.UPDATE 1 April 2015I am now seeing many Bluetooth players in local stores.  What a great selection.  While this unit is quite good, I now believe customers can find more desirable players at very good prices by shopping around.

"The twin sized mattress arrived this morning.  It was compressed down to a little larger than  the size of the duffel bag I had when  I was in the Air Force.  I'm 76 and live alone, so it was a bit of a challenge for me to set-up.  Thankfully, my efforts yielded a comfortable bed to have a nice nap.  Actually, the mattress  could  have been set-up by an average sized young woman with no problems.The mattress is two sided so it can be used when  turned over come spring cleaning time.  This adds to the life of a mattress.  While shopping around, I've seen some slightly cheaper mattresses for sale that were only one sided, and they weren't even nearly as comfortable.This is actually the most comfortable mattress I have ever owned..  I'm well pleased.Shoppers should also read other opinions, but I think most will agree with me.  This mattress is definitely worth the price.  I paid $149.00 and got free shipping as a Prime Member. It was not gifted to me as a Vine Reviewer.  Even if it were, my reviews are not guided, they are my own opinions.UPDATE: 2/6/15Okay, I've slept on this mattress a little over a week now.  Yippee!  I now fall asleep quicker and  awake in 8 hours feeling refreshed.  This is what I really needed.

"I received this really nice external power bank (P100 SCUD External Battery) free - for only my promise to write an honest review.  My criteria for rating is not only for the quality of the product, but also my level of enthusiasm for usefulness and price listed on Amazon.  Not having  a technologist background in electronics, I  ignore most of the technical stuff.  .Yes, the P100 works as expected.  This is a great carry along for hikers or bikers who carry a tablet and/or a cell phone.  It's even useful for  some flashlights and other small rechargeable electronics that might need charging before reaching home or car.  These are all the uses that I wanted it for.  But for general travel use, I have cheap adapters to charge everything with my car battery or my lead acid emergency carry-on power source.Charging time for the P100 is slow - 8 hours to fully charge the battery starting at zero.  Time for the P100 to charge the batteries of small devices depends on the capacity of the unit and how much charge it still has left.  But of course, it isn't necessary to fully charge electronic devices in order to use them.The P100 is charged using the standard/micro USP connector cable (supplied).  It fits one way to charge the P100 from a PC, and is reversed to charge from the mini adapter end.  (I have a home A/C wall plug-in that works for charging my cell phone at home, and it works for charging the P100 too.)  The P100 has overcharge shut off protection.  Smallish LED's indicate level of charge at various capacities, both when charging and also when discharging.  (button is pressed when discharging.)  The P100's build is very smooth and handsome, but  none the less, it requires careful handling to avoid dropping or getting it wet.  Temperature range for use range from 45 degrees C, down to 10 degrees C.I would recommend this product to my friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLYNVDH8WSYZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHI7HJU#wasThisHelpful","RLYNVDH8WSYZO","A11KZ906QD08C5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11KZ906QD08C5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This how-to electronic book focusses on the greater photographic techniques that the Canon T5i was designed for. That is, all except the video functions.  It states this clearly right up front.  Furthermore, the reader should read the User Guide that comes with the camera first - or at least read both books' applicable sections as the camera is put into use.As the title would indicate, this is a very well written textbook that will give those who are newly acquainted with photography enough information for  them to strike out on their own,  It is clearly written and nicely separated by chapters in logical order.  It not only covers composition and lighting, but it shows and describes some useful lens' and accessories.Persons already well versed in photography will have little use for this book, other than possibly as short chapter reviews of techniques.  But the techniques are standard for professionals and can benefit the new  and advanced amateurs.

"Julian Bell,  being himself a writer and painter, has produced an unusually intimate view of Vincent Van Gogh.  He has done this in part by examining Vincent's letters to his brother, Theo, and matching them in the time space of his paintings.  This results in a new understanding of Van Gogh's drive to free himself to see, and render on canvas, without obstacles.  Also, the complex difficulties,  the lifestyle, and Van Gough's last days will be more widely understood by readers.I'm just a reader, not an expert in any art form.

"This is not my first Canon Rebel camera body, it is only the best.  I also own the T4i, which is also the best.  Yes, there are very few functions between these for photographers to discern a difference.  In my opinion, there is no need to get into those small improvements at this writing.  .Buy the best price.  I got this one for only $525.16, after shipping expense.  With Amazon carrying this seller, I acted with confidence in making the purchase,Wow, just afterwards I found another supposedly ""Black Friday"" T5i  priced at only $399.00.  To me this seems nuts.  Buyer beware.So, what can I tell you?  I do not use the video functions of this camera.  If I was interested in landscapes, and had the extra money, or was trying to become a professional,  I would own  a Canon camera body with a full 35mm photo sensor. All the Rebel series use a sensor size of  multiple minus 1.6."" , or something like that - I'm ignorant concerning math.  Anyway, while this size is much larger than those pocket cameras and phones, it is somewhat smaller than 35mm.I was born with a very quick eye.  I made my living diagnosing a hundred  or more daily specimens to detect early signs of cancer with a microscope.  I've been retired for several years.  Now-days I shoot dogs, children, and adults in a frenzy of (socially respectable) love. These are my joy today..  The whole of the Canon Rebel series is more than enough for me to do great work covering my personal interests in photography.  Even very serious amateurs should be happily satisfied with the T5i - truely.  Just check out the specs and the prices.  And always consider the reputations of the sellers.And I almost forgot: If  you own more than one digital camera, rename your new photo files numbers so you don't accidentally over-print and loose earlier shots when you save new ones.What do I know?  Not much.  I'm just having fun and trying to be helpful to people like myself.Oh yah, follows is my favorite lens for what I use most of the time: SIGMA 50mm - 200mm zoom.  This low cost lens is quite sharp throughout its full range and has no obvious linear distortions or shortcomings that I can detect.  But I'm only comparing it with my several other lenses - all by Canon.UPDATE 30 December 2014:WOW! I now see the price on the Amazon site for this camera body for under $400.00.  This is insane.  The Canon EOS Rebel T4i is selling for a lot more, and really, the T5i is a tiny bit better. Not enough to count, but still better.

"My daughter loves this game! She is a big Adventure Time fan and  has many objects with the characters on them so she was really loving these cards.  The illustrations are top notch, colorful and really capture the characters.  The game is very easy to play and it's fun.  The cards can be kep in the adjoining box for easy storage.

"This bath mat is very nice and luxurious.  It has been used for a few weeks now and even with many washings, there are no loose threads. The mat is plush and the 'ribbing' style gives it a nice simple look.  The only drawback to this mat is that it isn't slip-resistant.  I actually added slip-resistance to it so that it isn't sliding all over.

But with the Epson, it comes with ink tanks and I don't have to guess how much ink is left.  The side of the printer has bars that let you know how much is left.

There is some challenge, like keeping the spinner attached.  It seems to spin right off sometimes.  The challenge cards are ok but nothing that is exciting.

"I never knew putting something so nice together would be so easy! A box weighing about 112 pounds was shipped to us but with a little help from my son we maneuvered it into the house.  It took about fifteen minutes to unpack and assemble the sofa.  There is no screws or nails involved, no tools at all.  The brackets are already attached to the pieces, so it become a matter of sliding the other parts in and using slight force to lock them into place.  The material is very soft and the sofa is deep and plush.  The paperwork says that it should hold 225 pounds per side, but I weigh a bit more than that and had no problem sitting on it.  It's very sturdy.  Although it says it is grey with white piping, I would say the piping is more of a silver or light grey.  It's really beautiful.  Having a cat, I can see where cat hair will become a problem with the nubby fabric, but we'll just use a roller for now and see how it goes going forward.  I wouldn't sit three on this sofa though unless they are smaller. Two adults can sit comfortably.

"Despicable Me Edition Board Game is a fun-filled family game fit for all ages that families can enjoy: choosing which team color of minions movers that you want to take control of. or traveling around the board and trying to roll for Silent Bob so no one can send your minions back to the beginning. This board game is a must have for any Despicable Me fans out there. The only negative issue that I found about the game is that you need a hammer just to be able to press down on the Pop-O-Matic. This makes it extremely difficult not for just children, but for adults as well. The Pop-O-Matic is also not attached to this cardboard version of a board and the pieces are easily knocked off the board. The game is poorly made even though the Despicable Me minions is a cute idea. The game is still fun and enjoyable, but is also poorly executed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R156A1U4E1D4HP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQQTXY4#wasThisHelpful","R156A1U4E1D4HP","A3TAF7M58DN46F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TAF7M58DN46F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a curtain junkie.  It's a quick and easy way to change the look of any room.  I have to admit, I don't just use shower curtains in the shower.  My favorite placement for them is to remove closet doors and hang them there.  A quick adjustment of an adjustable shower curtain rod, and any doorway can be brightened up.  To my way of thinking, you can't have too many to mix and match and change looks.  So, I was really excited to check this one out.Though it isn't handmade lace, the machine stitching is exquisite.  There aren't any snags or missed marks.  It's sturdy, yet lightweight.  The best part is, if your cat climbs up, he won't leave any claw marks!  Where you insert the hooks at the top, there is a stiff binding so it holds shape and drapes nicely.  There's a lovely scallop around the sides and bottom that add a touch of elegance to it.Whether just brightening up your shower or adding to other curtains for display, this is a good buy.  It's machine wash and dry, so easy care.  It doesn't tend to wrinkle so you can store it and pull it out whenever you'd like.  I placed mine behind two other shower curtains for an added touch of grace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDXBZDQ8ASN08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXYDHSK#wasThisHelpful","RDXBZDQ8ASN08","A3TAF7M58DN46F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TAF7M58DN46F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've heard great things about Essie, so I was really excited to try their nail color.  I was quickly disappointed.  It is very thin, and although I used two coats, it was still inconsistent.  I used a base, two coats of polish and a top coat.  Within twelve hours, I have three chips. Usually my polish lasts for about ten days before I have to change it, but that is not going to be the case with this polish. I do like the color though, Bikini So Teeny is very close to the picture and is very pretty after applied.  I just wish it had a better consistency and didn't chip so fast.

"Seriously, this thing makes gardening so easy!I remember growing up that my dad was a huge advocate for Miracle-Gro.  We had the most amazing garden!  Large plump vegetables and the sweetest fruits!  As an adult, his love for Miracle-Gro has passed on to me.  It makes gardening pretty much a no-fail hobby.The problem I have is that I'm forgetful.  I don't remember when to put it on and when I do remember, well I'm just plain lazy.  It's in the shed and I don't want to walk all the way over to get it to put it on the garden.  The LiquaFeed system fixes that problem for me.  I attached it to my outside water spigot, and voila!  Easy peasy!  If I just want to use the water in the hose, I flip the switch over to 'water' and that's all that comes out.  I can water the garden or the kids can play in the water.  Then, when we're playing with the water, it's a gentle reminder that my plants need food too.  Flip a switch and I'm feeding Miracle-Gro to my hungry plants!Since it's the beginning of planting season, I haven't gotten to play around with it much.  I've got my starter plants going and I'm anxious to get them in the ground so that I can really put this to the test this year.  If it's the same Miracle-Gro I've loved my whole life, this will be the easiest gardening year for me yet.The system is light weight, yet sturdy.  It's incredibly simple to use and doesn't take up a lot of space.  When your bottle of LiquaFeed is empty, you simply uncap another bottle and screw it in.  It's as simple as those great little self-watering bulbs you put in your plants.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KNOOLB04YS6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MKB6R0O#wasThisHelpful","R1KNOOLB04YS6S","A3TAF7M58DN46F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TAF7M58DN46F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This mattress came in a wonderful reusable bag.  I can't imagine getting the mattress back inside the bag once it's out, but I was able to find many other uses for it since it's both large and sturdy.After getting the mattress out of the bag, which took some tugging, I found it encased in plastic.  Boy was it fun!  As soon as the plastic was part way off, the mattress popped out like biscuits popping out of the tube!  It emerged soft and fluffy, yet firm and beautiful.I was the first one to try it out.  I laid it on the floor and dived on in.  I can honestly say that's the most comfortable nap I've had in years. The coils are shaped so that you can roll it up, but at the same time they provide just the right amount of firmness to keep you from feeling the hard ground beneath it.  The mattress padding is soft and quilted and begs you to stay on it just a little bit longer.  For the money, this is an amazing mattress.

We find the controls very user friendly and the hidden mic is a real asset while gaming. It really adds more entertainment value when you can chat with others while in a game.  What we didn't like is the sensitivity of the buttons.  Just by laying the headphones down will cause power to come on and off.

I use it almost as much as I use the coffee maker.  Everything is pretty easy to clean and the drip trays come away for that purpose.

It's like art for your floor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H7H2BGJ929ZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHL17VE#wasThisHelpful","R3H7H2BGJ929ZO","A3TAF7M58DN46F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TAF7M58DN46F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The case is slim and surprisingly sturdy.  The way that the inside is designed, instead of having four pieces of elastic in the corners, there's a movable long piece at the bottom and the top.  This makes it easy enough to insert your Kindle or tablet, while keeping it sturdy and immovable.  You don't have to worry about dropping it and your Kindle flying out.  For me, the biggest problem I had with  my previous case was that my young son accidentally removed my Kindle every time he picked up the case.  Thought built for my size Kindle, the elastic tabs on the corners just weren't enough to hold it in place.Though I like how streamlined and sturdy this case is, I did have a pretty serious problem with it.  Because of the way it's designed on the inside, I can't plug my charger in while it's in the case.  For some people, this wouldn't be a problem.  However, I don't normally remember to keep my Kindle charged until I'm getting ready to use it, at which point there usually isn't much battery.  So, for me, this case just isn't usable as anything more than a transportation device when traveling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16AZ3OGPVPMYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LNTNY6E#wasThisHelpful","R16AZ3OGPVPMYS","A3TAF7M58DN46F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TAF7M58DN46F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know how to set up a printer, so the basic set up of this HP Officejet was relatively easy for me. However, the instructions weren't hard to follow if you don't know how to set one up.  I've had an all in one machine before and I've always loved the multi-function but hadn't replaced my old Lexmark in years.  I can really tell the difference in the sleek, fast capabilities with the HP. Everything works wonderfully, and the only thing that took a bit to set up was the Neat system.  You'll be walked through how to set it up but it took me about a half an hour.  I don't use cloud but I do like the scanning/filing option for various personal reasons.  For my use, this printer is perfect.

"I have a spine disease and it's always hard to get comfortable at night.  Many mornings I wake up with neck stiffness and I've tried many different pillows.  I love down filled, but they are usually too soft and memory foam doesn't hold up well.  I've been using the Clara Clark Bamboo Memory Foam Pillow for almost two weeks now and I love it.  I haven't woken up with any neck stiffness in over a week! The pillow itself is pretty heavy, in fact, the heaviest pillow I've ever owned.  It's also thicker than a standard pillow so that took me a few days to get used to.  However, it's still firm and and I'm hoping over time, it doesn't lose that firmness by very much.  Also, it seems to be cooler than normal pillows and that's an additional bonus for me.  I will be purchasing more of these pillows so I have them for the rest of the bed and when lounging on the sofa.

"Black Out is a solid read.  Focused on two groups of teens, the story flips between the two groups until they are brought together for the end.  A virus, superhero powers, teen angst and more are in this scy-fy dystopian thriller.  I didn't love it, and I didn't hate it.  My main issue was the fact that I didn't relate to any characters.  Not because of the age difference, as I am an adult, but because the focus wasn't on anyone in particular, but all over the place.  The storyline is solid and the plot moved at a quick pace.

"Smart Hydro is a great idea!  It's a great water bottle with a holder that carries your smartphone.The water bottle is made of a sturdy, pliable plastic.  It's high quality and durable.  It doesn't hold a lot, but it will hold enough to sustain you during your run.The holder is made of a soft neoprene and has velcro closure so that you can secure it snugly over your hand for the best fit possible.  It's quick and easy to position.The smart phone holder doesn't hold all phones, but it will hold most.  It's designed for iPhone 5 and Galaxy s5, so if your phone will fit those specs, then you shouldn't have any issue.  There's a clear plastic cover that allows you to use the phone as necessary while it's encased.As a running/jogging aid, this thing is awesome.  You can play your favorite music and be phone accessible while holding your hydration comfortably in your hands.  There's even a handy little spot where you can plug in ear buds.The biggest issue I had with this, is that it isn't designed for some of us with smaller hands and shorter fingers.  Though my hand fits nicely around the water bottle, I have to use my other hand to access phone features.  I think a slight change in the design on the bottle would have been handy.  Then I could use my thumb to access my phone while holding the water bottle.  Over all, though, great success and a useful gadget.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TB4EQOSLU1ZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBEVKNO#wasThisHelpful","R2TB4EQOSLU1ZL","A3TAF7M58DN46F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TAF7M58DN46F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like these hoop earrings.  They are very lightweight.  Usually I don't wear hoops because after a few hours, they hurt my ears.  I wore these all day and forgot I even had them in.  They are so light! Very easy to snap the enclosure.  Usually with hoop earrings I struggle trying to get them closed but you can either snap the rod down into place or gently pull back on the hoop to slide it into place.

"I am in love!  This is seriously the best larger-sized building block set I've encountered.When you open the box, the entire thing is in one piece.  You just pull it out, no assembly required.  To engage the legs, simply pull them out and push them up.  They hold tight and sturdy.  Next, rotate the middle lock.  Then the top of the table comes off in four easy pieces.  All of the cool building block toys are inside!  Plenty of stickers are included to enhance creativity.  Not only do you get plenty of building blocks, you get a crane and a dump truck and a cool little smiley man!!  So, pull out the interior pieces from the storage space, set the road back up, and play!  There are handy little bins on the side of the table that double as both holders for pieces as you're building, and easy carrying devices once it's folded up.We've had hours of fun with this set!If you have a little one who's just getting into building blocks, I can't imagine them not loving this set.  It's easy to open and play with.  It has plenty of storage space and bright colorful pieces.  The entire set is made of sturdy plastic and the pieces interlock beautifully.

Everyone, from my special needs 9 year old to us crazy adults, have a blast seeing if we can outdo each other.This Mega Blocks tub is wonderful!

You also get plenty of 'regular' pieces to work with, and it lots of colors.The blocks are made of sturdy plastic and snap together easily and securely.  There isn't any issue with taking them apart and rebuilding.The only problem we had with this set is that there was no instruction booklet included.  We really wanted to build the boat that's shown on the box, but you can't really see it well enough to figure out the entire construction.  After several hours, we gave up and built something else.Over all, this is a great success for us!

"This is such an overwhelmingly neat toy!  My son fell in love with Marble Racing games, and so we knew we had to have this one!It's complicated looking and colorful!  The instructions are mostly clear and they have colored illustrations to help. Also, several extra pieces were included just in case you need them for building.The pieces do snap together quite nicely for a snug fit.  This helps keep it sturdier after building so that it can be moved and played with, or then moved and stored for later use, without having to rebuild every time you want to play with it.  We did notice that the base pieces seem to shift more than the other pieces, but the spots for the towers are clearly marked, so you just snap them back in place.The best part of this toy is that it provides hours of entertainment with very little work.  You drop the marble in and watch it go crazy.  Then, when it reaches the bottom, it flies right back to the top and starts over!  It's like going down the slide repeatedly without having to keep climbing the ladder!There are some built in safety features that make this toy great, but I still wouldn't suggest a child put this together alone.  The enormity of the project and the bite of some of the pieces make it a bit more challenging.  It's an amazing parent/child project though and I'm so glad we did it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJQ5HXV4LVLB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GB36A7W#wasThisHelpful","RJQ5HXV4LVLB1","A3TAF7M58DN46F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TAF7M58DN46F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used this grill several times in the past week.  It's just so convenient with our on-the-go family! It doesn't take up much counter space and the clean-up is a breeze.  I just use a damp sponge and it's ready to be used again.  I've used it for burgers, fish and vegetables so far.  The lid is hinged so it adjusts to the thickness of what I am cooking.  The juices drip into a tray that is easy to pop into the dishwasher.  I really like the fact that the meat is cooked on both sides at the same time, eliminating a lot of cooking time. The bun warmer is convenient and works very well.  When the burgers are done, the buns are toasty and warm.  No skillets to wash, no greasy stove top makes this a very convenient kitchen must have.

"Wow! What a thrilling ride Lamaitre took me on with Alex! The very first pages grabbed my attention and didn't let go until the final pages were read.  It was not only suspenseful, but only emotionally impacting.  I empathized with Alex in the beginning, then I despised her and then I empathized with her again.  I was shocked with some of her decisions yet I also cheered for her.Camille, the investigator, was a great character as well.  Given a big case after being out of the loop since his wife was murdered was, at first, a conundrum for him.  But eventually, it became just what he needed to get closure in that chapter of his life.  A very intelligent man who surprised me on many levels.Alex is not only a thrilling suspense, it also packs a punch with it's gritty writing and no-nonsense characters.

"Green tea,  is known to be incredibly healthy.  It boosts energy and metabolism.  It can increase your focus. It can improve over all skin health.  It's full of anti-oxidants.  It has been rumored to battle cancer successfully. There's even evidence that one of the antioxidants found in green tea can generate new brain cells. Matcha is finely ground, high quality green tea powder.  It has 137 times the antioxidants found in brewed green tea.  The higher quality the matcha, the more sweet and intense the flavor. It is popularly used in tea, noodles, as a dye, and in Japanese confections.I'll be honest.  I don't like green tea.  For years, I've had people trying to push it on me, stating how healthy it is.  If I can't stomach the taste, it doesn't matter how healthy it is.  Now, here's the problem. What I've tried in the past has been factory brewed and bottled green tea.  Or green tea bags.  I don't care for it at all.  I find it bitter with a chalky texture.Matcha is definitely different than green tea.  It doesn't have the chalky texture and it doesn't have the bitterness.  I still wouldn't call it sweet, but it's definitely more tolerable.  My discovery into Macha has been slow-moving.  I began by putting a teaspoon in with my coffee grounds when I made coffee.  As I became more bold and began to realize that I didn't hate green tea after all, we diversified into green tea milk shakes, green tea and cilantro bread, and every other idea we could come up with.  Eventually, we grew incredibly bold and made green tea cupcakes with green tea frosting. Delicious!  Honestly, my favorite way to consume green tea!  It was sweet, but still had a slight tea-ish flavor to it.Kiss Me Organics offers high quality Matcha that is available only through Amazon.  It's finely ground and organic and can be put into most anything in order to get your daily dose, which is about 1/2 teaspoon to a teaspoon.  I found it incredibly versatile and a great way to change my mind about green tea.

I know I was taller a few years ago but I've shrunk so I measured myself to make sure I ordered the correct cane.Proper fit is essential.  If it's too tall, it will impede it's use and if it's too short, you're leaning over somewhat and if you have a disease like mine, you don't want that extra work for your spine.  The handle is made with birch, the same lightweight wood used in skateboards.  There is rubber along the sides for comfort.The cane is not adjustable.  That is why it is crucial you order the correct size.  Not being adjustable also adds to it's strength, not to mention that the staff is made from aluminum - much like used on a bicycle.  The tip is rubber and I've not problem with it on multiple surfaces - carpet, pavement, store tile... It gives me just the support and security I need.  I like the fact that is is modern and fashionable so I don't leave it at home.  It's not worth a broken hip.  If you're in the market for a sturdy, fashionable and modern cane, then visit sabi.com.  The classic cane is a must have and I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZPX110G130M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FULZ9KU#wasThisHelpful","RNZPX110G130M","A3TAF7M58DN46F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TAF7M58DN46F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those of you who don't know, Speedminton is a whole game based on the classic Badminton.  With Speedminton you don't need the net.  Actually, I remember us playing this as kids and not realizing it was a different game at all.The set contains a durable bag with a clear vinyl cover so that you can see inside.  If you're in the country and a snake or spider crawls in, you'll see it before opening the bag and finding a nasty surprise.  Not only that, it has a strong carry strap so that you can sling it over your shoulder for easy portability.The two rackets are made of sturdy materials as well.  After hours of play, including turning them into swords and sword fighting, there wasn't so much as a ding in a racket.  The cording in the net area was still taut.  They're lightweight and easy to handle.  Being used to traditional Badminton rackets, the foam tape wrapped around the grip handle took me a bit to get used to.  Once I did, however, I won't go back to the traditional racket.  No more blisters from playing too long!Birdie design has come a long way over time.  This set comes with three different ones:  Match speeder, Fun speeder and Night speeder.  These things can fly up to 260 km/h!  They're lightweight and made of a thinner plastic than traditional birdies.  They're still sturdy.  After hours of play, we didn't have a rip in even one of them!When I first pulled this out and showed my son and his friends, I was greeted with groans.  Evidently, Badminton is not cool with teenagers these days.  This was quickly turned around as soon as I showed them the glow sticks that go along with the night speeder.  The night speeder glows in the dark for night play!  This changed the whole game for them.  Every half hour they'd peek out the windows to see if it was dark enough to go outside and play.  They did end up enjoying play during the daytime, but playing in the dark was the highlight for them.  It takes real skill to hit it back and forth when the only thing you can see is the birdie.Thanks to genius night play, Speedminton is a game your entire family can enjoy.  It's a great, healthy activity for all ages and has become quite a challenge to master.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S63P1ZS2EDJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3L53BA#wasThisHelpful","R1S63P1ZS2EDJX","A3TAF7M58DN46F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TAF7M58DN46F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I want to say how beautiful this memoir is.  You always hear the adage that money can't buy happiness and that message resounds loudly in this stunning novel.  I didn't even know who Tony Cointreau was until I read this book, but I feel that I got to know him a bit now after reading.  Growing up with privilege, wealth and wanting for nothing, Tony had no clue what he was missing until he met Mother Teresa.It's a story of  hope, and unconditional love that is sure to keep you completely mesmerized.  Cointreau writes as if he were sitting in your living room having a conversation with you.  He is a spectacular story teller.  I was enthralled with his interaction with Ethel Merman and Mother Teresa - such a gift.  A beautiful memoir that covers many social issues as well as moral and emotional.

"Lawrence has a way with words that will incite many emotions from the reader in this page-turning epic family drama.  The tale spans many years, and many generations but the one constant is that it is about the same family.  It's interesting to see how time has changed views, emotions and society from generation to generation, but to be expected.However, the main topic is abortion and it appears several times in the novel, but with different generations.  It's handled differently and at times, made me very angry.  But, that is the the catalyst to Lawrence's deft way of bringing faith into her work and her characters.  While I loathed some characters and cheered and empathized for others, it was very hard to put down the  novel that ended up staying with me for days, even long after I finished it.

It's just an eye sore in the bathroom that takes up space and makes me cringe everytime I see it but I never do anything about it.But, Surpahs body scale is awesome! It's very sleek and slim.

"When I was growing up, my mom had a kitchen scale.  It had a small plastic platform to put the food and then a hand that moved to the ounce or whatever it was.  She had to first weigh the plate because the platform wasn't large enough to hold the food.  Thankfully, times have changed.With Surpahs kitchen scale, I was able to put it to work just moments after I opened it.  It's very sleek and light - easy to store, clean up and use.

"The synopsis of this book totally grabbed my attention so I was really excited to start reading The Media Complex.  Back in the day, most mental illnesses were misdiagnosed and mistreated . I'm sure most of us have heard the horror stories or seen them reenacted in movies.  It's pretty creepy to think about so I can only imagine what Anne was feeling when she woke up in one and didn't know where she was. She thought she had been kidnapped.Not to mention what her husband, Edgar, must be feeling.  He wants his wife well, but she's done some unthinkable things and he needs to forgive her, as well as seek his own revenge on the person who ruined his life.  Told in the present tense, but in a back and forth format with the characters so you know what they are thinking, R F Roberts unfolds the story slowly, leading the reader on a merry chase to find out what really happened to Anne and Edgar's infant son, and what's really wrong with Anne?With some tense moments, as well as writing that gets into the heart and mind of the characters, The Medea Complex is a riveting, yet gritty read.  I'll admit there were a few dry moments for me, but they quickly dissipated as the story moved forward. A riveting read that was very hard to put down.  If you enjoy historical thrillers based on a true story, then you'll want to pick this one up!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAJ2KONSYE3RV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDFBOII#wasThisHelpful","RAJ2KONSYE3RV","A3TAF7M58DN46F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TAF7M58DN46F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start by saying that this is one of my all time favorite early chapter book series and all libraries that serve young readers should have it.  Not only is Princess Magnolia the perfect blend of beautiful, kind, sparkly princess but she's also rough and tough when she needs to be.  After all, those monsters don't seem to speak any other language, although hysterics seems to have an impact as well.  Princess Magnolia does her best to be in two places at the same time (her birthday party and the goat field) but things just get harder and harder until finally she just loses it.  I think anyone whose been pushed too far can relate to Magnolia's frustration, adult or child.  I've also found when reading this out loud (which is an utterly delightful experience, especially if you use varying tones) that girls and boys love this equally.  And why not, it's got enough princess frills to satisfy the softest heart and enough fighting and action to satisfy the adventurous heart. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HNURWI0G3TEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763665118#wasThisHelpful","R2HNURWI0G3TEK","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have become a big fan of Kids Can Press Citizen Kid series.  These books usually contain an interesting, informative and often inspiring story that promotes wise/kind world citizenship.  The Red Bicycle fits well within these parameters.  The story follows the journey of a red bicycle as it makes it way from a city in America where it has been well-loved and used by a boy to Africa into the hands of a young girl who uses the bike to aide her families' survival.  Alisetta uses the bike to travel to the fields which helps her scare off the birds which raid her families' sorghum fields which allows her to harvest more than normal.  With a larger harvest the family eats better and has a means of transportation to village markets.  Eventually the bike becomes an ambulance allowing medical workers to transport the injured to the nearest clinic or hospital.  I loved this story because it shows the value is one small act of kindness: the boy's giving up his bike when he's outgrown it.  The illustrations are beautiful and strikingly highlight the value of the bike in the lives of those who use it.  I also appreciated the information and photographs at the end of the book which shows the value of bicycles in Burkina Faso, the African country where the story takes place.  Suggestions for places to donate to or volunteer with are also included.  I found the book inspiring and I am now looking for a place to donate my old used bicycle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38WEC6Y531EZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1771380233#wasThisHelpful","R38WEC6Y531EZO","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't quite sure what to make of this book when I first started reading it.  It's really quirky with the narrator being an imaginary friend.  This story revolves around Jacques' discovery that he is imaginary (previously he thought he was Fleur's twin brother that everyone simply chose overlook or ignore). In his struggle to accept who he is he even creates his own imaginary friend (the imaginary friend of an imaginary friend).  As Jacques comes to terms with being imaginary, Fleur starts to think that she's imaginary as well which leads to an unusual series of events.  After attending an anonymous support group meeting for imaginary friends, Jacques is told what to do to become 'free'.  But things don't go according to plan and Jacques ends up experiencing things that lead him to develop a greater sense of self and a great sense of purpose.  While it took me a while to get into the book, I did eventually start to care about Jacques and what was happening to him and the changes he faced.  The book is definitely unique, I can't say I've read another one quite like it which made it hard to predict where the story was going to go.  I didn't manage to predict the ending of the story but really liked it nonetheless.  If anything this story reminds me a bit of Kate DiCamillo's The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane in that it's a journey of discovery and learning to look beyond oneself to love others. The short chapters and humorous experiences that Jacques faces along the way do help make the book a quick read with a surprising amount of character development.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQHQQN21XPYX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525427554#wasThisHelpful","RQHQQN21XPYX2","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Michel's story packs quite a punch.  With the assistance of another writer and a talented illustrator, Michel shares his heart-wrenching story with young readers.  He tells of being kidnapped at the age of five and being forced to help a rebel militia fight against both the national government and local villagers. He speaks of being forced to shoot a friend and being brainwashed into thinking that his family would never take him back.  Thankfully, he never questions his families love for him and he finds the courage to flee when the opportunity comes.  But he still has to live with the horrific memories and confusing emotions that he carries home with him and as his father's humanitarian work further endangers the family, he once again finds himself on the run.  Eventually, Michel made it to the United States but not with his family intact.  What is so admirable is that in learning to cope with the pain he's faced in his life, Michel has learned to speak out and in doing so help others.  The story is told beautifully in the illustrations and text giving the reader a glimpse into a topic that should not be ignored.  However, while not overly graphic, there is violence and some horrible acts briefly mentioned and because of this the book may not be appropriate for all young readers.  I highly recommend this book for more mature middle grade readers on up. A book I will never forget.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NB3596WAL2YH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1771381264#wasThisHelpful","R3NB3596WAL2YH","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book by Abramson that I have read. And I have to say that I quite enjoyed it and definitely plan to read more books by her, especially in the Saints Squad series.  The fact that I have a weakness for main characters that are military men doesn't hurt any. ;)  I enjoyed meeting Craig who is a Navy SEAL but isn't so tough that he shuts out emotion.  It helps that the squad he works with is mostly LDS (Mormon).  As a newbie he still has a lot to learn, but things change quite a bit when he inadvertently runs into a famous young actress named Sienna Blake.  Sienna is in the area to start filming an action movie and runs into Craig on the beach when Craig tackles her bodyguard thinking he's following her.  Things pick up a bit when Craig's unit steps in to help with security at Sienna's sister's wedding reception.  As Craig and Sienna's relation continues to develop despite Craig's unit leaving for a mission, both struggle with how to adapt to the other's very different lifestyle.  But when it becomes apparent that someone is trying to hurt Sienna, Craig steps up his efforts to protect her with compromising his own identity.  The romance between Sienna and Craig was a sweet one and developed relatively naturally (as naturally as a relationship between a movie star and a Navy SEAL can develop).  The details of the mission Craig goes on is interesting and a bit nerve racking as Craig deals with the aftermath.  And Sienna's ongoing struggles with publicity and privacy also add depth to the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MY28K3N7C57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1680476181#wasThisHelpful","R1MY28K3N7C57","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In lyrical prose, McGhee tells a sweet story about a young cricket and firefly who dream of something more than avoiding giants (people), and being typical bugs.

"Friendship is such a big thing, especially in the lives of children as they are still learning about what friendship is and how it does and doesn't work.  I found this book to be a believable story about Anna and her friend, Sadie, having a fight.

At first Anna is willing to do anything to get Sadie back as her best friend, including giving up the necklace.  But after a few days of the cold shoulder and her brother telling her to stand up for herself, Anna fights back.  But it just may be that her efforts might ruin things for good.  Not only is the story one that young readers (6-9 years-old) can easily relate to, but there is an adorable dog in the mix (Banana).

"It can be hard to find adult fantasy that is clean enough for me to want to read it, but Jacob Gowans series A Tale of Light and Shadow fits the bill nicely. Not only are the characters great but the incredible challenges the characters face kept me turning the pages rapidly.  I was slow to pick up this series because I suspected it would draw me in and never let go and I was right.  Once I met Henry and Isabelle I couldn't help but cheer for them but everything was against them from the beginning, including Isabelle's father.  Here is book two, the pair are separated.  Henry struggles to recover from his injuries while longing to go after Isabelle who is now imprisoned in the Emperor of Neverack's palace being prepared to become one of his concubines.  Isabelle struggles to deal with her circumstances and find a way to escape while having no idea what is happening to Henry or her friends. Not only is the plot one that moves along quickly but I loved the depth of the story as each of the characters faces difficult choices and struggles and because of it they grow.  The complications that ensue as each of the major characters makes choices that directly or indirectly effect all of the others made me anxious to see what was going to happen to them.  Even the secondary characters were of interest as I wondered about motivations and choices they made.  A wonderful, thought-provoking new series from an author to watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3765WS8O8IN0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609079787#wasThisHelpful","R3765WS8O8IN0S","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, what a ride.  For young readers who like their books action packed, this book definitely fits the bill.  While adult readers will need to suspend disbelief (men in suits waving swords on the freeway?), younger readers aren't as likely to have as big a problem with this.  And once one moves past the unbelievable parts the reader is left with a book that moves at a breakneck pace from the time Ronan's mother picks him up at school and they go on the run from the evil scientist society, Bend Sinister, until the shocking conclusion, where Ronan has to make a difficult choice.  I do like the fact that Ronan's continuous training helps explain some of his near escapes.  The author does a decent job of setting up the premise of the series (the guard protects the 36 Pure souls from destruction) without slowing down the action.  A nice fantasy read for middle grade readers who prefer action to character development.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U93TVEMA9FD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477816208#wasThisHelpful","R3U93TVEMA9FD3","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whitesides has done it again.  He's written another winner.  I was eager to find out what was going to happen to Spencer and Daisy and their allies in this fifth and final volume of the Janitors series.  After the somewhat shocking end of book four I was definitely anxious to see hour it would all end.  And Whitesides did not disappoint.  Things start off with a bang when Spencer's family is taken by the BEM in an effort to force him to reveal the location of the bronze nails.  This series has been a delight to read with the imaginative use of everyday objects in magical ways.  I've admired the author's ability to make seemingly boring objects (toilet plungers, cleaning sprays, etc.) exciting and fun.  And once again, new inventions and possibilities are introduced (drain cleaner that eats through walls and floors for example).  The book moves quickly into the action and doesn't let up until the end, which one would expect from the final book in a series.  I found the ending very satisfying and even a bit surprising.  The author manages to integrate plenty of surprises in terms of plot and character which made for a great read. I'm actually sad that the series is over. I very much look forward to reading more from this author and seeing what else he comes up with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R62N9Y94PQYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629720658#wasThisHelpful","R1R62N9Y94PQYN","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've fallen in love with Deering's Drew Farthering, a gentleman in every sense of the word.  But Drew also has a penchant for solving mysteries and this one seemingly falls into his lap when a former girlfriend asks for his help.  But the charming and beautiful Fleur wreaks havoc wherever she goes and Drew's fiance is reluctant to have Drew help her.  But Fleur's husband works for Drew and Drew likes him so he sets out to find out who killed Fleur's former lover.  But as Drew's relationship with Madeline grows tense so does the mystery as additional bodies turn up confusing things mightily.  Will faith and love be enough to help Drew solve the mystery and hang on to his fiance? Or will Drew lose that which has the most meaning in his life.Once again I thoroughly enjoyed both the mystery and the relationships portrayed between Drew and his allies, Madeline and Nick.  The addition of an adorable little boy didn't hurt any.  The author manages to beautifully intertwine the mystery with Drew's real and complicated life making for a surprisingly quick read.  The setting also helps set the mood (1930's English countryside) giving the book a bit of a noir feel to it.  The book is presented as Christian fiction but the religious aspects don't it any way overwhelm the story or feel preachy.  Definitely going on my favorites shelf.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXLFO1FPVEGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764210971#wasThisHelpful","R2EXLFO1FPVEGN","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Tillie and Clementine's mother goes out to a meeting the girls are left in the hands of their father who does a nice job fixing dinner and telling a bed time story.  However, the story has unintended side effects when he locks himself out of the house and has to find an alternative way into the house.  Young children are bound to find the book funny and the cartoon illustrations encourage that humor.

"When I heard about this book full of photographs that's a mystery I was definitely intrigued.  And now having read it, I still find it a remarkably clever idea.  First off, the photographs are beautiful and arranged in a way to tell the story.  It's amazing the way the author/photographer managed to take photographs that work so well.  The main characters are the dogs Purdy and Rusty who see their friend Dottie the deer with a purple nose and are determined to find out why.  The dogs start by talking to the animals around them to see who saw Dottie last.  Many of the animals they talk to are different types of birds.  While I figured out the answer to the mystery very quickly, I don't think most children will figure it out as quickly and those who do will be thrilled to be right.  Part of the purpose of the book is to highlight different types of birds from the Americas.  The end of the book shares additional information about each of the different types of birds, as well as information about the ideas and photographs in the book.  A different type of mystery that joins both the beauty of the natural world and a fun mystery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CF0ZCZBV97ZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985804203#wasThisHelpful","R3CF0ZCZBV97ZX","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fire is both an incredibly fascinating phenomenon and a sometimes terrifying reality.  Fighting Fire shares with the reader the terrifying side of fire and the courage of those who fight it.  Each chapter focuses on one of the ten major fires that caused both tremendous damage and in some cases, loss of life.  The book is over 200 pages and so is likely to appeal to more advanced readers, although the many photographs included do a great job breaking up the text.  The text also reads more like a narrative making the book easy to read.  The large font and spacing also add to the ease of reading the book. This book highlights how far civilization has come in the fight against fire while also reminding the reader of the sacrifices that people have made along the way to achieve these advances. This is the type of book that makes history come alive to the reader.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IGKHPP6KMAL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805097147#wasThisHelpful","R1IGKHPP6KMAL5","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes life feels routine with me feeling like I'm just barely making through each day.  Maybe Today addresses that feeling by sharing five ways that life can become more 'soul-satisfying'.  None of these ideas are new, but sometimes it helps to be reminded of the things in life that are most important. I enjoyed the stories and comparisons that the authors make in the book.  For example, Tilt Your Soul refers to flight and how planes and birds tilt their wings in order to take off and fly.  That tilting is compared to tilting one's soul upwards toward's God and His Son, Jesus Christ, through prayer.  The other topics covered are scripture study (Let Down Your Bucket--living water), service (Seek a Compassionate Detour), gratitude (Take Off Your Shoes), and commitment (Be All In).

"The idea of a girl living in the Statue of Liberty intrigued me from the moment I first read about it.  I was grateful to obtain a copy of the book and I'd glad to have read it.  Sarah is the kind of character that I love to root for, who digs deep inside herself to find a way to survive in America on her own.  I found it interesting that Sarah's country of origin isn't ever mentioned but then again it doesn't really need to be, many countries have mistreated their own citizens for a variety of different reasons.  Sharenow explains at the end of the book exactly why he chose to write the book that way (he wanted to share a more universal story) before deciding to base Sarah's experiences on those of his own ancestors.  The story reads surprisingly quickly. Historical fiction can be a tricky thing to write because the author has to balance the needs of the story and characters with the historical reality.  I appreciated Sharenow's explanation at the end where he shares the facts that he changed a bit to fit the needs of the story.Sarah's resourcefulness is what really makes the story, but I also thoroughly enjoyed the other elements that are intertwined with the stories.  Themes of survival, bigotry, courage, and honesty all blend beautifully in this story of a young immigrant girl whose dream of settling in the United States takes a heart-wrenching turn when her mother dies at Ellis Island and she is to be sent to live with a difficult uncle.  Sarah jumps off the ship and swims to Lady Liberty where she sleeps in the crown until the night guard discovers her.  The glimpse of New York that Sharenow gives the reader offers a look at how life has varied greatly for those coming to America and that the American Dream doesn't just jump into one's lap.  A quality historical fiction that gives a thoughtful picture of a particular time and place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R282EU18L227DE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062227955#wasThisHelpful","R282EU18L227DE","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are few places on earth where extreme weather of one sort or another doesn't impact the way people live and work.  It's important to know how to react to these events and even be prepared for them. Kostigen reviews the major weather related disasters that can occur and offers tips on how to prepare and react to them.  Hurricanes, tornadoes, sandstorms, hailstorms, and blizzards are some of the major types of disaster that are covered in this book.  Each type of disaster is briefly described with large photographs illustrating the dangers of these weather events.  Each section also includes a sidebar with tips for preparing, enduring, and recovering from these events.  Additional sidebars included sections on nature's signals (how the natural world indicates that a large weather event is coming) and my favorite, gadgets which shares different devices that can help one respond better to severe weather.

"I'll say straight out that I loved this book.  The characters, the setting, the plot, all of it I really enjoyed.  Eleanor presents an interesting combination of spirit and duty as she strives to accept her father's demand that she marry the Welsh king, Brac Goch.  But from the first she is determined to hate him and everything she's been told he's done.  But she slowly starts to realize that what she's been told doesn't really match up with the man he seems to be, but the what she has always accepted as the truth wars with what her own eyes and heart tell her.  Plus, there seems to be some spirit floating around that keeps warning her not to trust Brac.  Who can she trust?  What is the truth?  Eleanor has quite the set of experiences in front of her adjusting to what amounts to a foreign country, language, and environment with seemingly no way out.The secondary characters were great also, I couldn't help but fall in love with Hawis, Anise, and Lady Margaret, as well as Owain.  The twists and turns were fascinating as Eleanor gradually sorts out the truth from the lies.  A powerful tale about the value of truth and real love, not to mention loyalty and courage. As soon as I started reading the book I felt like I was there watching Eleanor and Brac sort through the challenges standing in their way.  But the book never felt like a copy of the romance story lines that are so common, it felt wholly original and creative and I loved it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8GIWII8H8VLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1680472372#wasThisHelpful","R8GIWII8H8VLW","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unfortunately, he himself falls victim before inadvertently finding a solution which the reader  helps him implement.  The illustrations are cute and reminiscent of cartoons and animation.  The alien mustaches are almost two cute to be the villains of the story, but their motivations aren't completely evil, they just want to turn Mars red again using the ketchup.

This time Dory heads back to school anxious about finding a true friend (a real friend according to her siblings).  The combination of illustrations with text makes for a fast read and appealing story.  Dory's efforts to behave at school while maintaining her unique characteristics makes for a very entertaining read.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching Dory's attempts to befriend a classmate who seems to have a similarly strong imaginary life despite her brother and sister's skepticism.  Dory's imagining's add plenty of humor with her friend Mary wanting to go to school with her despite the 'trouble' she got into the previous year, Mr. Nuggy, Dory's fairy godmother, who promises to turn the school into a pancake before inadvertently turning himself into a chicken, and Mrs. Gobble Gracker, the ugly witch who is always a threat.  The way Dory's and Rosabelle's individual stories come together creates the backbone of the book making for a fun, light read.

"Time travel romances sometimes have a feeling of inevitability to them just because of the challenges associated with them.  So it takes an special sort of touch to make them believable and enjoyable with that feeling of impossibility associated with them.  Larson has done a nice job here answering the questions associated with Sam's 'visit' to the past.  Having Sam visit the past while in a coma and his brother reads to him from an old journal provides context to the things that Sam experiences and learns.  I enjoyed watching Sam learn that while the pleasures of the world might be fun for the short term, long term they offer very little. Same learns this when he befriends a young man much like himself, simply from an earlier era and a beautiful young lady whose younger brother who is dying.  All of this happens in a small farming community where a shocking murder has really thrown everyone into confusion.  Another Time for Love is a quick read with some thoughtful insights about the power of love and sacrifice and learning that service can provide more long term happiness than any amount of goofing off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5W31LK1P4G6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1621086887#wasThisHelpful","R5W31LK1P4G6Z","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But things start to look up when his stepfather's niece arrives for a visit and he finds her attractive and intriguing.  Unfortunately, things take a turn for the worse when the man Drew found in his bedroom is found dead in the greenhouse.

The author does a great job of spreading out the reveals and twists throughout the book.  The setting and time period also make the book unique.

"I have students request scary books all the time and it's a challenging task to find a book that has the right degree of scariness for that particular student.  I liked the fact that Serafina starts off with a bang.  I was immediately intrigued by Serafina's ability to hunt down and catch the rats in the basement of the Biltmore Estate where she and her father live.  It was the first clue that there might be more to Serafina than her rather unusual appearance.  The reader immediately suspects that there might be a reason that they live secretly in the basement and that her father has instructed her to never let herself be seen.  But these questions take a backseat to more immediate concerns when Serafina witnesses a girl in a yellow dress disappearing into the arms of a threatening man in a black cloak and narrowly escapes capture herself.  Serafina is the kind of female lead that I especially like, one who is determined to help despite great risk to herself.  I also loved the setting.  Now I've never been in a mansion but Beatty does a great job of creating a setting that works well with the creepy mood of the story.  So far I would definitely recommend this book to middle grade readers who enjoy stories with a strong creepiness factor.Beatty has created a surprisingly believable fantasy mystery with enough creepiness to satisfy many middle grade readers who request 'scary' books. After I finished this I had a strong desire to visit Biltmore Estate and explore the place from top to bottom, including the surrounding woods.  I also appreciated the fact that the book has a solid ending.  While there is plenty of room for a sequel, the book could also be left where it's at, with all loose ends tied up.  I'm not usually a huge scary book fan, I found that I really liked this one and will definitely be recommending it.  Please keep in mind that readers who get scared easily will probably not want to read this one.  But readers who enjoy thrilling adventures with a realistic setting and a strong dose of the supernatural are likely to enjoy this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2051A9ERBXWDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1484709012#wasThisHelpful","R2051A9ERBXWDR","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Steve Tomecek (aka The Dirtmeister) takes readers on a wonderfully informative journey through the science of our planet.  Starting with the science of the earth's development, he also covers facts about earthquakes, volcanoes, soil, rocks, weathering and erosion.  Each section starts with a fun little comic followed by several pages of description, graphics, and photographs discussing each topic.  The design is fresh and appealing and the information fascinating.  The inclusion of various experiments demonstrating some of the different processes that are presented is an awesome touch.

"The Haunted Library series is one of my favorite series for young readers.  Not only are they easy to read but the mysteries are interesting and the characters fun.  I was a bit startled when I thought I'd figured out the answer to the mystery of the strange occurrences of five o'clock and I turned out to be wrong.  Usually with this type of mystery I'm able to figure out the answer long before the ending, but here it turned out to be something else.  Those kind of surprises are always fun.  Plus, it's fun watching Kaz grow into his ghostly powers as he continues to search for his missing family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQQOWIB1FMRYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0448462486#wasThisHelpful","RQQOWIB1FMRYV","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a sequel to Johnson's The Skeleton in My Closet Wears a Wedding Dress, this book stands fairly well on its own.  Having not read the previous book, the author included enough information from the previous book that I didn't feel completely lost.  Having said that though I would undoubtedly have understood and appreciated Sophia's and Luke's relationship better if I had read the first book.Having married young and been divorced soon thereafter, Sophia has a lot of emotional baggage that she struggles with.  While she is strongly attached to her boyfriend, Luke, she's afraid to express her love for fear of getting hurt again.  Underlying it all is her fear that the problem is with her, that she's not good enough to hold on to a guy.  Mixed in with her emotional struggles are the issues with her former roommate eloping with her ex-husband, her brother's upcoming marriage to one of her current roommates, and the return of a friend from her mission.  I sat down and read this book in one sitting being drawn fully into Sophia's life and concerns.  Being an LDS fiction novel there are references to going to church and to LDS beliefs but they are few and don't take away from the story in the slightest.  I did like the emphasis on the fact that relationships take work and that if both parties don't fully invest themselves the relationship isn't likely to survive.  A clean romance with great characters and a thought-provoking plot that felt real to me and that I thoroughly enjoyed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27K7TEB273DC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1680472402#wasThisHelpful","R27K7TEB273DC0","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jane Goodall's work with chimpanzee's is well known.  I remember hearing about it from the time I was a child.  But I still found this book eye-opening.  The book offers not only stunning photographs and great information about chimps but a look into the dedicated career of a woman who loved animals from the time she knew they existed.  I don't know many five-year-old's who could be quiet and still enough to watch a hen laying an egg.  Clearly, Jane demonstrated an ability to observe patiently from a very young age. Written in a very engaging style, Untamed, shares the power of following one's heart even in the face of great obstacles.  I especially enjoyed the stories about Jane and her chimps.  I knew it must have been a great challenge to go out in the wild and observe a wild animal the way she did, but I didn't know just how difficult. I appreciated Silvey's efforts to share major events in Jane's life with just enough detail to hold a young reader's interest.  The sidebars included information about specific chimps, chimp behavior, and other topics related to Jane's life.  I also found it inspiring to read about the incredible difference that one dedicated person can make in the world if they believe in what they are doing and don't give up.  An absolutely fascinating and inspiring story of a woman that many people know about but don't understand.  The inclusion of additional resources is great for those readers who want to know more as is the information about the organizations that Jane has helped found and support during her lifetime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JCLFPT5FRQCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142631518X#wasThisHelpful","R1JCLFPT5FRQCD","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading Shurtliff's first book, RUMP, a new take on the story of Rumplestiltskin, I was very much looking forward to reading her take on Jack and the Beanstalk.  I was not disappointed.  Shurtliff seems to have a way of taking an old, well-known story and turning it into something fresh and new.  In this version of Jack and the Beanstalk, Jack is headstrong and full of pranks, especially when he butts heads with his annoying little sister.  In fact, one of my favorite aspects of the story is the way the relationship between Jack and his sister, Annabella changes over the course of the story.  The conflict between them shifts a bit as they gain a better understanding and appreciation for each other.  The clever way that Shurtliff relates Jack's adventures in the world of the giants to her previous book, Rump was thoroughly entertaining.For a fairy tale, this story has a remarkable depth to it.  The story if full of themes related to the importance of family, what being a hero really means, the power of story, and what real treasure is.  While containing a lot of the well known elements from the original story, there is much here that is new.  The addition of the small humans as 'elves' serving the giants including in a cobbler's shop, the boy named Tom Thumb by his adopted giantess mother, and the idea that magic has a cost attached to it.  All in all, a thoroughly engaging fairy tale retelling full of adventure, great characters, and important themes.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R341ZD04S8FG5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385755791#wasThisHelpful","R341ZD04S8FG5W","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The combination of illustrations and text makes for a fun read with Humphrey helping out his classmates just like he does in the series for older readers.  In this one, Humphrey goes home with Richie who needs his help in completing his science project, but Richie's new puppy wants to play with Humphrey too.  Unfortunately, Humphrey must find a way to help Richie while staying away from the puppy.

"I am a huge fan of the Scientists in the Field series by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.  They are not only fascinating but well designed with gorgeous photographs.  Chasing Cheetahs did not disappoint, it's as high in quality as its predecessors.  With the growing emphasis on STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and math) in the education field, these books are a great help in that endeavor.  This book takes a look at the work of the Cheetah Conservation Fund's work in Namibia, Africa in saving cheetahs.  The work done by Laurie Marker and her associates has clearly made a difference, but like all conservation stories there is still much to be done as Montgomery clearly shows.  I found it absolutely intriguing to read about the things the CCF is doing to help the species.  The strategies they are using are clearly explained and demonstrated in the book which shows the power of science in action.  I for one found the stories about different cheetahs and the way the scientists study them and share what they've learned with local farmers and school children as well as with colleagues worldwide makes for a great story.  This book is very readable with lots of gorgeous photographs to highlight the text.  A wonderful addition to a great series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LZI9BC7TXGLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547815492#wasThisHelpful","R3LZI9BC7TXGLW","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arnaq, a beautiful young Inuit woman loves her life and doesn't think that any of those who seek her hand in marriage can offer her what she wants, which is to avoid a life of hard work.  When a fulmar (bird) shaman named Qaqulluk shows up and promises her the world she agrees to marry him.  But when she accompanies him home she discovers that nothing he told her is true.  She is left to live in a hut of holey fish skins, eating fish for every meal.  Eventually, her ataata (father) comes to check on her and is enraged when he discovers her unhappiness.  The two leave together, followed by Qaqulluk and his fulmars.  At first Arnaq's father defends her but when the fulmars raise a big storm he tosses her over the side to save himself.  When he cuts off her fingers to force her to release the side of the boat, her fingers turn into whales and seals.  She ends up at the bottom of the sea where she becomes Nuliajuq, the spirit of the sea.  Sea mammals are said to obey her because they were once a part of her.  As the spirit of the sea, she avenges mistreatment of the sea mammals and punished the fulmars for their deception.  This Inuit folktale tells a story of pride, deception, and cowardice and the tragic consequences.  The beautiful blues, whites, and browns highlight the Arctic world in gorgeous spreads.  I appreciated the pronunciation guide at the end and the explanation of the names used in the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLW9HARPWAFH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1927095751#wasThisHelpful","RLW9HARPWAFH0","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Walrus has beautiful spiraled tusks and can catch and eat clams with ease.  Raven must search through the mud to find clams not being willing to try becoming a walrus for fear of embarrassing herself.  But her envy turns to rage when Walrus notices her efforts one day and makes fun of her.  Calling out to the Strength of the Land, Raven turns the surface of the ocean to ice trapping Walrus inside.  Raven encourages other creatures to join her in tormenting Walrus who can no longer search for clams.  When Walrus can't take the torment any more he in turn calls on the Strength of the Land to aide him in making his escape.  This Inuit folktale not only highlights the beauty of the Arctic environment but the power of the land.  This is also a pourquot tale that highlights how walrus's tusks turned out the way they did.  Like most folktales this story has a clear theme: the dangers of misusing power as well as the dangers of envy and rage.  The transformation of walrus is a rather drastic one which the illustrations clearly show.  I'm always looking for folktales to share with my students and this one is definitely going on the list.  My favorite part of this book though is the beautiful illustrations which I fell in love with immediately.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MCRS7A3W7OO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1927095689#wasThisHelpful","R3MCRS7A3W7OO6","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love makes the world go round, love of God, love of neighbors, love of family, and love of ourselves.  Jesus Christ is the ultimate example of real love and Robbins spends most of one entire chapter discussing charity, what it is and why we should seek to be charitable.  I especially liked the chart he included documenting each of the characteristics that Paul mentions related to charity in 1 Corinthians 13.  He included both examples and nonexamples in the chart of charitable and noncharitable behavior.  The point is made that love IS a choice, that falling in or out of love implies that we as humans are being acted on rather than acting of our own choice.  Sharing scriptures and quotes from LDS Church leaders, the author clearly makes the point that we can CHOOSE to love others, especially our spouses and families.With love being a choice, it then behooves us to take 100% responsibility for making that choice.  The second chapter discusses the importance of being willing to be responsible for the choices we make in every respect of our lives.  Robbins presents what he calls ""The Anti-Responsibility List"".  Basically, the list is a whole bunch of ways human beings don't take responsibility for their lives whether it's making excuses, blaming others, letting fear hold sway, or anything else that prevents us from being proactive.  Several examples are given both professional and personal that demonstrate the points being made.Other topics covered in the book include self-reliance, love and agency in family life, as well as counsel on finances and family home evenings. All in all, I found this an amazing book with lots of useful counsel given that I for one need to implement in my life.  I highly recommend this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RD3CDSKZYXWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629720860#wasThisHelpful","R3RD3CDSKZYXWL","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eddie along with his Mum, Tom, Lily, and Tilly go camping at the beach.  After setting up their campsite, they go to bed.  The next day is spent preparing food, enjoying the beach, and visiting the nearby town.  Eddie even takes time to build his own tent.  After visiting the nearby town and meeting a boy named Max and his puppy, Eddie and his family head back to their campsite.  Max and his grandfather come after them to get their help searching for Max's missing puppy.  It takes a rare talent to write a book that balances out the information the author wants to share but keep the focus on the characters.  Sarah Garland has done a nice job here mixing the camping details into the story.  It was fun to see Eddie and his family go camping.  The book has a definite British flavor using British terms and camping activities.  There were some ideas that I'd even like to try the next time I go camping.  Reading about the food cooked over the fire made me hungry.  There isn't anything else quite as tasty as a campfire cooked meal.  The ideas mentioned in the book are more thoroughly explained at the end of the story.

"I have some mixed feelings about this book.  On the one hand it has tremendous young reader appeal but on the other hand there were a few statements that I felt were misleading though not technically wrong.  On the one hand the list of resources the author read and used at the end was tremendous, some specific references on certain information would have been nice.  And while I enjoyed the author's rather snarky, sarcastic tone, I wonder if all children will pick up on it, especially the references to things that did not exist during the Civil War, which could easily confuse some child readers.The author has done a nice job of choosing topics and events that carry a lot of interest.  I found myself compelled to keep reading to find out what else the author had to say.  I even learned some things, which for a Civil War reader like myself says a lot.  The numerous sidebars provide information about topics related to each chapter giving additional information and background.  For each major battle, statistics related to the number of soldiers involved and the casualties inflicted as well as who is considered to have 'won' the battle are included.While I didn't read anything that was technically incorrect (at least as far as I know) there were several places (at least three that I counted) where things were phrased in such a way as to be misleading.  For example, on page 55 the author says, ""On November 7, 1917, Communist supporters of Vladimir Lenin stormed the palace of Tsar Nicholas II, killing the Russian emperor and his entire family and beginning a civil war that would spread across the country.""  While technically that is correct, the Russian emperor and his family were at the SUMMER PALACE when the revolution first began, and while they were killed it wasn't until months later.  So, technically correct but misleading.  A reference to 'Mormon separatists' on page 41 is also misleading in that the Mormons moved to what later became the state of Utah in order to avoid ongoing religious persecution and not to establish a separate country makes this misleading.The illustrations add a nice touch but like most illustrations of battles they involve a good deal of supposition on the part of the illustrator because we have few if any actual battle photographs from the Civil War, though quite a few of the aftermath.  But the pictures definitely add to the appeal of the book.Overall, an engaging book that child readers fascinated by the Civil War are bound to enjoy, but I recommend it with reservations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X8985L98QOE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316320501#wasThisHelpful","R2X8985L98QOE4","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To put it simply, I loved this one.  Kisses in the Rain drew me in from the first page and never let go.  Both main characters, Jace and Georgie, were very sympathetic as they both had some tough challenges to face. Jace has just been dumped by his girlfriend who was just using him to get her old boyfriend back.  Understandably he feels betrayed and as a result makes a bad first impression on Georgie who starts working at Peter & Andrew's restaurant with him.  Georgie is also struggling with major heartbreak having been in a serious car accident in which her fiance died.  But it's more than that as she struggles to remember what happened and to find herself after her fiance's extremely controlling behavior.All the food details were fun. Even though I don't enjoy cooking myself I do enjoy reading about it, or maybe it's just the yummy sounding food.  In any case, I found it enjoyable to read about the glimpse of what it's like behind the scenes in a restaurant.  It was interesting the way Jace and Georgie came together over food.  I think what struck me the most about this book was how real it felt, the way the relationship developed with plenty of ups and downs.  This is definitely going on my favorites shelf with the other clean contemporary romances that I love.  I normally prefer historical romances so that tells me just how good this one is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY9VYZLP0INJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1680472399#wasThisHelpful","RY9VYZLP0INJF","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are some authors that I know I will love everything they write.  Relating to gospel topics, Robert Millet is one of those authors.  I know that when I pick up a Millet book I will learn something that I didn't know before.  The focus of the book is COVENANTS: what they are, their importance in our lives, and the blessings that can come into our lives when we live them.  One thing he points out in the first chapter that I had never thought about but which makes complete sense is that Jesus Christ himself made covenants with Heavenly Father when he stepped forward to be our Savior.  And because he made and kept that covenant he received the connected blessings.  The rest of the book focuses on the covenants that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints make and with the Savior's help strive to keep.  The last part of the book talks about the blessings that are connected to those covenants.  A wonderfully written book that I can highly recommend to both male and female readers.  While the book specifically focuses on men, it's useful for women to know as well since the covenants women make connect and overlap with those made by the men.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HLDAGK4EBKXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629720305#wasThisHelpful","R1HLDAGK4EBKXR","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The Octopus Scientists is no different.

The author also includes several sidebars with extra information about the scientists as well as octopuses in general.  I was fascinated to learn that what I've always thought of as the octupus 'head' is really more of a torso.

"I quite enjoyed this early reader not only for the cute dogs, but for the sweet message about being a hero and the value of patience and a listening ear.  Sparky is thrilled when he receives a requested K-9 hat, badge and collar for his birthday and he immediately sets out to become a hero.  But he can't seem to find anything heroic to do, no mean cats to defeat and no bone robbers to catch.  But when he hears Tidbit, a young dog, crying he can't help but respond.  It turns out though that all Tidbit needs is help with his reading and this discourages Sparky.  His compassionate heart though can't help but melt at the young dog's discouragement and so he sits and listens as Tidbit stumbles through his book.  Not only is this a book about a different kind of hero, but the value of persistence.  A cute book with a great message for young readers who are finding learning to read a difficult prospect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E8SGIGET40M1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481404245#wasThisHelpful","R1E8SGIGET40M1","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"50 Things You Should Know About the First World War is divided into fifty sections, each examining one aspect of the war, either a key event or a key aspect of the war.  Some of the topics covered are trench warfare, poison gas, A Christmas Truce, England under attack, assassination of Franz Ferdinand and many others. This is the sort of book that I would hand to a reluctant reader who wants to learn more about the war but doesn't want a big, long, text-heavy book.  Each section is 1-2 pages and is made up of photographs, diagrams, and short explanatory paragraphs giving details about the topic.  For such a brief book (80 pages, including a glossary and a who's who of important historical figures), it covers all the major aspects of the war, including a look at related events.  However, for a reader who is looking for more details this general coverage may not be entirely satisfying, but it makes for a great starting point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VUC9Y1AJ2VQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609926307#wasThisHelpful","R1VUC9Y1AJ2VQJ","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this book.  Read it in two sittings as a matter of fact.  I confess to having a soft spot in my heart for books with young children in them and the three in this book are adorable.  A handful, but adorable nonetheless.  From the first chapter I was pulled into the lives of Callum and Iris who've found a way to make the best of their lives despite some real heartache in their lives.  It was clear from the beginning that feelings remained between the two, but some secrets stood in the way.  But when Iris's dad does his best to drive Callum away a second time, Iris has to decide what she's willing to do for love.  I enjoyed the scenes with Callum, Iris, and the boys interacting especially well.  Secondhand Cowboy is a sweet, Christian romance about forgiveness and love and coming home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OVJZXPEYT01I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THMNCW0#wasThisHelpful","R2OVJZXPEYT01I","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The conclusion to the Cragbridge Hall trilogy is full of twists and turns and plenty of excitement.  Abby and Derick and their friends are once again up against Charles Muns who is determined to use the Bridge (a time travel device) to control the world.  After receiving a message from the future that shakes them up, Abby and Derick are forced to face off with Muns without the aide of their parents and grandfather.  It all seems to revolve around the Race that the school sponsors every year.  After recruiting as many of the best students as they can, the team must win the Race in hopes of stopping Muns once and for all.  Once again, Chad Morris takes readers on a thrill ride as we follow the twins through their adventures.I loved the technology that Morris has created.  The ability to use virtual reality to be a falcon for instance would be fantastic, especially for those like me who tend to be a bit klutzy.  I also really appreciated that the possible consequences of changing the past are explored along with the ramifications of the desires of one person overpowering the good of the whole.

"Uma wants more than anything to be an Adan (healer) like her father.  But her half-English, half-Euit ancestry and the fact that she is female stand as major obstacles to her dream.  After she and her father are abducted and taken to the Pendragon castle to help the queen conceive a child, everything changes.  Soon, Uma is on her own desperately trying to find a way to survive and free her people from captivity.  When she meets Jackrun, the king's nephew, she finds someone she can trust and perhaps even love, if she allows herself to be a woman rather than just a healer.  But when the king's son is murdered she struggles to define herself and find a way to save herself from the plots that swirl around her.I haven't read the first two books in this series and I think it would have helped if I had, but the author does a good job of introducing enough of the culture and beliefs that I wasn't too lost.  I just had a feeling that knowing what had happened before would have made the story that much easier to follow.  I did enjoy the book though, for such a long book, the plot moves quickly as Uma faces various challenges and crises.  I think the parts I enjoyed the most though were her interactions with Jackrun.  Jackrun is my favorite kind of hero, a courageous and kind person who struggles with his own identity as the Son of the Prophecy, including a unique talent that he's very self-conscious about.  Jackrun and Uma connect I think because they both are still figuring out who they are and what they really want.  That theme unlies the whole story but is overshadowed by the political intrigue and betrayal.  An enjoyable read for YA fantasy lovers everywhere.Note: this is definitely a YA fantasy because it includes an attempted rape, a bit of language, and sexual references (not graphic) as well as some violence (torture, hanging, burning, etc.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z43OL6VI563/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803738102#wasThisHelpful","R1Z43OL6VI563","A30A8GG1O5CFQ2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30A8GG1O5CFQ2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are few things more valued in a home office setting than desktop real estate. The space-hungry computers, keyboards, smartphones and devices all require room to operate. And that’s why I appreciate this DBPOWER dimmable desk lamp so much. It occupies very little space – a tad over a 5.31-inch square. Its adjustable gooseneck design allows me to shine light on a specific area or cover my entire desk with light. I can place it out of the way, on the far corner of my desk, and it illuminates everything within my reach. I’m most impressed, however, with this lamp’s available levels of LED brightness. It’s a full spectrum, from soft white light accent level to Broadway. Some of the energy efficient bulbs I use in my home office produce a yellowish light that’s good for the environment, but not great for reading or detail work. This lamp allows me the option of using bright white light when necessary.  This sleek black lamp is well made and competitively priced. It comes with a power adapter and intuitive instructions. Highly recommended.

"In the 1950’s my dad didn’t wash his Buicks with a garden hose. Instead, he had an automatic car washer… ME. So with decades of experience I’m very familiar with garden hose accessories. Clearly this Coolife device is not my father’s garden hose nozzle. It is an ergonomically designed, precisely built tool that operates easily and efficiently without compromise. These days I use a water hose to clean my driveway, patio and deck. So I need a nozzle that allows for the powerful burst of water required to clean off dirt and debris. But I also use my hose to wash my classic convertible. I need the option of a softer distribution of water for the delicate task of rinsing off soap without damaging the finish of my car. For that I use the Shower, Soaker and Cone settings. The Mist setting works well on the cloth convertible top. And for a strong stream of water to clean brake dust from the wheels, I use the Jet and Flat settings. The Coolife Nozzle is one of the most versatile tools on the market. Highly recommended.

"I like to grill during summer and roast during the holidays. And I’ve found that there’s no substitute for a good thermometer to ensure meats are not overcooked. When I’m grilling boneless, skinless chicken breasts, for example, I use this digital thermometer to pull the meat off the grill at 164-degrees. Knowing that chicken is done at 165-degrees, I understand that the meat will continue to cook off the grill, and the extra time gives the meat time to rest and redistribute its juices. The JMR Digital Wireless Thermometer is accurate and easy to use, both on the BBQ grill and in the oven. The device’s stainless steel probe and heat-resistant 3-foot cable facilitates measuring temps from my counter top. The internal temperature is displayed on an LED backlit screen in Fahrenheit or Celsius, making it easy to read day or night, indoors or outdoors. I like having the built-in alarm to let me know when the desired temperature, or cooking time, has been reached. This will be especially useful when roasting a turkey next Thanksgiving.This is easily the most versatile digital thermometer I’ve ever used. With presets for several different kinds of meat, and options for levels of doneness, this device makes it easy to customize servings for individual preferences. With a 65-foot wireless range, I‘m happy not to be tied down to the BBQ grill. Also nothing beats a manufacturer that backs its product with a lifetime warranty. But as much as I like this device, I do have a minor issue. It requires four AAA batteries, which are not included in the box.

"As a New York pizza lover living in the South, the Teikis Pizza Tool Set is not only useful it’s essential. My homemade pizzas are baked on a large pizza stone that produces a crisp thin crust that’s hot-hot-hot. And while I prepare my pizza on a large wooden peel, the Teikis stainless steel peel slides easily beneath the crust for removal from the oven. This peel is strong enough to hold a pizza with the myriad of toppings they use in the south, or the NY holy grail of “plain” pizza. I like the offset design of the handle, which folds away for storage. And the 14” pizza cutter allows me to cut my pizza professionally and efficiently, because I can apply more cutting pressure with two hands. After several uses I can re-sharpen the cutter using my knife sharpener, which is hard to do with a pizza wheel-type cutter. Included in this set is a blade cover for safety. Teikis seems to have thought of everything. Both tools clean up easily with a damp cloth, but before the first use I would suggest using soaping water to thoroughly remove all protective oils from the stainless just as you would for a new wok.

"Viva Labs Magnesium tablets are what I needed to maintain a healthy body. At 68, I take a considerable number of pills each day to help me deal with diabetes and hypertension.

"In recent years I’ve become increasingly interested in physical fitness and better monitoring of the food I eat. The DBPOWER Digital Kitchen Scale is a new tool that I use daily to measure the weight of fruit and vegetables for smoothies and light snacks. Sleek, black tempered glass with a low profile, this scale is attractive enough to keep on my minimalist counter top. Unlike several power hungry scales on the market requiring multiple AAA batteries, the DBPOWER scale requires merely one single CR2032 button type battery. Tare functionality allows me to subtract the weight of the container for a more accurate reading. And the auto-off feature extends the life of the battery. I also like the fact that this scale measures in universally accepted units like grams, kilograms, lbs-oz, and ounces. For liquids it measures units in cups, as well as milliliters. It has a whopping 11-pound/5kg weight capacity, which comes in handy when weighing small packages to estimate postage costs. Of course, even the best looking, highest weight capacity scale would be useless if it weren’t accurate.

"In a kitchen utensil market that’s flooded with salt & pepper grinders, this easy to hold hourglass ceramic grinder stands out at the top of the heap. It’s made of acrylic and brushed stainless steel - durable enough to withstand daily, full-family use, yet gorgeous enough to be the star of my counter top. And when it comes to gadgets and appliances on my kitchen counter top, I’m a minimalist. But this sleek looking grinder only occupies 49mm – less than 2 inches - of space. So it makes a flawless transition from counter to tabletop. And it works even better than it looks.While my cooking ingredients usually include kosher salt, my tabletop grinder is invariably loaded with coarse sea salt for its rich flavor-enhancing properties. I stock the pepper side with the finest black tellicherry peppercorns. And this is why the deluxe hourglass salt and pepper grinder is so impressive. Its precise ceramic grinding mechanism gives me the option of selecting the size of the granules of salt and pepper.  And while it’s true that any grinder worth its salt (or pepper) will allow you to select granule size, very few are as accurate as this one. Maybe it’s just me, but I find the end caps included with this grinder bothersome. I’m a guy; I’m not fussy. I want to reach for a grinder that works right off the counter and use it without having to prepare it for use. The good news is that the grinder mechanism works so well that I don’t even need the end caps, because I haven’t found the usual leakage found in similar grinders of lesser quality. A sample product was provided for this evaluation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22VCHNYRVH4PQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZEUIP4#wasThisHelpful","R22VCHNYRVH4PQ","A2Y1WSEDSXTYU6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y1WSEDSXTYU6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There’s nothing new about iPhone battery cases, but I’ve found that they are not all created equal. Some boast a lot of power, while others add too much weight and girth to the svelte profile of iPhone 6. Of course, the best Apple-certified battery cases have found a sweet spot in the power-to-weight ratio. The new Powercase3000 by Macally offers substantial power, wrapped in a sleek, slim, sultry black case. The case’s smooth rubberized matte coating makes it easy to hold on to and more comfortable in my hand. This battery case may not be the most powerful on the market, but it doesn’t bulk up my iPhone with the size and weight of a larger battery. So I now have an extra 9 hours of talk time in my pocket with a minimum of added size and weight. But that’s not all.The Powercase3000 features an automatic shut-off when my iPhone 6 is fully charged, which saves battery power. These days, when everything is “smart,” smart charging makes a lot of sense. There have been many improvements in the design of battery cases over the past few years, and Macally seems to have taken advantage of each advancement. Some battery cases are rigid, making the iPhone difficult to insert and almost impossible to remove. But the Powercase3000 is flexible and my iPhone 6 slips into it easily and snugly. I really love this battery case; it’s one of the best I’ve tried. But given the number of quality battery cases out there, this one may be a tad over-priced at $70.

"Six months ago I reviewed the Virilem Fingernail clipper, and I couldn’t hide my enthusiasm:“Nail clippers? Really? My immediate reaction when approached to review this product was a huh-moment. One would be hard pressed to find a junk drawer in America that doesn’t hold at least one dime store nail clipper. So I didn’t think there was anything a manufacturer could do to improve upon something so basic in male grooming. Wrong! These aren’t the same cute little chrome clippers; they’re turbo-charged. I’m talking strong, durable stainless steel, and precision sharp at the business end.As a single guy, a million years ago, I learned that first impressions go a long way when meeting women. They are very detail oriented, and a man’s fingernails are a visual calling card that can be more impressive than a platinum bankcard. Virilem Nail Clippers are well made and very sharp - sharp enough to also do a great job on toenails. But clear the room, because those thick toenail clippings can be semi-dangerous projected missiles.While this device looks like most other nail clippers, once you hold it in your hand, the difference is clear. It has the feel of a real tool. Virilem has designed and manufactured a high quality clipper that precisely cuts nails. But there’s more! The rounded edge of the clipper’s lever is perfect for pushing back cuticles to facilitate uniform nail growth. So it’s a complete nail grooming station in one little device. A lifetime or 30-day money back guarantee tells me that Virilem Nail Clippers For Men has set a new gold standard for the well-groomed male.”Virilem has done it again! With the packaging a fingernail clipper and a toenail clipper, Virilem now offers a complete nail grooming solution. There are growing concerns about the sanitary conditions of some local nail salons. So I opted to do my own nails. This quality set simplifies the task for trimming both my fingernails and toenails.

"I’ve auditioned several sports-type Bluetooth headsets. They interest me because I use them when I’m exercising and power walking. Connected via Bluetooth to my iPhone 6, a great sports headset is worth its weight in gold. Some Bluetooth headsets are better than others. Some are much better than others. DBPOWER BE-900 is impressive in its stealth styling, comfort and design. It features 5 hours of music listening time and 6 hours of phone talking time. But I don’t expect I’ll ever need its 60-hour standby time. This headset also features quality sound, including solid bass and crisp treble. I suspect that the slightly thicker, shorter cable may have something to do with the better sound quality. The controls work just fine, and the set uses “Intelligent Voice” to answer and end phone calls. The only knock I can find on this product is in its wireless tech. The latest Bluetooth technology on the market is version 4.1, and DBPOWER BE-900 features Bluetooth v4.0, which is, essentially, 2010 tech. However, it’s not a game changer. Since iPhone 6 uses Bluetooth v4.0, I won’t give the DBPOWER BE-900 a low rating. It’s an excellent, well-designed headset.

"There are several good sports headsets on the market today, but this headset seems to have avoided all the pitfalls of most them. The Blackzebra Bluetooth 4.1 uses all the advancements in wireless technology without scrimping on sound quality or comfort. My litmus test for headsets begins and ends with musicality. Poor bass frequency response will expose a trifling headset every time. The Blackzebra features snug fitting earbuds, and that alone helps accentuate the bass and midrange. The highs are crisp as a bell without straining. As for comfort and stability, this adjustable headset fits well on my ears as well as in my ears, and they are never on the verge of falling out no matter how rigorous the activity. The cable is strong and secure, and the controls are very responsive. Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity is flawless, and transmission range extends to an impressive 66 feet. This headset is good for 5 hours after a full charge, and it is capable of pairing with two different devices at the same time. The controls of the Blackzebra hang on the cable, with the microphone positioned perfectly for voice transmission. A simple push of a button answers the phone. A single click of the same button ends the call. I like this headset a lot. A User’s Manual, USB charging cable, and 4 extra earbuds are included.

"As an author, I’m in the habit of jotting ideas down for future reference, because some ideas are fleeting, never again to return. So when I was given the opportunity to review the iGearPro USB Voice Recorder I was happy to accept. This bad boy records up to 13 hours on a single recharge of its lithium battery. The Instruction Manual is clear and concise, with an easily readable font. Operation of the recorder is a simple, one-button process. The added bonus is the 8 GB USB file transfer capability. Mac users will need to download a special free Application from the Internet, which will facilitate playing the recorded WAV files on your Mac.

"As a flight attendant my wife travels a lot. During her down time in various cities she often plays the role of tourist. This Winkine canvas tote bag fills all her travel requirements - being lightweight, easy to pack and casual/versatile to compliment any outfit. It’s big enough to carry pop-decision souvenirs or an impromptu lunch. She likes the style and detail work of the bag. The heavy-duty zipper, buckles, riveting and double stitching give it a rugged shabby-chic appeal suited to jeans and sandals. It’s large and heavy, but not oversized for a tote bag. The great thing is that she doesn’t feel the need to coddle it, like her designer bags. She really likes this canvas tote bag, and I think she looks sensational with it.

I particularly like the way GMYLE provided for easier access to the triple bank of buttons on the left side instead of two cutouts like other skins and cases. Also the entire top and bottom edges are cutout for better access in charging and speakers, as well as the antenna for Apple Pay reception. I’ve tried to find flaws in the impeccable black marble finish but I can’t. It looks great and feels smooth to the touch. It’s a fingerprint magnet, of course, as is the iPhone display itself.

"I’d be the first to admit that I’m no skin care specialist, but after including Ellie’s Best Fractionated Coconut Oil in my daily routine, I’ve begun to notice remarkable differences. I use the product for skin care and hair care. But I’m most impressed by its performance in shaving prep. Applied to my face prior to shaving it seems to be absorbed quickly by my skin, and I top it off with my favorite shaving cream for a smoother shave. After shaving, a small drop of the oil soothes my skin and further restores it. I also apply it to my hair after showering. Fragrance-free and non-greasy, it leaves my skin and hair extremely touchable.This product was produced in Indonesia, and bottled in China to meet obviously stringent quality standards. So I continue to use Ellie’s Best with confidence. Highly recommended for both men and women.

"Keyboard cover design has come a long way since the clumsy, thick covers of the 1990’s. This keyboard skin perfectly fits my Mac Bluetooth keyboard, as well as my 15” MacBook Pro Retina. Given my past experience with old covers I was a bit skeptical about how effective this cover would be. But this skin is so thin and flexible that it doesn’t dampen key touch or undermine my keyboard’s response sensitivity. The GMYLE OS X Shortcut Keyboard Cover is a great Mac accessory. I never before realized that there are so many built-in OS X shortcuts on the keyboard, but this skin helps me take advantage of every shortcut without taking a class. And while this skin looks and feels very delicate, it’s durable enough to withstand maintenance and cleaning. So accidental spills, crumbs and dust are no longer a problem for my MacBook Pro keyboard no matter where I’m using it.

The kit includes every possible attachment for the trimming of every hair on the body – head, beard, ear, nose, and even the unmentionable areas.

I’m just hoping that the trimmer production has been upgraded and improved to the extent that this model is now worthy of the 5-star rating I’m giving it.

"When life hands you a lemon, first you squeeze it… and then you make lemonade. The Kitchen Frontier Lemon Squeezer makes quick work of turning a whole lemon into pure, seedless juice. It has 12 holes in its recessed bowl as compared to 7 holes in most popular squeezers. Of course, the secret of making perfect lemonade lies in harnessing the lemon oil from the skin. No lemon squeezer can extract that oil, but immersing the squeezed lemons into a large pitcher of water for a couple of hours will effectively flavor the water with a more intense lemon fragrance. Add a teaspoon of pure honey, along with granulated sugar to taste, and you have old fashion country style lemonade. But it all begins with a great lemon squeezer. This one is the perfect size and weight for a kitchen hand tool. The handles are longer than they appear to be in the photos, which means better leverage for a better squeeze. It is constructed of the same heavy-duty stainless steel found in pro kitchens, and will last for generations of family cooks. Since it’s not painted, I won’t be concerned about a chipped paint surprise, as the squeezer gets older. Full disclosure, this product was made in China. Many lemon squeezers on the market these days are painted yellow – aesthetically pleasing, but raising all kinds of health concerns about possible lead paint in cheap kitchen tools made in other countries. Stainless steel, however, cleans up nicely in my dishwasher.A sample product was provided for this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30QA3ELNCG3X0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KIC4DF8#wasThisHelpful","R30QA3ELNCG3X0","A2Y1WSEDSXTYU6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y1WSEDSXTYU6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lately Bluetooth earbuds seem to be falling from the sky. But some hit the ground with a thud. With so many out there, it can be difficult to distinguish a contender from a pretender without side-by-side comparisons. The Soundpeats Qy7 V4.1 brings quality sound across all frequencies, with solid bass, precise treble and uniform midrange. I’ve found that certain recordings bring out the best, or the worst, in a speaker, headphone or earbud. For earbuds the challenge lies in reproducing deep bass. The better the earbud seals in the ear canal, the better the bass response. Soundpeats meets the design challenge by enclosing a variety of earbud sizes in the box. I was able to custom fit this product to my ear canal and discover that sweet spot combination of great sound and ultimate comfort. Right out of the box, Bluetooth pairing with my iPhone 6 was seamless, and the featherweight connecting cable is so light that I sometimes forget that I’m wearing the earbuds.The set has a microphone for smartphone communication, but its location on the earpiece (on the ear) sometimes hampers the mic, particularly outdoors.

However, caution should be exercised, because this truck has small parts that can be dangerous for kids under 3 years old.

"Let’s face it, there are many brands of Omega 3 Fish Oil on the market, so you research as much as you can to find the best. PCNL is a brand that I trust, because of their quality CoQ10 softgels. I was happy to discover their Omega 3 Fish Oil Platinum. Understanding the benefits of this product, especially when added to a sensible diet and regular exercise routine, I take two softgels daily with meals. I can’t say that I completely understand all the benefits of this supplement. But at age 67 I’m happily living with more energy and less joint pain. I used to wear one of those compression knee braces when I exercised, because of periodic, excruciating knee pain. I no longer need the knee brace, because the pain is gone. I’m not saying that PCNL Omega 3 Fish Oil cured me. But I’m not saying that it didn’t, either. All I know is that I feel better. A sample product was provided for this review.

"I had always wondered about the value of a dashboard car camera. And then, a few years ago, I experienced an auto accident, when a moving truck turned into my car. Once the insurance lawyers got involved, it was reduced to a he said/he said case, with no undisputable evidence on either side. What I would have given for a dash cam then. The SecurityMan Car Camera is just what I was looking for, with its simple setup, ease of operation, high-def recording, and wide-angle lens. This car cam is an affordable alternative to the overpriced, feature-laden models on the market, and it does the job. In fact, the only thing missing from this package is a micro SD card, and I prefer it that way, because it allows me to choose my preferred brand.There is much to like here. The appropriately named Securityman camera easily detaches from its windshield bracket, allowing me to hide it in the glove compartment when I’m away from my car. It also features an auto, motion detection, or manual recording option. The windshield suction mount is firm and secure. Granted, this is not SecurityMan’s highest-grade dash camera, but it offers many of the same features as the higher priced models, and it’s a great introduction to dashcam technology. It offers continuous loop recording at 1080p resolution. It records 30-second, 3-minute, or 5-minute continuous video clips. Also there’s an Infrared LED array for improved nighttime recording. Dashcams available north of $300 may offer larger screens, but the SecurityMan’s 1.5” screen is all I need with high definition. After all, this is for viewing collision video not Dr. Zhivago. Highly recommended.

"We are part of an exclusive club, those of us that own cars.  At some point we’re all gonna have to replace automobile light bulbs. Modern car light bulbs last longer, but the great news is that newer LED bulbs can be retrofitted to older cars. My old car used tungsten bulbs, so I was happy to discover the Yorkim 194 LED bulbs replace the old T10 Wedge type tungsten bulbs. This new technology offers so much more than traditional bulbs. 300% brighter/whiter, 1,000 times faster, with a lifespan that trumps 50,000 hours, the Yorkim 194s can replace all the cute little interior bulbs such as dome, courtesy, trunk, etc. They work for license plate lighting. These bulbs also work for lighting on motorcycles, truck, RVs and boats. And with the price of LEDs getting lower, I can see myself replacing each and every tungsten bulb with Yorkim 194 LEDs. They run longer, cooler and brighter. For me, that’s the bottom line. Highly recommended.

"I’m one of those people that don’t understand the need to camouflage anything outside of a war zone. But this Eltronica Lantern (Made in China) brings all the necessary camping specs – including a compass. It could fulfill anyone’s Grizzly Adams fantasy, but it also works for the rest of us. I know it will make an essential emergency lamp if my electrical power shuts down during a storm.  With LEDs putting out a super bright 120 Lumens, the Camo Lantern can also be used as an emergency light to be carried in my car trunk. At 5.5 inches – expanding to 12 - this bad boy is easily added to backpack, glove box or picnic basket, so you don’t need a deer’s head on your den wall to fully appreciate this device. Three AA batteries (not included) power the Camo Lantern, and the LED technology allow for a projected 100,000-hour lifespan. Road-tested. Since it was designed for the outdoors, I took it outdoors (in my backyard) and tossed it around on the grass. The ruggedly lightweight camouflaged lantern withstood every blow admirably. And it wasn’t even that difficult to find in the grass, because the camo is light green.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JJ0RO4SLL4ZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V97YCLQ#wasThisHelpful","R3JJ0RO4SLL4ZL","A2Y1WSEDSXTYU6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y1WSEDSXTYU6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This portable speaker surprised me. It looks small but it’s heavy for its size; the kind of heavy that an exceptional speaker needs. And then there’s the amazing sound. I heard a big booming wall of sound and I couldn’t imagine it all came from this tiny spaceship looking hockey puck. But it’s all there - deep bass, precise treble, and a well-dispersed mid-range. The sound emanates from a 360-degree wraparound speaker, and placed in the middle of a room it’s difficult to tell where the sound originates. I love all kinds of music - from Jazz to Classical, R&B, Pop and some Country. The Arespark speaker handles everything I throw at it without sonic strain.There is much to like about this speaker. But make no mistake, this is serious equipment; it’s not a toy for small children that tend to put things in their mouths. The product was made in China. That said there are many things to like about this speaker. I love the fact that the controls are right on top, easy to read and simple to operate. Bluetooth pairing with my iPhone 6 is flawless. This speaker makes a great take-along, whether in backpack, glove compartment or picnic basket, though its camouflage design may make it hard to find in the grass (wink, wink). Mostly this quality speaker is FUN. Arespark has thought of everything. The included D-shaped carabiner snap clip adds to the device’s mobility in that I can clip it on to anything… and go. It also comes with two cables – a micro USB charging cable and a 3.5mm audio cable. There’s even a slot for a micro SD card.

"The Clear Plastic Tote Bag by Lifestyle Plus is a great little carryall for sports arenas, airports and picnics. It’s made of weatherproof heavy-duty plastic, and facilitates carrying with its well-stitched straps – both hand loops and shoulder straps. Sure, the see-through feature is helpful (even mandatory) for security people at public facilities, but I find it useful to easily see what I’m carrying. Thankfully it comes with either black accents, or pink accents. There is also a neat little detachable pouch where I can comfortably carry small personal items.  I like this tote bag.

"LifeCHARGE has ushered in a new day of smartphone charging on the go with its AC wall adapter. And it doesn’t matter what smartphone technology you use. The Source 101mAh Powerbank is equipped with dual microports and a USB port to make it a universal charging station. So at 5100mAh, this is not the most powerful external battery on the market, but it just may be the most versatile. The approximate dimensions of this unit are 3”x2.5”x1” thick and it weighs a relatively light 6.4 ounces, so it packs well in carry-on luggage or a picnic basket. The sleek, compact design of the Source makes it a device that I don’t hesitate to carry with me as a mobile charger. The multi-LED battery indicator keeps me informed of remaining power. The pack does not include Apple cables, but it makes a great gift for multi-device, multi-smartphone tech families. Highly recommended.

"I’ve been searching for the ultimate iPhone 6 case since I purchased my iPhone on launch day. I admit to being a case snob, preferring a case that doesn’t compromise the thin profile that Apple designed. But I also want a case that offers some degree of protection in the event of a minor drop. The Protekme case combines style, functionality and protection at an affordable price. For those who like their iPhone well protected the Protekme offers 360-degree, 2-piece armor. But those of us that want our iPhone to remain uncovered and immediately available for action or viewing, prefer a case less encumbered. In other words, this case is more case than I need. Much of the beauty of the iPhone 6 is its screen. Why cover it up? I’m sure others will find it adequate for their iPhone 6. Also, in theory, the kickstand is a nice idea, and it works in the landscape position. But in the portrait position this case does not stand up. It falls backwards and does not balance – either with the iPhone 6 attached, or by itself. Also I’m not sure I’d want to carry my iPhone 6 clipped to my belt. The belt clip reminds me of a pager… 30 years ago. Besides, I’m not inclined to secure a $300 iPhone with a $13 belt clip.  This case may satisfy some. It has a great price, but you get what you pay for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J5NL1577DQY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RPUS9GA#wasThisHelpful","R3J5NL1577DQY4","A2Y1WSEDSXTYU6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y1WSEDSXTYU6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in the 1970’s my favorite headphones was an inexpensive, lightweight, yellow foam-padded headset that sounded terrific. In the current market of popular $300 headphones this SoundPEATS headset comes as a big surprise, both price-wise and sonically. With good quality, Bluetooth connectivity and a built-in microphone, this headset satisfies on many levels. I don't think it competes well with expensive headphones, but it's a good set for casual listening. The SoundPEATS features the deep bass - which is a little boomy for my tastes - and crisp highs of the higher priced headphones, and their lightweight makes them comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The sound sometimes breaks up, which can be annoying. Bluetooth-paired to my iPhone I’m never worried that I’ll miss a phone call, because the well-placed controls allow me to switch from music to phone with the click of a button. This headset would make a great gift for a student, but it’s a gift that you may want to keep for yourself.

"I like kitchen tools and gadgets, but I love those that really work as designed. The HappierChef Apple Slicer and Corer is the best one I have tried. I’ve used others made of flimsy plastic and cheap metal, but this one is relatively heavy stainless steel. It feels like a tool used by professional chefs. The stainless steel blades slice easily through the apple skin, and the heft of this slicer ensures that the apple core will break away flawlessly. There are no jagged edges to cling onto bits of fruit. The non-slip rubberized handles feel great in the hands. I have no doubt that this slicer will clean up nicely in the dishwasher.

"When you become familiar with quality cable you recognize the FRiEQ brand name. MFi certified and compatible with Apple devices, this cable works with most wall adapters in charging my devices. All lightning-to-USB cables are not created equal, and the difference can be found specifically in flexibility and strength. The length (3.3 feet) of the FRiEQ cable will accommodate charging my devices from the backseat of my car, and synching my iPods and iPhone with iTunes on the back of my iMac. The cable is reinforced at both ends and, like all FRiEQ cables its kink-free thickness ensures that electronic interference during data transfer is a non-issue.

"For anyone either new to Microsoft Office or new to the features of the Office 2013 edition this reasonably priced book and online video series presents clear instruction in all the basic and general procedures necessary to use Office 2013.  I have only deducted one star because this book/video combination covers only the basic and generic feature, and because the video instruction is not accessible on the same screen as one's practice session with Office.  While all basic menu features, ribbon, and formatting commands are covered in sufficient depth, the instruction is not sufficiently deep to allow a subject matter expert to use and carry out advanced operations with the software.  For example, even one quite knowledgeable in basic statistics or financial operation would not be able on the basis of this book and video series to construct an Excel spreadsheet using linear regression, or calculating risk and the time value of money.  Likewise, I would not attempt to author a scientific article or thesis in Word merely on the basis of this instruction.But,, for anyone seeking to learn the basic feature of Office 2013 and its differences from prior editions the instruction is a bargain and more than adequate to thee purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LXMLNEZZXEQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118490320#wasThisHelpful","R3LXMLNEZZXEQY","A15PV8J0IYVDNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15PV8J0IYVDNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Phil Simon is a prominent speaker and writer on business trends particularly those involving ""Big Data"".  He presents this beautiful full color volume as a set of Case Studies on how organizations ranging from the multibillion dollar Netflix, to the small yet innovative start-up Social Polling organization Wedgies benefit from the use of innovative data visualization of Big Data to their corporate advantage.  He states he is ot redoing the greats of data visualization strategy like Tufte, or concentrating on the detailed heuristics of a bar chart versus a pie diagram.  Thus I was not as surprised to see that while he mentioned big data tools like R he did not concentrate on their best use in Visualization. After all this is a book of Case Studies.  But I noticed that all of the successful visualizations he illustrated took significant steps in planning how people use their cognition (decision making skills) and emotions in making a decision or reaching conclusions about big data. Mr. Simon might have offered some advice on how an organization should proceed in making cognitive and emotional impact with their presentations.This is a fine effort in describing the Impact of Data Visualizations of Big Data have on Organizational Success.

"This is an excellent business decision making and consulting guide, which relies on a combination of statistical and behavioral measures. It is particularly applicable to decisions involving risk, valuation, and the value of information.  It is not as is stated in the first half of the title a guide to ""Measuring Anything""; for example little insight is provided that would be applicable to measurement of physical quantities, or rates and bottlenecks in a factory.  Some methods discussed while insightful involve non-standard definitions of quantities.  For example a behavioral measure of correctness based on knowledge sufficiency tests is given as an example of Confidence Intervals, rather than the conventional definition of Interval Estimates in a Normal Probability Distribution.I highly recommend this text as an addition to the Internal or External Consultant's library.

His piquant analysis is based on considerable expertise in the political, social and economic (financial) spheres.

Certainly more and higher quality products can be expected from China's manufacturing prowess (as I have seen in the electronics market and semiconductor industries).

"Did I enjoy this book: I really did. This was a fantastic read that had me glued to my Kindle from beginning to the end.Annabel is a working mom of two adorable children, and she has a wonderful husband. They are living a pretty good life. The major snag in Annabel’s seemingly perfect life is her mother, Bea. Bea is very opinionated, rather stubborn, and sometimes just a bitch. Annabel just wants her mother to show that she loves her and her children. However, there is way more to this story than what meets the eye.I can’t go into too much about the story itself or the arcs of the characters for fear of giving away some major plot lines. I will say this: Plan Bea is a great example of the fact that everyone . . . everyone . . . has a story, a history. Nobody’s life is easy or perfect as they may lead you to believe. Ms. Grossman does a great job getting you to like all the characters, down to the kids, and she even has a few surprises up her sleeve. I didn’t see them coming. There was a bit of a cliffhanger. Bit isn’t quite the right word . . . When will the next book be out?!?!?!?!? I can’t wait. (Please don’t get me wrong, the cliffhanger does not in any way spoil the book for me. It just makes you want to read more.)All in all, Plan Bea was a great read. You’ll laugh, cry, hope, wonder, shake your head, and gasp. At least, those were a few of the reactions I had.Would I recommend it: Absolutely! Any chick lit or women’s fiction lover should read Plan Bea.Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange  for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHM4093TD5TV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016E6FS4G#wasThisHelpful","RHM4093TD5TV0","A3THLI10635V4V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3THLI10635V4V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 starsDid I enjoy this book: I really did! I loved Surviving the Rachel.Bree is young and trying to find her footing after an unexpected start post-college. After moving home, she finds a friend in her neighbor, Jack.  I love their chemistry. They make great friends, and more.  There were a few times that I wanted to smack each of them and ask them what they were thinking, or why didn’t they ask the other one very pertinent questions! It was a good frustration. I was invested in their stories, in their lives. I loved watching Bree come into her own in her new profession.On top of that, there were quite a few swoon-worthy moments, giddy moments, sweet moments. And fireflies! And the end! Wonderful.Another aspect of Ms. Ellis’s books that I really like is that they are all connected in some way. They all use Connectivity. Avery and Deke from Chronicles of a Lincoln Park Fashionista show up in Surviving the Rachel. You feel like you are in the same community. These aren’t sequels or books in the same setting/series. But they all fit together. Oh, and the Friends references were perfect! It is one of my favorite TV series of all time. I’ll say it again: wonderful.Would I recommend it: Absolutely!

"Did I enjoy this book: I really liked this book. Secrets of the Porch made me think about faith, forgiveness, and love. I think one of the biggest themes is love. Yes, there’s romantic love, but there’s also a love for family and friends, love for God, and finding a way to love yourself. My favorite character is Lila. She is a strong woman with love running through her veins, and she has many layers. I think she made the book for me.The only thing I don’t love about the book is how quickly the dramatic event happen toward the end. The whole thing seems to be thrown into the book to draw out something dark, but it seems out of place and out of character. The only thing I can think of is that maybe Sellon was hoping to use the event in order to add an emotional punch to Lila’s story.

I left the kids up in their cribs an extra ten minutes after naptime just so I could finish a chapter. Yeah, it was good.To Ride a White Horse is what a historical romance should be. It has plenty of kissing, longing, passion, and of course, well-placed historical elements. The history doesn’t take a backseat. Ford does a great job describing the Irish famine for those who aren’t familiar with it. I’d heard some things in history class, but Kathleen (the leading lady) and her family really made it real for me. I felt what they were feeling and actually cared what happened to her family.

"3.5 starsDid I enjoy this book: Alexander was a staple of my own childhood, so I was eager to share him with my own children. My son loves it just as much as I did as a child. The best aspect of Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day is that it demonstrates that you don’t always get your way and sometimes (even in Australia) you have a bad day. I feel this is a lesson that many children today are lacking.The illustrations are black and white and could be a little more engaging, but my toddler doesn’t seem to mind all that much. One of the things that bothers me from a parenting perspective is that Alexander uses the word “hate” quite a lot. As a parent, I try to encourage my children to express themselves without using negative labeling words like “hate” and “can’t.” It’s okay not to like something, but I would rather my children explain what they don’t like instead of just applying a label. That being said, I still read this to my children frequently. We talk about better ways for Alexander to express his feelings about things that he doesn’t like, so it all works out to be a teaching moment.Would I recommend it: This is a fun book that I enjoy reading to my children, and I would recommend it to parents who are looking for an entertaining story with a useful lesson.As reviewed by Sara at Every Free Chance Books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P66JPWUJOTD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689711735#wasThisHelpful","R1P66JPWUJOTD8","A3THLI10635V4V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3THLI10635V4V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Did I enjoy this book: The first aspect of the book that struck me was the characters. They are well developed and multi-dimensional. Quality characters are a must for me, and Mythos does not disappoint. I was immediately drawn to Itzy–she has just enough “every girl” to relate to a wide range of readers while still having plenty of mystery to keep us interested.The plot was engaging and kept me wanting more up to the end. I have to admit I was a little worried when I discovered there were “aliens” (there are so many ways to go wrong with aliens), but it was very well done. I am also a lover of all sorts of mythology, so I really enjoyed that Pendred incorporated several different ancient cultures into her story.Further, I was quite impressed with how imaginative the characters’ alien powers are. The descriptions of how Itzy and the others use their mental powers are very engaging and very cool, too! The only thing that bothers me is that several of the characters have very powerful abilities. In fact they are so powerful I was left wondering why the climax even needed to occur because Aiden could have resolved the issue with a thought. This is always a risk in magical worlds, because if you give your characters amazing powers your plot has to be robust enough to support them. A tiny bit of willing suspension of disbelief got me past this though, because I love magic.Would I recommend it: I sure would!

"Where I stopped reading: I only made it through the first several pages.Why I stopped reading: I’m clearly not the target audience for this book; not only do I not have enough working knowledge of Excel to make sense of Santiago’s tips, but I was also horrified at the blatant sexism she uses to explain things. I was expecting an “Excel for dummies with a feminine twist” sort of thing, and instead I had to keep reminding myself I’m allowed to vote.

"This is a really cute shirt I. It is super soft and it's kind of delicate . The skull on the front is a screen print / decal type and carries from the picture in the add . All in all it is worth the price . This shirt fits my 6 yr old daughter as a dress and looks super cute on her :)  this shirt would fit my friend who is almost 5 ft and 98 lbs . The actual size is about an adult xxS/xS or a kids lg.  I would not suggest wearing this shirt tight due to it being rather delicate. I'm removing 1 star for the difference in the print . Because that is really the reason why I got the shirt . I do have to say I love the lace on the shoulders it does go all the way across the back and is super soft I was worried it was going to be cheep lace and stiff but nope it's really nice . It has withstood 2 washes in a full load of laundry and the dryer but if it's washed in woolite and delicately washed it would last longer I'm sure !

"I absolutely fell in love with this bracelet so I had to wear it every day I didn't take it off for a week !! I slept w/ it on showered w/ it on and even wore it while I cooked and did dishes . I really put this bracelet thru the ringer  .  Now with that being said I have to say this bracelet is top notch ! I mean it really stood up to everyday use . None of the Chrystal's broke or fell off the clasp is really strong and over all this bracelet is made extremely well !!  Now I received an amazing opportunity to review this fabulous bracelet as part of a promotion and this is my 100% honest review based solely on my experience with this beautiful bracelet . The only thing that I found to be a negative was by the clasp there did show signs of ware . Some of the silver is starting to come off . This happens to me sometimes w/ jewelry so I can not take a star off for that because i think it has to do with the ph in your skin . So I can still wears it just not day in and day out is all . This obviously will not happen to everyone and it is a high quality piece . The only reason why I even mentioned it is just in case someone else has this same issue with jewelry they will know .  I also forgot to mention how well this bracelet fit ! Most bracelets are either too big or too small . This one was like it was made just for my wrist lol although it is semi adjustable lol . I just love how you can tell how much thought went into designing this bracelet . Oh side note.. The beads are not removable . Just in case it came up .

"I am very happy that I recieved an opportunity to review this cellulite cream as part of a promotion ! This cream feels very nice on the skin :)  I do however suggest you do not put this anywhere on your face . And if you have super sensitive skin you may have an issue .  You can feel this working after you apply it  . When you apply apply and even amount to the area in a circular motion. I personally rub it in almost all the way and then let it air dry. Some people even go as far as wrapping themselves in plastic wrap for an added the fact I have not tried this but people say this helps. After applying make sure you wash your hands you wouldn't want to accidentally get anything in your eyes that would not be good. I like to put it on right after shower I feel this is the best time to put it on.  I find of the smell pleasant it's kind of mentee it smells like the spa it just has a spa like aroma which is nice. The sent does go away soon after you apply it so even if it was an issue it shouldn't be much of an issue for you.  In the pictures I included what I like to use which is a cupping set this really gets the cream into your skin and deep down where you needed to work the most not sure if I could leave a link for the cupping set but this is definitely the way to go if you want to see A huge difference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X18Y6659DE7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KD1QXA2#wasThisHelpful","R2X18Y6659DE7D","A125OOI4EC2QCF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A125OOI4EC2QCF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fantastic start my only issue is it runs small I was not able to wear it so my girlfriend helped me review this skirt.  I received this awesome skirt  as part of a promotion  in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The skirt is perfect  for an office job and is a sharp looking skirt you can wear it with a solid top blazer jacket and a nice pair of shoes and dress up for the evening and go out for drinks after work it's versatile you could easily put a T-shirt and sneakers which is more my style .  I think a skirt like this is a staple in just about any wordrobe . This would be great for a teacher or a secretary or a girls night out and still be able to wear it to church on Sunday !! It's made well and is a wash and wear type of item that is super  versatile .","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12X6W7RY1GVD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010OQ5HOI#wasThisHelpful","R12X6W7RY1GVD2","A125OOI4EC2QCF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A125OOI4EC2QCF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a great little bit goes a long way. I received this bottle in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I couldn't be happier. This listing tangerine sent is amazing.  One of the things I'm looking forward to is in the dead of winter adding it to my diffuser and making my house smell like tangerines . I think that would really help beat the winter blues !!  I'm just learning about essential oils and besides adding this one to a diffuser one of the other uses would be to make a sugar scrub with it !!!  That is sooooo easy !!!!! You just get some sugar and add a carrier oil such as  fractionated coconut oil and add a few drops of the tangerine well you can adjusted to restaurant you would like to mix it up and if you really feel like getting crazy you can get a tangerine and grate it into the mixture just a little bit mostly for effect :) this little bottle sure will go a long way . It's pretty potent . Unless you are adding it to a diffuser I strongly suggest using a carrier such as  fractionated coconut oil. I 100% recomend this essential oil . It is soooo good for sooo many things !! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FKDCBR5S1G33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ZIATDY#wasThisHelpful","R3FKDCBR5S1G33","A125OOI4EC2QCF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A125OOI4EC2QCF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My friend is having a baby and these were a god send for me :) mine weren't as nice tho :) but my husband stole them because he actually was looking for something just like this for work lol . So they can be used for different things just not on the stroller :) he was on a ladder painting and said he needed a hook so he didn't have to go up and down the ladder every time he needed paint it just hooked onto the ladder so he just needed to move the ladder :)  he said the worked out just great :) lol he said he will get a lot of use out of them lol .

"I love these tattoos !! They are great for the summer or all year round if you live in a tropical climate :) they really can dress up an outfit :) my 6 yr old loves them :) I will update with pics soon :) we recieved these temporary tattoos as part of a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review . They are easy to open once you open them you just cut out the one you would like and peal the plastic off and place it on the part of your  body you would like the tattoo to be then just place a pretty damp /wet paper towel or cloth on top for a few min and after about a min you can check the corner to see if it's ready !! The wetter the cloth the faster the tatto will stick :) and the tattoo will last you usually a few days  unless of course it's on your hand and you're constantly washing your hands cause then of course it call probably only last a day . .

I was excited to Receive an opportunity to review this as part of a promotion :) when you take this supplement it helps you feel full and it also assists in weight loss when you take it as suggested .

The healthier you eat the better results you have . but it is not necessary . Also if you exercise you will have the best results !! Another important thing to remember when using any Garcinia Cambogia is DO NOT CONSTANTLY WEIGH YOURSELF !! you will lose inches not so much weight . I know that may not make sense but you will burn fat and gain muscle and muscle weighs more than fat . wright down you measurements  when you first start taking it and then measure again at the end you will be surprised . throw out your scale and if you take it as suggested and somewhat change your diet . along with a small amount of exercise you will not be disappointed make sure you order 2 bottles !! .  this has been my Honest and unbiased opinion based on my experience with this product :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RZGBMY514ZV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XTFEAZO#wasThisHelpful","R3RZGBMY514ZV8","A125OOI4EC2QCF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A125OOI4EC2QCF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The charm offered by Joe the Barbarian is enough to draw you in, but it's the hypnotic effect it has on you that will make you stay.  Written by the great Grant Morrison, Joe the Barbarian finds our young teen protagonist Joe in some dire straits.  He's an extreme diabetic, he's home alone, and he seriously needs to get his sugar up.  Making matters worse is the storm outside that kills the power inside his house, which really exacerbates the vivid hallucinations he has involving his action figures and his pet mouse Jack.  It all sounds like a ridiculous mish-mash of non-sense that wouldn't work with any other writer, but Joe the Barbarian shockingly manages to do all just that.  Morrison weaves a gripping and inventive tale, while artist Sean Murphy draws us such a gorgeously brilliant world that it becomes hard not to become trapped in it yourself.  All in all, do yourself a favor and pick up Joe the Barbarian, you'll be glad that you did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B44GD9X5JH2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401229719#wasThisHelpful","R3B44GD9X5JH2Y","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As much as I love Garth Ennis' The Boys, I'll be the first to admit that the past couple volumes of the series haven't been as great as the first few of the series.  All that being said, Butcher, Baker, Candlestickmaker is a spectacular read, and a brilliant origin story of Billy Butcher.  Collecting the six-issue mini-series, this volume details the tragic early youth and soldier years of the future leader of The Boys, leading up to meeting his eventual wife Becky, and the horror to unfold in the years afterwards.  Like the series has pretty much always been, Butcher, Baker, Candlestickmaker is a bloody, brilliant, and darkly hilarious trip.  Darick Robertson's artwork is still bloody brilliant as well, but it's Ennis' trademark writing and fully fleshing out the Butcher we all know and love that really makes this a winner.  Oh yeah, the final panels of this collection make it worth picking up in itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YSL1MJCFIST2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606902644#wasThisHelpful","R2YSL1MJCFIST2","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From director Tarsem Singh (The Cell) comes Immortals, a visual dynamo of a film that offers little to nothing else.  Henry Cavill (from The Tudors and soon to be seen as the new Superman) is Theseus; a mortal man chosen by Zeus (Luke Evans) to stop the evil King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) from finding a mythical bow used for unleashing the mythical Titans and laying waste to the rest of the world.  Along for the ride are a thief (Stephen Dorff) and an oracle (Freida Pinto) as Theseus fights and flexes his way across the screen, with blood and swordplay being the order of the day.  Much like The Cell, Immortals is a visual feast that features amazing technical achievements while offering little in the way of story or character development.  Not to mention the fact that there are so many plot holes and inconsistencies along the way that you'll be hard pressed keeping track of everything going on.  The film's battle and fight scenes are good, but there are too many slow moments that bog up the pace and as a result Immortals feels uneven.  Cavill does little to prove himself leading man material, as the rest of the cast (including John Hurt, Alan Van Sprang, Isabel Lucas, and Kellan Lutz) pretty much phones it in, but it's Mickey Rourke that manages to leave a lasting impression in an otherwise mediocre affair.  All in all, Immortals is visually appealing, and little else.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LQ6A538IPJRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LWZW8S#wasThisHelpful","R2LQ6A538IPJRA","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reign of Doomsday, which concludes Paul Cornell's run on Action Comics, is a super thrilling and wonderfully enjoyable.  Beginning with Superman facing off one last time against a super-powered Lex Luthor, and then continuing with the Superman family (Supes, Superboy, Supergirl, Steel, The Eradicator, and even the Cyborg) taking on multiple Doomsday's.  While the storytelling is fairly simplistic, part of the charm of Cornell's Action Comics run is that it provides everything a mainstream superhero comic should.  Smart and intelligent action and storytelling, with brilliant artwork from Pete Woods and a variety of others.  Not to mention the fact that this collection also features the landmark 900th issue of Action Comics, as well as a handful of backup stories featured in that issue featuring work from Geoff Johns, David Goyer, and more (and features the controversial tale involving Superman giving up his United States citizenship).  All in all, Reign of Doomsday is a wonderful and thrilling Superman tale that deserves your time and attention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RM7C5R9ZXYMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401233457#wasThisHelpful","R3RM7C5R9ZXYMB","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to believe that it's been seven years since ""In the Arms of God"", the last studio album from Corrosion of Conformity was released.  In that time, a lot has happened, most notably with C.O.C. singer/guitarist Pepper Keenan spending a majority of his time with Down, and C.O.C. seemed to be indefinitely put on the back-burner.  Now, here we are in 2012, and not only has C.O.C. returned with this new self-titled album, but they've returned boasting their classic lineup from the ""Animosity"" days.  Standout tracks, including ""The Doom"", ""Your Tomorrow"", and ""Psychic Vampire"" are sludgy, surprisingly breathtaking tracks that any lover of C.O.C.'s pre-Pepper days will enjoy, even if vocalist Mike Dean doesn't have that same growl he had way back when.  All that being said though, this self-titled release from Corrosion of Conformity is a wonderful throwback to a bygone era, and if they can manage to keep pumping out solid music like this, it will make us all miss Pepper a little less and less as time goes on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R3UH5LE3R84F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006XF2S8S#wasThisHelpful","R1R3UH5LE3R84F","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over 20 years later, Frankenhooker remains a totally trashy treat.  From the mind of Basket Case creator Frank Henenlotter, Frankenhooker revolves around an ex-medical student (James Lorinz) who seeks to bring his fiance (Penthouse pet Patty Mullen) back from the dead after her untimely death via remote control lawnmower.  What follows are some disgusting and hilarious moments, which still remain wonderfully enjoyable even all these years later.  Synapse has done another fine job with this Blu-Ray release, featuring some great special features and a wonderfully restored picture.  While Frankenhooker isn't for everyone, you won't find many films like it, which makes it all the more worthwhile for you to see if you've never experienced what Frankenhooker has to offer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YDSL2P3H6HA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005K08J8U#wasThisHelpful","R2YDSL2P3H6HA2","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on Mark Waid's ""Tower of Babel"" arc in JLA, Justice League: Doom finds the JLA under attack by the immortal Vandal Savage, who has managed to round up a group of villains (including Bane and Metallo) to take out the League members one by one.  That's pretty much it in a nutshell, as Doom manages to unleash some dark and rousing action and adventure throughout its brisk 77-minute run time, which ends up being just right enough that you won't notice the plot holes and unevenness all that much either.  While the film doesn't hold a candle to Waid's storyarc, it remains a thrilling ride while it lasts.  That, and the excellent voice cast that features returning fan favorites like Kevin Conroy as Batman, Tim Daly as Superman, Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern, Michael Rosenbaum as Flash, Carl Lumbly as Martian Manhunter, and Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman, really help make Doom a winner.  All in all, Justice League: Doom is an enjoyable and dark blast that deserves checking out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDSTNRK0MTEEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005SH63KG#wasThisHelpful","RDSTNRK0MTEEU","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Johnny Depp once again channels his late, great friend Hunter S. Thompson in this long overdue adaptation of The Rum Diary, which while it retains the spirit of Thompson's source material, it also sadly feels somewhat watered down.  Depp plays Paul Kemp, a hard-living New York journalist that winds up in San Juan.  As he gets a feel for the local colour (and booze), Kemp comes across the shady mogul Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) and instantly falls for his stunning fiance (Amber Heard) in the process.  Kemp's journey takes him through the good and bad of the locale and its denizens, although by the time the credits roll, you'll be left feeling a little empty inside.  The spirit of Thompson is definitely felt throughout the proceedings, but for some reason sadly it just doesn't feel one hundred percent right.  Still though, Depp is wonderful, and the rest of the cast, which also includes Richard Jenkins, Michael Rispoli, and Giovanni Ribisi in a scene-stealing role, are great.  All in all, The Rum Diary is hit and miss, and while it probably may never become the cult classic that Terry Gilliam's take on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas did, it's still worth your time regardless.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MU1IVE6G8RT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ISJQBM#wasThisHelpful","R1MU1IVE6G8RT5","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nancy in Hell is so ridiculous and over the top that it should probably get some sort of award.  A comic so awesome in its badness that you can't help but enjoy it for what it is.  What happens when an ultra-buxom cheerleader winds up in Hell?  Well, that's the story of our heroine Nancy, who finds herself trapped in Hell and trying to escape the horde of demonic forces and undead out to make her into mincemeat.  Nancy also finds herself with a very unlikely ally, and the two seek to escape the confines of the underworld in one big bloody blast.  Written by El Torres, Nancy in Hell is enjoyable for what it is and nothing more, nothing less.  It's a fun ride while it lasts, and the surprising twist and conclusion will leave you genuinely surprised.  The artwork by Juan Jose Ryp (Black Summer, Frank Miller's RoboCop) in the first two issues here is stunning, but the final two issues feature artwork by Antonio Vasquez, which while good, just doesn't match up to Ryp's incredible renderings.  All that aside, Nancy in Hell is a blast, and is well worth your time and attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36CVQE5J86HJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607063549#wasThisHelpful","R36CVQE5J86HJX","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What happens when the overnight employees of a local grocery store that's closing down are stalked by a crazed, bloodthirsty killer?  Ridiculous blood-letting that's what!  Though it takes some time to get going, Intruder features some inventive kills (with early effects work from KNB) and even performances from Evil Dead trilogy mastermind Sam Raimi and his brother Ted.

"I'm actually surprised by some of the reviews of Choke Hold here, many reviewers claiming that it falls short of Christa Faust's first Angel Dare book, Money Shot.  While I'll agree with them that Choke Hold doesn't pack the same kind of gut punch that Money Shot does, it is nevertheless a wonderful and enjoyably nasty noir tale.  Former porn star Angel Dare is in witness protection these days, working in a low-rent diner.  One day she comes across a former colleague/flame, and from that point forward it's a barrage of blood, bullets, and bare-knuckle knockouts.  Without giving too much else away, Angel is thrown head first into the world of Mixed Martial Arts fighting, and all beneath all the publicity and glitz, Faust paints almost as sordid a picture of the sport as she did with the pornography industry in Money Shot.  Packing its share of shocks and surprises, Choke Hold is an unapologetic blast.  While Faust doesn't do much to develop Angel's character any further than how she was by the time Money Shot came to a close, the novel still manages to work so well that you won't really pay it too much mind.  All in all, if you dug Money Shot, pick up Choke Hold; you won't regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R325RW04VYG05J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857682857#wasThisHelpful","R325RW04VYG05J","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing I've always liked about the PSP is that it has no shortage of import-type (and sometimes just plain weird) games in its library.  Pangya: Fantasy Golf is one such game, offering some fun golf gameplay with an anime-style presentation.  Unlike typical boring golf games, Pangya adds a few tweaks that keep things interesting and fun.  Graphically the game looks great for a PSP game, and is easy and simple to pick up and play.  Even if golf games aren't typically your thing, give Pangya: Fantasy Golf a try, you won't regret it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24B0QTR05VTF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026EV5MA#wasThisHelpful","R24B0QTR05VTF5","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cowboys & Aliens is far from being anything special in the least, but qualifies as an enjoyable popcorn flick that is best to be viewed with your brain at the door.  Daniel Craig plays an amnesiac gunslinger who awakens with a strange and powerful bracelet-type weapon on his wrist, and finds himself a wanted man by the law to boot.  Before you know it, he runs afoul of a nasty Harrison Ford, and eventually the alien beings that the film's title implies.  This Extended Edition provides a stronger story than the theatrical cut (as well as some decent amounts of bloody violence), but despite that though there isn't really anything all that special about the film, other that the draw and appeal of its two stars.  The action sequences are well orchestrated by Iron Man director Jon Favreau, and there are some surprisingly creepy moments to be found as well.  Olivia Wilde provides the requisite eye-candy, and Sam Rockwell, Adam Beach, Clancy Brown, Paul Dano, Walton Goggins, and Keith Carradine are all on board as well.  All in all, if you're looking to a kill a rainy afternoon, you could do a lot worse than Cowboys & Aliens.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFHAH6YM6ODU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EPYZSU#wasThisHelpful","R2YFHAH6YM6ODU","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A hilarious satire of backwoods horror conventions, Tucker & Dale VS Evil is a smashing good time.  Good natured hillbillies Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) plan on spending some time at Tucker's vacation cabin and do some fishing and work, only to run afoul of a group of college kids that completely have the wrong idea about the situation.  Before you know it, the college kids think Tucker and Dale are inbred hillbillies trying to kill them, and it isn't long before the blood and guts start flying.  What makes Tucker & Dale VS Evil so enjoyable isn't just how it turns the typical horror conventions on its head or flat out makes fun of them, but the delightful chemistry between Labine and Tudyk.  Not to mention the fact that these accident prone teens die in some flat out hysterically gruesome ways.  Also featuring uber-hottie Katrina Bowden as one of the few people here with a functioning brain, Tucker & Dale VS Evil is a hilarious blast that horror fans will no doubt love.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KFR3VEPJ3UM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HI4LLY#wasThisHelpful","R1KFR3VEPJ3UM4","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trent Reznor has come quite a long way.

"My introduction to Christa Faust, Money Shot is a bona-fide crime noir blast.  Angel Dare is a semi-retired porn star running her own production company and gets convinced to do one last starring feature alongside hot young male star Jesse Black.  Naturally, some very bad things are about to happen.  Left for dead and on the run from the law, Angel now finds herself scratching and fighting her way to get some good old fashioned revenge on everyone involved in turning her life upside down.  Twisty, nasty, and painting an incredibly ugly picture of the porn industry in the process, Money Shot is a treat.  It's everything one could ever want from a neo-noir story, and even though it seems to come apart a little bit by the time the novel winds to a close, Money Shot is a smashing piece of pulp nastiness that deserves your time and attention.

"What Arkham Asylum did so well, Arkham City takes and runs with it so far that what we have here now isn't just the best Batman game ever, but the best superhero video game ever made.  Once again playing as the Caped Crusader, you find yourself trapped in the middle of the desolate criminal wasteland of Arkham City as it appears every single villain in Batman's extensive rogues gallery is coming out of the woodwork...and they all have their own agendas, and all want a piece of you.  Featuring Joker, Hugo Strange, Harley Quinn, Two-Face, Riddler, Zsasz, Bane, Mr. Freeze, Penguin, Calendar Man, Deadshot, and plenty more besides; you're going to be in for a very long night.  Graphics and gameplay wise, things haven't really changed much from Arkham Asylum, but they didn't really have to.  The gameplay is still smooth and the action elements are wonderful, but it's the ton of side-missions that really stick out.  Playing phone tag with Zsasz, assisting Bane (yes you read that right), figuring out the next targets of Deadshot, and plenty, plenty more besides add so much to the replayability factor that you'll keep coming back.  Add to that the amount of downloadable content, including the oh so fun Catwoman missions, really make Arkham City so spectacular.  All in all, even if you missed out on Arkham Asylum, you have no reason to miss out on Arkham City.  It's the best superhero video game ever made, and you need to play it right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX5SNNAI5XWPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I0F5M8#wasThisHelpful","RX5SNNAI5XWPV","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Joe Quesada took over as Marvel EIC, he helped give refreshing takes on stale titles.  While Grant Morrison took on X-Men, the aging and boring mutant militant comic X-Force was given a complete makeover by writer Peter Milligan and Madman artist/creator Mike Allred.  Eventually re-titled X-Statix, the comic revolved around a team of mutant superheroes that were also big time celebrities, and frequently found themselves either dead or dying to boot.  Featuring brilliant and surreal artwork to go along with being absurdly and darkly funny as well as being surprisingly addictive, X-Statix was a treat throughout the remainder of its run, as it found itself eventually cancelled due to low sales.  This gorgeous Omnibus collects Milligan and Allred's complete X-Force/X-Statix run, which is wholeheartedly worth your time if you missed out on it way back when.  All in all, it's a shame that Marvel doesn't have an ongoing X-book that is this entertaining or original anymore, because no X-book around today is even half as good as X-Statix was.  That's right, I said it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39K2477VVJU8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785158448#wasThisHelpful","R39K2477VVJU8A","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rayman Origins defines everything that makes platforming games so great.  A tried and true 2-D side-scrolling adventure, you play as either Rayman or his pals and traverse multiple stages; pouncing on enemies, avoiding various spiky hazards, and saving nymphs and assorted creatures along the way.  What makes Rayman Origins so enjoyable is that this is practically flawless platforming action.  Granted there are moments of annoying pitfalls that can usually be found in any platformer, but these are few are far between.  Combine that with the spectacular art design and graphics of the game, along with the catchy soundtrack and some hefty replayability as well, Rayman Origins is simply divine.  All in all, longtime fans of the Rayman franchise, or platforming in general, should definitely pick up Rayman Origins; you won't regret it one bit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33NEQJYP6BA9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SX3KG#wasThisHelpful","R33NEQJYP6BA9L","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been a long time since I've played a pro wrestling game and enjoyed it (think the original WWF Smackdown! for the PS1), so it takes a lot for me to check out any pro wrasslin' game that comes along.  WWE All Stars I found hard to resist though: an arcade-style atmosphere with legendary brawlers like Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, Ricky Steamboat, Macho Man, Ultimate Warrior, Jake Roberts, and more besides mixing it up with current WWE superstars Randy Orton, John Cena, John Morrison, CM Punk, and others.  The game offers some great graphics and a hefty amount of gameplay modes (along with unlocking more wrestlers too) with the only drawback really being that the control scheme isn't easy to get a hold of when you first get into the game.  Maybe it's because I've stayed away from wrestling games for so long, but it took me a while to get used to it.  Once you do though, you'll have a blast with WWE All Stars.  All in all, if you want an arcade-experience fighting/wrestling game that will give you some nostalgiac moments of joy, give WWE All Stars a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P5GZAP97Y7Y9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003S2OOC2#wasThisHelpful","R2P5GZAP97Y7Y9","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jason Aaron has really made a name for himself over the past couple years.  With runs on Ghost Rider and PunisherMAX, as well as his own series Scalped for Vertigo, Aaron has quickly become one of the top writers in all of comics.  His time on Wolverine has been no different either, proving to be one of the best writers to ever tackle Marvel's mutant posterboy.  This storyarc, Wolverine's Revenge, picks up where Wolverine Goes to Hell left off, as Wolvie finds himself taking on the mysterious group known as the Red Right Hand, and discovering how his past intertwines with them, leading up to an ultimate gut wrencher of a conclusion.  The shocking storyline combined with the excellent artwork here really make this arc a winner, and further cement the fact that Jason Aaron is one of the absolute best writers in the industry today.  All in all, this is the best Wolverine has been in a while, and it deserves your time and attention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R375Y4DVVJW8OR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785152792#wasThisHelpful","R375Y4DVVJW8OR","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Say what you will about Grant Morrison, but there's no denying that there hasn't been as subversive a comic book writer since Alan Moore first came to fame.  His work on Animal Man, New X-Men, Batman, All Star Superman, and countless others has been celebrated for so long now that it's practically a rule by nature to hold the man in such high regard, and with Supergods, we get a better sense of the mind inside that bald head as he approaches playing around in comic book universes and bending them to his will.  Long time fans of Morrison's work will eat up Supergods with no problem, others though may have a bit of a hard time getting into it, specifically if you're not that much of a Morrison fan or have only read a few snippets of his work (those that panned Final Crisis should proceed with caution).  Personally I love seeing comic book personalities (such as Warren Ellis and Garth Ennis) breaking into the realm of more traditional literature, and Supergods may very well be the best out of them all.  Pick this up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8HUXSOY4IJOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069122#wasThisHelpful","R8HUXSOY4IJOO","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jason Aaron's run on PunisherMAX has been something special up until this point, and with this storyarc simply called Frank, Aaron goes overboard and gives us a psychological look at Frank Castle like we haven't had before.  Remember reading Garth Ennis' Born and wishing that it went on just a little bit more after Frank told his family to ""hold on tight""?  We get that here, as Frank reminisces about those days after the war in Vietnam ended and he came home, leading up to that fateful day in the park that seemingly birthed The Punisher.  All the while, Frank is in bad shape since his battle with Bullseye, and is recovering in the prison infirmary at Ryker's, and everyone wants to be the guy that put The Punisher down.  Where as in the first two storyarcs, Kingpin and Bullseye, Aaron pulled out all the stops in terms of shocks, Frank is much more introspective and shockingly poignant.  Jason Aaron has truly made Garth Ennis proud.  Steve Dillon provides more great pencilwork as well, solidifying the fact that no one draws The Punisher better.  All in all, Jason Aaron continues to nicely fill the shoes of Garth Ennis, and by the time his run is all wrapped up, who knows...he may go down as the only Punisher writer to stand on his own outside Ennis' shadow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIHOVNMPMV695/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785152083#wasThisHelpful","RIHOVNMPMV695","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marv Wolfman and George Perez's prolific run on The New Teen Titans is, to say it lightly, staggering.  A beloved series from beloved creators, New Teen Titans was something special in its heyday in the 80s, and now Wolfman and Perez return with Games.  Games is something of a time-capsule in a way, considering that it was originally crafted in 1988 as a be all end all to the pair's run on the title, and it was never finished...until now.  Games finds the Titans (Nightwing, Starfire, Cyborg, Changeling, Raven, Jericho, Troia, and Danny Chase) in the middle of a catastrophic showdown with someone known only as the Gamesmaster, but it becomes obvious that things aren't quite as they seem.  King Faraday is thrown into the mix, along with some other players, as things quickly go from bad to worse for everyone involved.  While the artwork of Perez is gorgeous naturally, Wolfman's story is a little lacking and occasionally confusing.  All that aside though, having this proper conclusion to Wolfman and Perez's New Teen Titans run is just plain awesome.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYHTP2TR6KMUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401233228#wasThisHelpful","RYHTP2TR6KMUU","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In an age of cruddy, needless remakes coming out seemingly every other week, the fact that the Fright Night remake is surprisingly good is quite refreshing indeed.  The basic premise of the original remains the same, as high schooler Charlie (Anton Yelchin) suspects his neighbor Jerry (Colin Farrell) is a blood-thirsty vampire when denziens of his Vegas suburb begin to go missing.  Things begin to go from bad to worse as Charlie's mother (Toni Collete) and gorgeous girlfriend (Imogen Poots) get caught in the crossfire, leading him to seek out the assistance of horror illusionist Peter Vincent (David Tennant) as things reach a bloody climax.  Alterations to the original film's story aside, this new take on Fright Night works, and delivers the goods for those looking for real vampire thrills in this age of sparkling teenage vamps that take too much care of their hair.  Colin Farrell acts every bit the predator vamp, and the great David ""Dr. Who"" Tennant steals the whole show here.  While it isn't perfect and leaves a little to be desired (i.e., some of the CGI effects are pretty lame looking), Fright Night is a bloody good time regardless.  All in all, if you're a fan of the original film, check this out, you may find yourself pleasently surprised.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUO4NXCMN5KK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KA188S#wasThisHelpful","RUO4NXCMN5KK4","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A nearly cancelled gem of a DS game, Sega's Aliens: Infestation is a tough 2-D side scroller that harkens back to the 8 and 16-bit glory days of games like Castlevania and Metroid, only with the Alien license slapped on it.  By all means though, this is a good thing, as Aliens: Infestation is the best game to wield the Alien license in years.  Taking control of a group of colonial marines, you run and gun your way through treacherous corridors and other locations as deadly Xenos look to make you into mince-meat.  You'll also encounter facehuggers, dangerous robots, and other hazards and enemies along the way, while getting to wield franchise standard weapons like the Pulse Rifle and Flamethrower.  While Aliens: Infestation is a great game, let it be known right now that this game is not for lightweight gamers.  There's no regenerating health bar, there's no frequent checkpoints; this is pure 2-D side scrolling action the way we remember it: tough and fun.  The few flaws the game has lie in its difficulty however, including the fact that once you start firing, you're locked in that position and can't turn around to fire at something behind you.  Not to mention that the area layouts can get confusing and you'll do quite a bit of backtracking (which helps hide the fact that this game is actually really short), but other than all that, Aliens: Infestation is a gem.  It's wonderfully animated and surprisingly really creepy with some jump-worthy moments.  That in itself makes Aliens: Infestation worth picking up whether you're a new 3DS owner or have an old DS that needs to have the dust wiped off of it.  All in all, if you want a side scrolling run and gun game for your old DS and love the Alien franchise, by all means pick this up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R383H1UXJSFYJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C2QSDY#wasThisHelpful","R383H1UXJSFYJU","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Further proving that Jason Aaron is a more than worthy successor to Garth Ennis, the Bullseye storyarc of PunisherMax finds the insane and deadly assassin known as Bullseye taking Frank Castle in his sights.  What develops throughout is one of the bloodiest, disturbing, and just plain brutal examples of a cat and mouse game ever seen in a comic book.  Just like he did with the Kingpin the last time around, Aaron inserts the classic Daredevil villain into Marvel's MAX world and makes him the most terrifying he's ever been.  He gets in Frank's head (and the methods to do so have to be seen to be believed) like no one ever has before, and before its all said and done the Punisher will never be the same.  Steve Dillon provides more of his excellent pencilwork to the proceedings, rounding out the overall package.  All in all, Jason Aaron's PunisherMax is the best treatment the character has gotten since Garth Ennis' prolific run came to an end.  Seriously, you will not find a better take on the Punisher other than Ennis than what Aaron continues to do with the character.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BBOCIVHOK1J5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785147551#wasThisHelpful","R3BBOCIVHOK1J5","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Forget the Stallone flick from the 90s (and possibly even the upcoming new take starring Karl Urban, I've got a bad feeling about it...), this is the one and only Judge Dredd.  One of the most important comic book characters ever, this first collected edition of early Dredd tales is essential reading.  In a lawless mega-metropolis of a future, there aren't any cops, there's Judges.  The toughest and most take-no-prisoners of them all is Joseph Dredd, who never removes his helmet and takes his job uber-seriously.  As previously mentioned by another reviewer, these early Judge Dredd stories that appeared in the British comic magazine 2000 A.D. were a satirical take on typical American Hollywood action hero conventions, but were also surprisingly fun, entertaining, and occasionally endearing.  This first collection of the Case Files doesn't feature the best of Judge Dredd per se', but it sets the stage for the adventures of a legendary comic book character, and one of the most revered antiheroes in comic book history as well.  If all you know of Judge Dredd is that excuse of an adaptation starring Sylvester Stallone, pick up these collections to get the real effect of who Judge Dredd really is.  You won't regret it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7YC8J8MR91EJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906735875#wasThisHelpful","R7YC8J8MR91EJ","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite all the negativity surrounding Metallica over the years (most of it deserved), I remained a huge fan throughout my youth.  There's no denying the impact the band has had on the metal genre, bringing it to mainstream audiences like no band ever could before, and in all honesty, no band has really been able to do since.  Acts over the years like Korn, Disturbed, and countless others have achieved great deals of mainstream success, but didn't have either the staying power, or the mix of raw talent and songwriting ability that Metallica had all throughout the 1980s to the late 90s.  Now, here we are.  The most legendary metal band other than Black Sabbath uniting with legendary singer/songwriter Lou Reed to bring us ""Lulu""; a collaboration of two distinctly different acts that could either be a smashing success or a complete and utter train wreck.  Well folks, ""Lulu"" is possibly the biggest train wreck of music I think I've ever heard.  With the Metallica boys in the background and Lou on vocals, ""Lulu"" is an unimaginitive mess.  Every single track on this album sounds so disjointed and just plain ugly that you'll be plugging your ears from the get-go.  I'm not exaggerating here or kidding either, ""Lulu"" is just plain horrible.  The real tragedy about this is two legendary acts combining to make this.  It wasn't a match that made sense to begin with, which is kind of what made me look so forward to it in the first place: it was something different.  Well, it is something different alright, it's just plain garbage.  It's a shame too, ""Lulu"" could have been something that at least warranted a listen for fans of either, or any, music genre.  Instead, this is what we're left with: a gaping black hole on the careers and discography of Metallica and Lou Reed alike.  Avoid.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10GPIWZIQAJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NPLXJ4#wasThisHelpful","R10GPIWZIQAJF","AJKWF4W7QD4NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKWF4W7QD4NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been quite a while since we had a studio album from Anthrax, and even longer since we had one featuring classic vocalist Joey Belladonna leading the way.  With ""Worship Music"", Belladonna has returned to the fold and is once again voicing the legendary thrash pioneers, and things just couldn't be better.  ""Worship Music"" is just plain awesome and enjoyable metal that you can't help but love.  Standout tracks like ""Earth on Hell"", ""The Devil You Know"", ""Fight 'Em Til You Can't"", ""I'm Alive"", and ""Judas Priest"" are practically perfect, and remind you of the fact that in this day and age of cruddy metal pretending to be hard, the original forefathers of the genre still do it the best (mostly that is, I'm not mentioning anything involving a certain band that starts with the letter ""M"" and ends with ""etallica"").  Belladonna himself sounds great, and while I do miss John Bush on vocals, having the band's classic vocalist here just adds to how awesomely enjoyable ""Worship Music"" ends up being.

On the porridge setting, it makes a lovely lentil soup.This is a handsome little unit that doesn't take up much counter space in my tiny kitchen; if I need to move it, there's a convenient handle that is well designed and sturdy. The lid closes like a luxury car door.

"Although the back of the package recommends mixing this 8-Grain 1:4 with white rice, I prefer it 1:1 with Genmai or GABA brown rice as a breakfast rice, or as lovely mixed grain dinner rice. 8-Grain is perfectly balanced in texture and taste, adding both nuttiness and a delicate texture to white, brown, or percentage rice.It is delicious with apples and almond milk (sweet), with soy sauce and sesame oil (savory), or just some steamed vegetables.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYI7O82MEE5SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K447JWE#wasThisHelpful","RYI7O82MEE5SR","A11LNPG39A2ZV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11LNPG39A2ZV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Canon has introduced several new printers for home/small office use; the PIXMA MG5720 is the most trim-featured model. It has 5 ink tanks, and the lowest resolution DPI, while still including scan, print, and copy.However, it still has simple setup over wi-fi, as well as AirPrint, a high-speed USB connection (cable not included), an LCD (display-only) screen, and 100-sheet capacity for plain paper - which it will duplex print! After simple app setup*, I could easily print from my iPhone and iPad, which keeps photos from falling into a black hole.Solid printer with a good set of basic features in a well-designed package.*Download the iPhone app onto your phone or iPad.

"Vichy Dermafinish comes in a medium sized squeeze tube, and the shade I received for testing was correct for my skin tone.The foundation is creamy, smooth, and applies easily with fingers or makeup brush, and gives even coverage whether applied in a light, medium, or full layer.Unfortunately, Vichy Dermafinish didn't wear well during the day; on dry patches, it flaked off (ugh - not a problem I ever have with my Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue), and on my cheeks it sank into every pore.The foundation is a physical sunblock, courtesy of titanium dioxide, so it photographs poorly and changes color in different lighting. It also includes dimethicone near the top of it's ingredient list, so it would cause break-outs for me or anyone else sensitive to silicones.If you need the specialized coverage of Vichy Dermablend, you'll love the texture and easy application, as well as the SPF30.

"I've used earlier versions of the PUR pitcher and been very pleased with them, so I was eager to see if this was any sort of an improvement. Turns out, you can improve on the PUR pitcher.The Ultimate Pitcher uses the same reliable filter that gets rid of so many impurities in our municipal water supplies (and I'm truly thankful they are as safe as they are). The documentation also lists many medications that are removed by the filter, and that was new to me; I'm sure I don't need the assortment of hormones and other drugs that are present in today's water.The filter is easier to lock into the upper reservoir than in earlier versions; thank you, PUR! Though the reservoir is small relative to the pitcher's capacity, this keeps the pitcher streamlined. The lid has a convenient opening for filling the reservoir, rather than taking the whole lid off, much more sanitary. A small flap opens to allow the PURified water to flow out. The LED indicator is on the redesigned cover. The handle has been redesigned as well, and is far easier on my hands.The 7-cup size is perfect for the water pitcher I keep upstairs in my bedroom minifridge. No reason to have bad water - or bottled water - when you can have a nice blue pitcher of PUR.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28FMAUJSQ9LA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FQ8QHO#wasThisHelpful","R28FMAUJSQ9LA7","A11LNPG39A2ZV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11LNPG39A2ZV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I love the cheerful berry color of the lid, a non-rusting non-BPA plastic with a strong seal. This is a Mason jar substitute - it's got much of the charm, but none of the foibles; it won't shatter, rust, or leak in your bag.

"Outstanding puppet, first quality materials, captivating to both children and adults! I've loved using puppets with children for many years, and found them fun, educational, and easy for children to relate to.This beautiful Snowy Owl puppet - it's a female owl, it turns out - captured the attention of several children I asked to help me with this review, as well as a number of adults who stopped by. Those who were teachers were well-acquainted with Folkmanis puppets and spoke highly of their value in the classroom; I was simply enchanted with their variety, and the obvious attention to detail in their construction. All of this adds up to a very happy puppetry experience, when used by an adult or a child over the age of 6, in the case of this Snowy Owl. It does take two hands to move both the head AND the wings at the same time, though it is quite life-like to move the head, THEN the wings, so it is quite possible to manage the puppet with one hand.Overall, a perfect choice for home or classroom.

"Poise Impressa Bladder Supports are a disposable soft and flexible pessary, that's fitted at home by the user, inserted like a tampon, and worn for just 8 hours at a time. Bottom line - they work. And today's woman may just be ready for such an over-the-counter solution to bladder leakage.The bladder support comes with complete directions for fitting and use, and the supports are - for an at-home device - remarkably comfortable and effective. They will not take the place of an office-fitted pessary, which can be left in place for extended periods of time without any sensation at all, if it is a truly perfect fit. A pessary fits between a series of anatomical landmarks to prevent bladder leakage, as well as treat other symptoms not discussed in the Poise Impressa literature. The Poise Impressa solely focuses on bladder leakage, and does it quite well, depending on the anatomy of the wearer (as a reviewer of the product, I'm certainly not qualified to comment on the limitations of the product as related to conditions outside its stated use).The bladder support is inserted like a tampon, something 99.9% of women are familiar with. My one recommendation would be to lean over forward (very far forward) during insertion to allow as much space as possible for the bladder support to expand between the aforementioned anatomical landmarks if the first few uses are less than successful. The applicator is removed, and the support expands to put gentle pressure on the structures to allow them to function more normally; no more urinating while coughing, laughing, sneezing, etc.This is an impressive product, and will bring blessed relief to dignified women who are closet tinklers. Follow all cautions on the product. Renew your acquaintance with your GYN if you have any problems. Allow your body to adjust. Lubricate. And enjoy your freedom.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D3Q96C9LOFT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGZSI80#wasThisHelpful","R3D3Q96C9LOFT5","A11LNPG39A2ZV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11LNPG39A2ZV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had a consistent problem with bird strikes against my north facing sliding glass window over the past year, so I'm very glad to have the opportunity to give these window films a try.The Bird's Eye View films are thick, substantial, with both texture (which act as reflective rings), UV, color, and pattern to warn birds of window glass. They apply to clean windows with the adhesive power of water and their own natural cling - ie, you can reuse, and replace them. Instructions say to apply about every 4"", and the package includes 6 decals. I simply put the six decals across my windows in a straight line where there was (sad) evidence of bird strikes.Since applying them, I've seen no more bird strikes, and it's a busy bird mating and fledging season here at the moment, so I think they are doing their job admirably. If it turns out they are not at the proper level, it's easy to move them (they have thick edges, so they are easy to pick up from the windows) to a better location. An advantage for apartment dwellers is that they are applied from the inside. Well done Bird's Eye!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TIXKJAU1RH0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K65NN80#wasThisHelpful","R1TIXKJAU1RH0Z","A11LNPG39A2ZV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11LNPG39A2ZV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This little vac is outstanding! I've downsized to 100 square feet of living space, so I use several small appliances - and the problem with small things is that they can be underpowered, badly designed, or just toys. Not so with this Shark Rocket!As a test, I used the pet rotating brush (which will not attach to the hose, but must attach directly to the handheld unit) to vacuum my sisal area rug (8 x 12). Slam dunk, it had plenty of power to pick up stray bits of yarn (I'm a knitter), the usual dust and dirt, and my floor looked terrific. The pet rotating brush didn't really get up dust, so I switched out for the hose and passive brush - still plenty of suction - to go over the rest of my room.

"Yes, please! Four pounds of chocolate and peanut butter goodness on my doorstep, perfect for eating, sharing with friends, and baking projects.The flavor is fresher than I remember - but it's been a while since I've had the miniatures - and there's nothing quite like the distinct, excellent chocolate, and the authentic peanut butter flavor.

"I lovelovelove the electronic view finder! This is the first camera I've used since switching to digital that offers this feature, and I've really missed it - bright sun that washes out the LCD, and a lifetime's habit of checking the viewfinder, have left me wishing for this feature on my EDC digital cameras (quite a number of Panasonic Lumixes, Canons, Nikons, and a Casio). In this case, the viewfinder is electronic, so it is an accurate reflection of the LCD screen, a bit of an optical illusion that in the end, will give me a better idea of what I'm shooting.There are the usual choices of Auto, Scene, and the preferential modes, as well as superb video. The zoom is outstanding (and you can set the ZS50 to remember the zoom setting, very helpful when birding), as well as the macro; the Leica lens is housed in a lightweight matte-painted metal body that at first nonplussed me, but captured me with its weight and balance, housing an outstanding lens at this price. In addition, Panasonic made the decision to charge the battery in camera with a micro-USB cable that ends with a - wait for it - USB connector! Yes, it slips into the Panasonic charging block (marked 5v, 800mA), and your laptop, but I suspect it may be far easier to charge on the road than my previous camera batteries.Then there's the wi-fi! Panasonic has added a power-hungry feature (but remember the easy charging) that I'm going to love when traveling. Knowing I can upload my photos directly from the camera to a cloud service, my computer, or my phone is reassuring, and one less step. Again, this feature is a step up from the cameras I've used in the past, many of them predecessors of this Lumix.Delighted with the quality of the photos, both zoom  and macro, as well as a recent holiday with family. This Lumix is a winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D25J5PGCMWV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RBG687A#wasThisHelpful","R1D25J5PGCMWV0","A11LNPG39A2ZV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11LNPG39A2ZV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan - ok, total addict - of the Brother P-Touch labeler since it came to the home market. Some of the labelers are easier to use than others, but I've had a trusty labeler and tapes in my desk for years. I thought it would be great to try out a wireless labeler.Other reviewers mentioned the difficulty in setting up the wireless connection, so I went directly to Brother for the latest Mac OS X 10.10.x drivers and held my breath; the installation, with the included USB cable - directing the software to choose wireless as the preferred connection ** while connected by USB ** - worked like a charm. My MacBook Air 13"" was able to find the PTP750W on the network right away.Here's where a glitch set in. I opened the PTouch Editor software, and chose to use a prepared template, and it quit. I tried not using a template, it quit. Restarted, it quit. After multiple tries, I was able to close the Template Chooser, and use the software to print labels. The PTouch Editor can detect the label in the printer, and sets up a box for text. Piece of cake to type in text and numbers, format and print. Barcodes, QR codes, and address book are all available from the task bar.I was able to use my iPhone and Brother iPrint & Label App to successfully test the label printer, too. It offers a simplified menu of options that includes barcode printing (multiple types), QR codes, multiple templates, photo labels, and the ability to save labels. Even this simple label app offers dozens of fonts and features, automatic label detection, and multi-line printing. It doesn't offer access to your contacts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG0H9W5WYKHJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHME7W4#wasThisHelpful","RG0H9W5WYKHJ2","A11LNPG39A2ZV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11LNPG39A2ZV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So far so good.  I have been running this switch for about 1 month now.  It replaced my 8 port / 4 port POE switch from TP-Link.

With the unmanaged switch there was a noticeable lag at times when all cameras were recording to my NVR.While the interface is advanced it is still easy to use and work with.

"Epson is trying to change the printer landscape in the U.S.  Pay more for the printer but less for the ink.  I am a fan of this idea; however, it is too early to know if this will take off and if the printer can really save you money in two years.  If you do not do a large amount of printing then it will be hard for you to recoup the costs in two years.I have small concern around the warranty and its length.  The warranty on the ET-4550 from the date of purchase is one year or 50,000 sheets. If you register the printer you get an extra year but the sheets remain at 50,000.  Not sure how many people would hit the 50,000 sheets in two years but it is something to be aware of.  If you are paying that much more for the printer I would have liked to see a warranty in the 3 to 5 years.  Having a $100 printer fail just outside of the warranty period is easier to deal with than a $500 printer, I have had this printer for about month now and these are my initial thoughts and impressions.- Ink FillingEven with taking my time, I still spilt some black ink.  Make sure you have something under the ink tanks prior to filling.Once filled, it takes around 20 minutes for the printer to have the internal ink cartridges ready.- SetupSetup on my wireless network was quick.  Printer found my network and I connected the printer.I downloaded the latest drivers from Epson’s website rather using the CD that came with the printer.  Drivers installed and located the printer on my network- Print SpeedThis printer is quick but not as fast as my Epson workforce 845 I have.- ColorsThe color prints on this printer are much more muted than those from the workforce.  This is a negative for me, I prefer the colors to be more vibrant.  I would not even consider trying a photo on this printer.  (This printer is not really made for printing photos)- Cloud OptionsI was already using the Epson Connect feature prior to this printer.  Adding this printer to my account was an easy process.It is too early for me to recommend this printer over the normal cartridge based printer.  As I have more time with the printer I will update my recommendation.  My rating is 3 1/2 stars.  (Warranty length concerns and the colors are muted)If you have questions, please add them to the comments field.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23RJNGB2OOJSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JFSM#wasThisHelpful","R23RJNGB2OOJSQ","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This does come with other attachments and can use it to clean your but the primary purpose is the mattress. This Dyson comes with a special mattress attachment to get the dust and must mites out of the mattress.Prior to using the vacuum I fully charged it.  It did arrive with a charge.  Stated time to charge is 3.5.  I did not test to verify that claim because I let charge over night.I was able to clean a queen, full, and part of a twin mattress on one charge.  We have covers on all our mattresses.  Even with the covers there was still a fair amount of dust on the mattresses.My only negative is the battery. If you use the max mode to get even better cleaning you can complete one mattress before the need to recharge.  It would be if Dyson used a removable battery system similar to my Dewalt tools.Overall another excellent product from Dyson.

"BLU has produced a good low cost entry level 4G LTE phone. There were some sacrifices made by BLU in order to achieve the price, which means this phone is not for everyone.In my opinion this phone is perfect for anyone who does not want to be stuck in and contract and does not plan to install many apps or play more graphic intensive games.  The phone is good for using the Internet, taking pictures as long as you are using a microsd card, making phone calls, and a lighter usage of apps.I rated this phone 4 stars. The rating based on the criteria I have listed.I have tested this phone on both at&t and T-Mobile networks.  I am including screenshots in my review. Feel free to ask questions in the comments field and I will try to answer them.CONS- Device Storage: This is my biggest CON.  The cost difference between 8GB and 16GB NAND Flash is minimal. The company should have gone with 16GB even if they decided to slightly increase the cost of the phone. Considering the Android OS takes up a good portion of the storage, which will be worse with Lollipop once BLU pushes out the upgrade later this year.  . available storage showed 4.66GBYes you can add a Microsd card but many apps cannot be move to the MicroSD card.- RAM:  1GB of RAM limits the amount of multitasking you can perform without suffering from stuttering. No issues watching Netflix- Shipping with KitKat rather than Lollipop does not make much sense with a new phone.- Missing BAND 5 (at&t) and BAND 12 (T-Mobile) LTE Bands.  This could impact some people.- Single Band WiFi.  2.4Ghz only.PROS:- Not much bloatware like you see with the major manufacturers.  Mostly Google apps and only a few BLU apps- Easy to navigate and use interface.- Nice display, sure it is not 1080 or Quad HD but the battery will last longer and allows for the lower price point- Multi Sim: You can have to 2 SIM cards in the phone but you cannot use a microsd card if you use both SIM ports- Price: Even with the low device storage, you still get a more than capable 4G LTE phone- Camera: The photos look great with the camera.  Lower light photos do suffer from noise.- Battery: While not removable this battery performs well enough to last the day with moderate usage.  Overnight with phone idle, it lost about 7% of battery after about 8 hours.Other options: At this price point you could look for older models from the big manufacturers like the S4 or G2.  You could also consider spending a little more a get the Alcatel Idol 3, which gives you more storage and RAM. It also has all the LTE bands in the US.  There is also the ASUS Zenfone 2 or phone from Huawei.  I have not had any experience with the idol 3. Zenfone 2, or any Hauwei.  There many other options out there but not many new phones with 4G LTE phone around $150.  There is not really any competition for a LTE smartphone at the $100 introductory price.As I mentioned above, I have tested this phone on T-Mobile and at&t networks in SoCal. T-Mobile’s 4G LTE was much faster than at&t’s Network. I tried both the phone and pta at&t APN settings.  I also added hipri to the at&t APN with little change.  Results will vary depending on where you live and the bands you connect to.  I did receive the 4G LTE logo on the phone from both networks.Overall the phone is good and will work for many people but if you are app lover and or gamer you should look elsewhere because you really need a phone with more storage and RAM.  I will continue to update the review as I get more use with the phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25E20OOP7DTQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YR23W1G#wasThisHelpful","R25E20OOP7DTQQ","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is definitely not the right time of the year to test the full potential of the sleeping bag, I have no doubt the bag will keep you warm in cold temperatures.  While I have not gone backpacking yet since receiving the sleeping, I did give it a try for one night.  Within 10 minutes I was unzipping the side to allow some air in.  The sleeping bag warmed up quickly.  I am looking forward to using the sleeping bag during the winter.The construction of the sleeping bag is good. The stitching and the fill is even dispersed throughout the bag. The bag is lightweight and easy to roll up but there is some struggle to put it back into the bag the sleeping bags come with. There is not much wiggle room once you are in the bag, which may be an issue for some people.If you are trying to decide between the regular or the long, this is my opinion.  If you are in the 5’10” to 6’ range I would recommend going with the long. It is a tight fit and you would be better off with the extra length.I would recommend this sleeping bag to friends and family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VCX6FOXRZZW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCFDRA#wasThisHelpful","R1VCX6FOXRZZW5","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The portable WD 2TB provides plenty of storage in a small form factor with ability to lock the drive with a password.With the drive being 2TB, the thickness is more than a slim 500GB drive but this will not be an issue for most people.  I had no problem powering the drive from one USB port.  If you have a really old laptop there is the possibility of the drive not powering on.  If your laptop has USB 3.0 there should not be a concern.  The drive is backwards compatible with USB 2.0.With the initial tests on transfer speed I was averaging 45MBs.  This is not as fast as my other WD 1TB portable drive, which I average 50MBs.  The drive is still fast.The backup software works but I prefer Macrium over the WD Backup.  It does a good job automatically locating file types for backup.  There is also “a” cloud backup option, which is dropbox. I am hoping WD changes this to include some of the other big players in the market.  (Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, and Amazon Cloud).  Dropbox is too cost prohibitive.With the WD security you can setup a password to lock the drive.  You can have up to 25 character password.  The one negative I have is, I could not paste the password into the fields when setting up the security.  It is not fun having to type a 25 character password that I generated from my password safe.

"Considering the price point the pendant necklace is good.  Though I do believe the list price is unrealistic.The chain is very thin but it is stamped with 925.  I do have some concerns that chain will break easy but should hold up under normal usage.  Definitely do not want your kids pulling on it.  The clasp is small but I had no issue opening and closing it.The Blue Topaz stone shines while the created sapphires give the pendant a diamond look but are small.Overall I do believe it is a good value","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39RSHK6RD4P7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOPKYTA#wasThisHelpful","R39RSHK6RD4P7I","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a vote looming in California and with multiple cities already banning plastic bags, there is a need to have an alternative unless you want to pay 10 cents per paper bag.The canvas bags are fairly heavy duty and can hold a good amount of weight.  The only issue I have is they are narrow so the bags do not have a wide base.  Nothing fancy with the plain color ones.Couple other options;Many grocery stores sell reusable bags for a $1 to $1.5.  They are not nearly as strong but you can buy a larger amount to distribute the weight. Depending on the material they may not be washableA big membership warehouse has their branded canvas  They are bigger and cheaper.Overall the bags are good but if you are looking to replace plastic bags consider larger bags.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26Y3KDVS9N0DS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGQAA9I#wasThisHelpful","R26Y3KDVS9N0DS","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My other food processor is Kitchenaid 5 Cup, which complete looks tiny now. The 5 cup is 15 years old now so it has held up overtime. This 14 cup is massive and is impressive in performance as it is in size.  Hopefully it lasts as long. Upon opening the box, I quickly realized how things have changed.  The food processor comes with a storage bin for all the blades, which was not the case with my old one.  I have the food processor for about a month now and have used it a few times.  So far I have only used the dicing and slicing blades.I immediately broke out of the dicing kit to give it a try. Dicing potatoes for breakfast potatoes and Potatoes O'Brien was a breeze.  The dice size is excellent for them.  I also made Pico De Gallo.  While the Pico De Gallo look and tasted good, the dice size is too big for traditional for Pico De Gallo.  I looked through Kitchenaids website for a possible smaller dicing grate that could be swapped with the one that came with it.  Unfortunately, I did not see one at first glance.The other blade I used was the slicing,  The thickness of the slice can be adjusted quickly.  Slicing through cucumbers and potatoes was a breezeFor the most part clean was not difficult. However, when dicing tomatoes and onions there is fair amount that get wedge into the top of the lid.  I found using the handle of a spoon or fork get the tomatoes and onions out easily.Overall is this a fantastic food processor and would have no problem recommending it to friends and family.  I am not able to comment on the durability because I have only had it for a month but if holds up like my 15 year old 5 cup then I would be happy.  As I get more use I will update my review if my opinion changes,","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQCLOEBBI9JC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEWVEOY#wasThisHelpful","RNQCLOEBBI9JC","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having put this shredder to good use within in a month I am on the fence for recommending it. I already have a 20 sheet shredder, which I have owned for around 4 years and has been a great shredder.  So I had expected another great shredder considering the price point.The only way I see this shredder shredding 200 sheets of paper without problems is if you take them out of a ream of paper. This shredder has issues with paper that is not close to perfect.  I never used more than 40 sheets of paper.  There was only one time where I did not have to open that lid and re-seat the paper.  I have not come close to running it for 12 minutes.Another I issue I have is I believe Fellow completely shortcut the paper bin.  They used corrugated plastic instead of plastic like in my other Fellowes shredder.  I do not see this holding up over time.  If this bin does not hold over a couple of years than I may raise my rating from 3 to 4 stars.A major plus, this shredder is much quieter than my other Fellowes shredder.As I mentioned in the beginning, I am on the fence for a recommendation. The shredder works but I would have expected better results based on the price point","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT4NW5LHB5AMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW90WU#wasThisHelpful","RT4NW5LHB5AMK","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very impressed with this impact driver after using the Bosch Impact driver for almost a month. This is a good choice for anyone who is looking to make an investment in cordless tools.  You are less likely if you have already invested in another brand but the Bosch hybrid Impact driver would be a great addition to your investmentI already have big investment in Dewalt 20v Max cordless tools.  I will not start making a any large investment in Bosch simply because of all the Dewalt batteries and tools I have.  I will pickup an additional battery because current I do have any Dewalt tools with the 1/2 socket.Comparing this to my Dewalt Impact Driver.Size: The Bosch is only slightly bigger and heavierDriving Power:  The Bosch has more torque than my Dewalt but I do not notice any difference.  Both drive with ease.Battery life:  Both batteries hold their charge and can weeks with light usage.  I did not try run the battery down to see how long the induced battery lasts.  I would always recommend having at least two batteries when you are work with the tools all day.Items that my Dewalt does not have:Wireless Charging:  While it does take longer to charge the battery vs my Dewalt charger. The convenience of placing the driver on top of the charger is good.  However; I will say you are most likely to take the battery off so you can continue to use the driver.  So the gain in the time will be minimal and charge time is longer but not by much.If other manufactures begin making wireless charge tools, it would be nice of the charge stations would be interchangeable. I know the batteries will not be.Socket Driver:  Having the a socket driver built in is nice.  I will have to buy a separate tool for this.  Having the hybrid does increase the cost of the tool; however, I would say this justified because you normally have to buy two tools.  The socket driver works well, you will not be taking the tires off your car but it does an excellent job in many applicationsAt this point I have nothing negative to say about the Bosch.  This could change as I get more usage.  I will update my review in that case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKSXPKBOE12B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND4H4K4#wasThisHelpful","RKSXPKBOE12B1","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This a big step up from my current set of steak knives from Ginsu, The Ginsu are good set but do not have the quality feel of these Lenox.

"We currently have Remington 1” flat iron, which does not get as hot and does not vibrate like the Infiniti pro.  There is no difference in the results. Both do a good job straightening curly hair.  My wife’s hair dresser swears by the vibration but we saw better results with the vibration off. To be fair the hair dresser does use a different flat iron where the vibration is much more pronounced.

"Big price tag but with the picture that it produces the cost is justified. This Epson Cinema projector is big and puts out a fair amount of heat.  The heat should not be an issue unless unless are encasing the projector.My previous experience with a cinema projector did not have a good level of black; however, the gray did bother me.  This is no longer an issue with the 5025UB.  The picture is fantastic and blacks are black.  Currently I have 100"" screen but plan to upgrade to 120"" soon.  The lens shift help square up the picture with the screen The color balance is excellent. The colors are on par with our 46"" LG LED TV in our bedroom.The 2200 lumens does allow for the picture show through even when there is a fair amount light in the room. Obviously it is not ideal and one should try to eliminate light to see the quality of pictures it produces.You can hook up your sound / HDMI connections through any receiver that has the HDMI support.I did not try 3D, 3D has never been a selling point for me.

"This fan does a great job circulating air around the room but I would recommend going with a bigger fan if you are looking for a fan for a larger room.  Having the inner plastic piece really pushes the air in multiple directions While Keystone does not provide the best instructions, the fan is easy assemble. The remote was not too difficult to open even though no instructions are include.  You can see that you need to push the tab in and pull the battery cover I do like how the height adjustment works but it does lower too easy with very little pressure.  With the price point one would expect a little better build quality.  I have 18"" Holmes fan that is built better and is lower in cost.  I have not owned the fan long enough to comment on if it will hold up to the test of time.One item I do not care for is having the buttons on the base, sure you can use the remote but I would rather have the buttons on the riserI rated the fan 3 stars because I believe it is an average fan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JPA4SNNYOXD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQ1X82G#wasThisHelpful","R2JPA4SNNYOXD3","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One recommendation for the seller. Please include the instructions for the pump.  While one can look online for instructions, they should be included with the pump.  It is fairly easy to figure out how to reverse the stem.I have used this pump on both types of valve stems.  I deflated the tires all the way so I could determine how quickly I can fill the tires.  Filling up the tire on my road bike with the Presta valve was quick and easy.  The mountain bike tire with the Schrader was not as easy.  I had to push the tire so the stem would stay up as I attached the pump. Once attached the filling process did not take too long but you do get a better workout in.The pump comes with an attachment and screws to attach the pump to the bike.  Not sure if the attachment will hold the pump in place, if the pump is accidentally hit.  While it does grip the pump well, it does pop out fairly easily.  Thy did include velcro to giving it better holding power.  I mam using the velcro and plan to continue to use it.The build quality is good. my only concern is the lock lever feels a little loose.If you are looking for a low cost pump that handles both Presta and Schrader the BV pump will fulfill the requirement","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QE0OMOD9ZARG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDZQH0A#wasThisHelpful","R1QE0OMOD9ZARG","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used this speaker for about 1 month.  The sound is definitely better than the sound from laptop or phone. The sound is not full range. You mostly get mids and some highs.

The heat balance across the pots and pans is excellent.Cooking is easy with the pots and pans having the non-stick finish.  In order to test the non-stick surface, I made some over easy eggs.

In my opinion the Cree perform much better than GE.I cannot judge the life of the bulbs because I have not had any failures unlike the CFLs that I replaced.While LEDs are more expensive than CFLs, they are definitely worth it because they provide better light, do not contain mercury, and the life expectancy is better","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RENVSIRDG6R2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOSDYE4#wasThisHelpful","RENVSIRDG6R2Y","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I usually wait when a good deal with coupons for Proglides.If your are a Gillette user I would recommend moving up to the latest razor technology","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CSFGTK01G7VC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2APD0G#wasThisHelpful","R3CSFGTK01G7VC","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one heavy duty set.  It is replacing by Kitchedaid set that I have for more 15 years. (It served me well)  After cooking with these for a little more than a month I wonder why I never upgraded my starter set. I would expect this set to last me a long time.

"The storage drive with multiple functions market is becoming crowded and dependind on what are you trying to achieve this seagate may fill your need. I have had the drive for a couple of weeks now and this review based on my initial impression of this drive.  My first impression has not been goodSetup was easy. Power it on and plug into a port on the back of my router. Browse to the drive and go through the configuration, which allows you to setup your remote account for using the drive in the cloud.  The drive does not plug into your computer.The drive has a built in DLNA media server that scans the public folders on the drive looking for any media. I was able connect and stream a movie to my TV that is compliant with DLNA.  The movie was a DVD rip and there was no stuttering within my network. I did not test any further because I use Plex Media Server for streaming including streaming to my devices when they are outside of my network.Using the drive as a NAS works ok when connected to the gigabit switch.  I can get transfer speeds around 40MB/s.  When using the wifi the speeds are not too good. Averaging around 3.5MB/s in Wireless N network. (My router is a Netgear 4720)  I would have expected speeds in the 6MB/s range.As cloud storage it just did not work for me.  After the initial setup it worked for about an hour after that it stopped and never worked again for me.  I did a factory reset and when through the setup again but it still did not work.  My router fully supports UPNP and I use for Plex streaming. I eventually gave trying to get to work after a day. I have no issue with my Netgear ReadyCloud so I will stay with that.If you are in the market for a storage device that has DLNA and Cloud capabilities, I would not recommend this drive.  Maybe it is a software issue that can bee fixed by Seagate.  If anything change I will update my review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLP6D4IYR2Q0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARB5FPM#wasThisHelpful","RLP6D4IYR2Q0A","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had the Innova 3130c for a couple weeks now. Right out the box the scanner is easy to use and easy to read.  It comes with a nice carrying case and a quick start guide.  You will need to download the full guide because quick start guide does what states ""Gets you started with the scanner. The connector cord is long, which is a plus not having to stay close to the port. The scanner also has ABS, I see other reviewers posting about a fee for ABS.  I am not sure where they are being charged but I contacted Innova for clarification.  I was told there is no additional fee.  However, the scanner does not do airbags.I am not having any major issues with my car, so I cannot determine how well it works on major diagnostics or whether FixAssist works,  When doing the scanning while my car was running it did register some battery errors.As I get more usage from the scanner I will update my review.

"Excellent SSD drive with high read and write capacity.  Corsair / Micron have brought the market a good competitor to the Samsung 840.  It does not compete with the 840 pro line.  This is Multi-Layer Cell SSD, which should give you many years as a typical computer user.  One item to be aware of is that this SDD has a 3000 program erase cycles due to the smaller die.  The typical MLC ssd has 10000 program erase cycles.  At point it is hard to know the expected life of the drive but you would need to be doing a large amount of data cycles per day to impact the life of the drive.  There is a 3 year warranty so I would not hesitate buying this drive because of the great performance.I have had this drive in my laptop for three weeks.  I noticed a big performance boost with my Adobe Photoshop when working with larger files.  There was not much of a boost in battery life.  The i7 CPU and the 1080 screen kill the battery, so I am plugged in 90% of the time.  If you plan to replace your main system drive with this SSD, I would recommend using Macrium Reflect Free for cloning your drive.  The software is easy to use,This is my 4th SSD drive.  I have 2 - 128GB (Corsair / Kingston), 1 - 240GB (SanDisk),  I have been happy with all of them except Kingston.  It died in less than 3 months.  Once you make the change to SSD you will never want to go back other than for storage or where perfornace is not requred,I added an image from a read / write performance test that I ran.  Keep in mind if you have an older sata controller you will have the same performance results. If you are on the fence on whether to get this drive or the Samsung, I would say it comes down to cost.  Both Samsung and Corsair are top tier flash storage makers.I will update this review if anything changes as I get more usage,5 Stars / Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R62T8KTE02FKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQ8RHJ2#wasThisHelpful","R62T8KTE02FKP","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had the binding machine for couple of weeks now.  There are two important pieces of advice I would give to anyone new to a comb binding machine. First practice, practice, practice.  It is important to get have paper consistently  lined up as you punch groups of paper. If you are off by a little the edge of the paper will be too then and the paper will ripe out easily.  The second piece of advice do not bother with the book that comes in the box.  Go YouTube and watch the many videos on the product because is not very helpful.Once you have the hang of it you should enjoy it. One of the first books I created was the various drawings that our daughters have done over the years. I was punching 10 sheets at time to ensure I keep the pieces lined up.There is a tray to keep your extra combs in and it also as a guide to measure the thickness of your book to bound so you know the size of the comb to use.  Additionally, you need to keep the paper tray clean so the punch part continues to work well.I would recommend this product to friends and family. As I get more use with the product I will update my review and adjust the rating if need be.4 Stars Rating (-1 for poor documentation)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WRY1FL9NRNGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009FFXN4Q#wasThisHelpful","R1WRY1FL9NRNGX","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review based on using the Seagate Wireless Plus for a couple now.  I use it for videos and files storage for now. Having used and returning the GoFlex Satellite in the past, I can safely say Seagate has learned from their mistakes with that product.  Additionally, the overall look of the wireless plus is betterI have also used the Corsair Voyager Air and I would recommend the Seagate over the Corsair.  Corsair still has comes kinks to work out.Overview:No need to really go through what is in the box you can read that in the description.Transferring of video and larger  files via USB 3.0 is fast.  If you do not have any USB 3.0 ports the drive still works but the transfer is much slower.Seagate Wireless Plus has a DLNA server builtin so you can easily stream to your DLNA devices.Unlike the Corsair, Seagate does not have gigabit LAN port to this drive so it cannot be used as a standalone NAS.  I would assume most people looking to buy a Wifi hard drive are more interested in the streaming aspects of the drive.Seagate has a 10 hour battery life claim. I have not been on a long enough trip to prove otherwise.  I wish Seagate had added a battery life indicator with % left on the drive itself.  The Seagate Media App does provide a battery indicator with the app itself, which is great unless you are using a Windows laptop or tablet.Streaming:For my streaming test I used 4 different tablets.  1 - iPad, 1 - Windows 8 Pro tablet, and 1 - Android Tablets (10"")Connecting the WiFi. After turning on the drive and wifi all tablets found the network and I was able to connect to the driveSeagate provides an app for IOS and Android but not Windows 8.  You just map a drive to the drive in Windows.The APP has a good interface with thumbnail previews. Having the thumbnails are great when you have younger kids who do not read yet, he or she can start the movie based on the image.  However; this is the little annoynance, you have to put an image in the folder of the movies and most of the text within the file name has to match the name of file.  Seems easy enough but it also has to be large enough of a file or the drive completely ignores the image.  Then you add the fact if you have a large amount of video files that the time to do this for every video file adds up. Maybe Seagate can add the ability to do a media lookup to something like freebase when the drive is connected to the computer.You need to use Seagate's media app to change SSID and password of wifi network.  I high recommend you do both.I started the stream on all 3 tablets.The stream  worked well on all devices without dropping.  The Corsair would work for about 20 minutes then to drop all the devices and happened multiple times.While I do not know product roadmap, one can assume Corsair will address any bugs that are discovered with a software update.I would recommend Seagate Wireless Plus to family and friendsI rate the device 4 1/2 stars.  I will update review and ratings if anything changes with this drive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YC3RCLJ5ZZ5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQRUW4Q#wasThisHelpful","R2YC3RCLJ5ZZ5E","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review based on using the Corsair Voyager Air for a few weeks now.  I use it for videos and files storage for now. My one line thought is, The product has the potential to be great but unfortunately Corsair may have brought it to the market before it was ready to be released.That being said the product is still good but if you are looking to buy now with a product that just works then consider the Seagate wireless plus drive.  If you are no rush and you can take a wait see approach with what Corsair will do with software update then maybe take a chance with this drive.Overview:No need to really go through what is in the box you can read that in the description.  The setup is straight forward; however, my newer Dell laptop would not recognize the drive without restarting.  Plugging the drive into your computer also charges the drive.Transferring of video and larger  files via USB 3.0 is fast.  If you do not have any USB 3.0 ports the drive still works but the transfer is much slower.Corsair added a gigabit LAN port to this drive so be added to your network as a NAS.  Seagate wireless plus does not have this option.  This option is not a selling point for me because the streaming feature is what I use the drive for.The drive does not have a DLNA server builtin like the Seagate Wireless PlusStreaming:For my streaming test I used 4 different tablets.  1 - iPad, 1 - Windows 8 Pro tablet, and 2 - Android Tablets (7"" and 10"")Connecting the WiFi. After turning on the drive and wifi all tablets found the network.  Unfortunately, none of the tablets would browse the drive after connecting to the network.  I had to turn each device off and back on before I could browse the drivesCorsair provides an app for IOS and Android but not Windows 8.  You just map a drive to the Voyager air in Windows.The APP is a basic file browser and very intuitive at all but gets the job done. If you have younger kids who do not read yet  who will select the movies for them.  Have thumbnail images for younger children would be great if Corsair decides to add that in an update.  The APP kept crashing on the 7"" Dell Streak, so I could not test it on there.You also need to use the app to set the wireless password for the deviceI started the stream on all 3 tablets.  The devices were all within 5 feet.  I tested around 20 feet within the same room and the stream still worked.The stream was going well for about 20 minutes until the voyager decided to drop all the devices.  Even though the blue wifi signal on the drive still showed blue none of the tablets saw the network.  I turned off the wifi and back on but the network still did not show up.  The drive was fully charged so I shut it off for 10 minutes and then back on and I was able to see the network again.  The movie starts over and not from where you left off.  After about 20 minutes the same problem occurred.  It is possible the drive is not handling multiple streams very well.  I have not yet tried streaming with only one device because my Seagate Wireless Plus work fine with multiple streams.  As a note I put all my videos in iPADs M4V format because it supported by most players and it keeps the iPAD happyWhile I do not know product roadmap, one can assume Corsair will address any bugs that are discovered with a software update.I would not recommend this over the Seagate Wireless Plus. As mentioned before if the NAS is a must then the Seagate will not work with being connect to a computer to share the storage.I rate the device 2 1/2 stars.  I wish I could give 2 1/2 instead of 2 or 3.

"Being able to move away from using the computer for the Skype to the TV is a great upgrade.  Sure the price tag to do this is steep to buy a niche product.Please ensure you have an open HDMI port for this or invest in a HDMI switch.  Between gaming consoles, media players, cable boxes, and bluray players HDMI are filled quicklyThe setup is straight forward, put the camera on top of your tv with the include holder, plug in the power, and the HDMI port.  You can use the LAN or Wifi Connection for the network.All the configuration is done with the included remote. Once logged into your Skype account, you select the person you wish to have a video call with and start the call.  Unfortunately, you can not do a group video only voice. Hopefully Logitech can make it possible in the future with a software update.  Additionally, there is no screen share or IM, which is understandable with the product being made for a TV.The video quality is surprisingly good for the TV, there is some pixelation in the video. My family is able to sit on our couch that is out 10 feet away from the camera and our parents are able to clearly see all of us at once. I have encountered some drops in the video but that could be a network issue on my parent side.  I would assume if your internet speeds are not very good you may experience issues with video performance.  The microphone does a good job picking up our voices as we talk.  I have not experienced any echo effect,  which suggests he noise cancellation that is built-in worksWith Skype being the largest consumer video call/chat I understand why Logitech targeted only Skype with the camera.  However, I wish it also supported Google.  This would cover all my video call needs.We enjoy the product and would recommend it to friends and family because you un-tether yourself from the computer.

"Brief BackgroundPhotography is a hobby for me; however, taking  great photos is important to me. Having the right gear is a must for creating great photosI have had various cameras over the years.  My last 4 have all been Digital SLRs.  My current camera is Canon 5D MKIII.The Fuji HS50 sits between a standard point and shoot and a digital SLR. The camera has an equivalent 24-1000mm zoom(42x) and includes image stabilization. The 16MP Sensor.  The sensor is 1/2 size, allows Fuji to reach the  long range of the lens. The f stop range is 2.8 to 5.6. The camera has a built-in flash.  The camera can do 11fps when shooting in jpeg mode. There is a microphone socket so you can add an external mic for video.I have used the camera for a month so my review is based on my initial impressions.  As I have more usage, I will update by review from time to time.Indoors:The first thing I noticed with my first couple of shots indoors was how fast the camera focused and the speed of the shutter.  I was shooting at 24mm and 800ISO with no flash during the mid afternoon. The quality of the photo were good. The noise on the images was not overwhelming, which will allow for larger prints.  Once I started using the longer range on the lens the photos started to getting to soft. The colors were no longer popping. Still acceptable for 8x10 prints.  When using the flash indoors I had to dial it down a little because they pictures were a little blown out. The flash did restore some quality to photo. The camera is above average indoors as long as you have enough light.  I did test the camera at 1000X indoors and there was some bokeh within the pictures. Not a large amount but that is expected at 5.6. At 1600 iso there is too much noise on the photos, you will need to cleanup the photo if you plan to use 1600 unless noise does not bother you.Outdoors:Being able to lower the ISO really helps the camera excel.  I was impressed by the  zoom.  While does take a little longer to focus at 1000mm, I was amazed by going from wide to zoomed.  The photos do suffer at the 1000mm but there are usable to print.  I will post some samples of wide to zoom.  As I have already mentioned the camera is fast so you will be able to capture the kids running around without motion blur.  I also used the camera to take macro photo of flowers and a lizard that happen to walk by.  The photos turned out well but you get much better images with the SLR and Macro Lens.Other features I have not tried yet is the panoramic mode and taking video. You can do a 360 panoramic.  I will update my review once I had the opportunity to try the features.I would definitely recommend this camera to friends and family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T7X342BGOBE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATM1MGA#wasThisHelpful","R1T7X342BGOBE8","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not sure why Kingston did not add a USB 3.0 port when they added the 128GB to Wi-Drive family.  They also used the older mini usb instead of the micro usb. Seems like the engineers did nothing to improve the Wi-Drive other adding more storage. That being said the drive does do a good adding extra storage to my tablet via wifi.Because the drive is small they had to make the internal battery small, which I get around 3 1/2 hours battery life.Personally I would recommend looking at the Seagate Wireless Plus or the corsair voyager if you do not mind the larger size.  The battery life is better and you get more storage.Where Kingston shines is when you are traveling for business and you need the extra storage in your meetings but do not want the larger footprint.  With Apple keeping the iPad lockdown and not adding a microsd slot, it is nice to be able to store additional videos on the Wi-Drive.The videos play smoothly on the IPad.  The kids have a better selection of movies on road trips now.While I recommend the Wi-Drive, I would looking at the Seagate or Corsair first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IEPO8JXQ4FJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AI922DQ#wasThisHelpful","R2IEPO8JXQ4FJ3","A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This shower handle is pretty helpful. Its fairly easy to install, it'll stick to any flat and smooth surface. You can attach it to the wall of your shower or to the edge of you tub. It attaches to surfaces using suction cups, and tells you if you attached them correctly thanks to two small indicators. The indicators turn from red to blue when the suction cups have been firmly attached, once they're attached you'll have to lock it by using the blue switches on each cup. The handle has some kind of spring mechanism built in that keeps the suction cups from losing their suction. however I recommend that you reattach the handle from time to time just to make sure it still has it's grip. The handle has either a silicone or a rubber grip on it to prevent your hand from slipping off when its wet or soapy. When attaching the handle I recommend to not place the suction cup over the grout lines between tiles (If you have them) as this will weaken the suction cups strength or make it so they can't attach at all. The handle is pretty strong, it can hold quite a bit of weight. You can hang items off of it like wash cloths or shower caddies. Overall this is a great product for showers and is helpful for keeping your balance while washing your feet or getting in/out of your tub/shower.Free product  in exchange of an unbiased honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JUZDF1F4Z92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01258UYJG#wasThisHelpful","R2JUZDF1F4Z92","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a few cutting boards that I use regularly but I was looking for something smaller and something that would not move when I use it.These Acrylic Polypropylene Plastic boards fit my needs to a tee. I usually cut fruit in the morning for a smoothie and I can use the smallest board. My daughter can also use this as I know it won't slide and it will be easier for her to use. These lie flat on my countertop and they wash very nicely. I think the red around the white of the board looks attractive so I can also serve celery sticks and such on them too. I like the ""juice"" grove so that if I move the board, water from washing fruits and vegy's don't spill on the counter.

"This headlight is awesome! It is incredibly bright for being so small. When it arrived it came in a nice little box. I quickly read the instructions to fully understand it's features and put 3 AAA batteries into it and turned it on. I was surprised at how bright it was! The light goes really far, and even further if you focus it. The lamp has a few different modes which you can switch through by pressing the power button repeatedly, there is Glare Mode, which is its brightest setting. Low Mode, which is slightly dimmer than Glare Mode and Flash Mode which makes the light blink very quickly. Flash Mode would be useful if you needed to get someone's attention if you got lost while camping. All three of these modes can also be performed by the two red lights. You can turn the red lights on by holding the power button down for a few seconds; switching between modes the same way as the white light. The red lights are very dim compared to the white light and they don't go as far so I don't see much use for them. The white light can also be focused, this concentrates the spotlight into a smaller size but makes it brighter. The lamp is water proof, it can operate in the rain but the instructions say not to submerge it in water. The headlight is quite comfortable to wear and the band is adjustable. The lamp is also pretty durable, it can be dropped from a short distance and still function normally. Overall I think this lamp would be great for emergencies working in ill lighted places like under the sink and if you like to go camping and spelunking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCP4P194WE0QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016MRRDUY#wasThisHelpful","RCP4P194WE0QR","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This oil diffuser works great. It's fairly simple to use, just plug it into a wall outlet and insert the power cord into the back of the base, twist the diffuser onto the base, add water and oil and it's ready to go! The diffuser's light turns on when it is working, the light changes color which is kind of cool. If you want to turn the diffuser off, you can unplug it from the wall or twist it off of the base. I used a few different kinds of diffuser oil with this product and I found that depending on thickness of the oil or how much you put in, you'll need to add more water accordingly. I found that using a 1/2 a teaspoon (2.5 mL) of oil and 1 cup (240 mL) of water seems to work best for most oils. But you're free to experiment a little with the measurements as you may want the odor of the oil to be more potent or less potent, depending on your preference. I also found that mixing the oil and water before adding it to the diffuser allows it to create more mist. I think it's best to put the oil and water in a bottle or jar and shake it to mix it. Mixing the oil and water together breaks the oil into small droplets which are more easily turned into mist. The diffuser creates quite a lot of mist, however, most of the mist seems to pool up inside the diffuser, despite this it's able to fill a small room with fragrance in a few minutes, especially if a fan is present and on. It's also very quiet. If left to unused for awhile the oil may separate from the water and either sit on the surface or the bottom. Some oils with dyes or color in them may stain the inside of the diffuser, I haven't tried to remove the stains from my diffuser so I don't know if they're permanent or not. The diffuser will turn itself off if the water level gets to low, but this hasn't happened often for me as it takes a long time for all of the water and oil to be used and I often refill it before it gets too low. If it's not turning on when you want it to then try adding more water and oil. Make sure not to overfill the diffuser as it won't be able to produce mist. If the diffuser is used for a long period of time it may get hot, I recommend only turning it on for 3.5 hours or less.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10SZD706R99ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011SBCSYA#wasThisHelpful","R10SZD706R99ZH","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While reading this I was pretty frustrated and kinda mad with the ending. I could not make myself like the main character, Estelle.Her husband Jack and father of Mia, from what was revealed wasn't much and not likeable. Getting to know Estelle was exhausting; from her emotional turmoils and self revelations, for me it wasn't intriguing reading, it was annoying. There was some plot holes here and I guess they don't matter because it would have just been more exasperating to read. I did appreciate the different take on premise of the plot and the complexity of the storyline, however, my dislike for the character overshadowed that.The ending here,literally the last page, validated how I fell all along and overall why I didn't like Estelle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3022JDGZIVS1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425278409#wasThisHelpful","R3022JDGZIVS1Y","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book by Wendy Corsi Staub. I have always wanted to read a book by her and I was glad that this bookwas available from Vine. Blood Red is the first of a trilogy with the setting of Mundy's Landing, which is a character on its own. Mundy'sLanding has an interesting history behind it which makes for a great backdrop. The writing here is so good too, like a comfort read; great setting, good characters,  and a good mystery to be resolved.The characters here are also very interesting and likeable. Although I couldn't relate to Rowan's dilemma at all,I was still reeledin by the suspenseful writing and wondering how Casey tied into the story. This had a satisfying reveal and conclusion and I am certainly interested in reading the upcoming books in the trilogy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D91S3K4CBQ7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062349732#wasThisHelpful","R3D91S3K4CBQ7M","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this water flosser, it works well. It's very simple to use, it has three settings, normal, soft and pulse. When I use this flosser, I tend to use the soft setting as the pulse and normal setting hurt if I accidentally shoot my gums or the inner cheek of my mouth. I found that when using this flosser, it's best to hold it a small distance away from the area you're trying to clean. Also, I recommend using this with your mouth closed as leaving it open will get water everywhere. It does a good job cleaning the plaque off my teeth however it's not too good at removing food that gets stuck between my teeth... Its battery lasts awhile on a single charge so that's good. It does run out of water quickly so you'll have to refill it at least once if you want to do a thorough cleaning. Refilling the flosser is a simple task, you can either remove the blue tank on the back of the device and fill it up or leave it attached and fill the tank by using the small white lid on the top of the flosser. It comes with two replaceable heads so you can share it with someone or keep both heads for yourself in case one gets dirty or damaged. Overall, a good product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROG8ABIUHTIBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9BRHGY#wasThisHelpful","ROG8ABIUHTIBJ","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Be Safe I love You is a very well written fast paced novel. I think that Lauren is one of the most interesting and unique characters that I have read about in quite awhile. Cara Hoffman is adept at reeling you in and keeping you there; making you feel the turmoil that Lauren felt.One thing I did have trouble with was with the character of Lauren's father and being a psychologist and not realizing he had depression to the point where he didn't provide for his family? In turn causing Lauren that much more chaos, stress and responsibility at a young age which added to whatever pressures and instability she felt coming back from war.Overall though, I liked this story and I am left wanting to read Hoffman's first novel, So Much Pretty.I am definitely keeping my eye on this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WQA4OL8WN0KH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451641311#wasThisHelpful","R1WQA4OL8WN0KH","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this lamp. When I got the lamp I had to do some assembling, however that was a simple task. It comes with instructions to help you with assembly. I had to screw on the metal lamp shade and put the clamp together and install the light bulb that came packaged with the lamp. The lamp attaches to objects using a clamp, the clamp can attach to a flat surface that is approximately 4 centimeters in width. You can attach the clamp to both horizontal and vertical surfaces and the lamp will stay. The clamp also has a good grip, I shook a small table that the lamp was attached to to test out it's grip and the lamp didn't fall, which is good as you won't have to worry about knocking the lamp over. The lamp is somewhat flexible, you can position it almost anyway you want. You can tighten and loosen the joints. However, a gooseneck would provide even more flexibility.

"This is a powerful steamer! I like to keep this outside my closet for quick steamingbefore wearing an item from my closet.The steam setting is adjustable with four settings. I prefer the highest setting for most of my items and this Ivation steamerreally makes those wrinkles disappear! I also used this on some of my fabric stash to get out the folded wrinkles before sewing.If you need or want those crisp edges and lines, of course you will need an iron. The steam is very hot, over 200 degrees. I steamed severalyards of fabric and I still had plenty of water in the tank for more. The best outcome in using this steamer was to make sure the garment(fabric) was hanging and to take a slow swipe down the fabric. The slower, the better the results and then I didn't have to go over the fabric again.Also, remember that the nozzle and hose needs to be going down not sideways or upside down. The steam is continuous that way.

"This garlic press is heavy stainless-steel. I wouldn't be surprised if it lasted the rest of my life. The weight allows it to crush garlic with minimal effort. The sieve swings out from the masher (and it's stainless steel) which makes it easy to clean. Sometimes, when pressing several cloves in a row, some garlic will come up and out past the masher instead of through the sieve. Not a deal breaker, as it only happens when their is sufficient build-up. The pressed garlic also sticks to the sieve - but I imagine that's a ""problem"" with just about any garlic press. If you're looking for a basic garlic press, this is definitely a solid choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38PF2TCQJ5GTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKJE0SG#wasThisHelpful","R38PF2TCQJ5GTV","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This light works pretty well! It uses three AAA batteries which come packaged with the light. I tested this light all around my house, I looked for things that might be dirty or things that just look cool when the light is on them. The light works best in the dark or when held close to a surface or object so it's best to use this at night or with the blinds shut. I found that dust usually glows green or a light blue when under the black light. I also found a few stains on my carpeting using the black light. I suppose my puppy had been secretly going pee on the carpeting, (the pee stains glow greenish) I cleaned the stains as soon as I found them.

"I want to preface this review by saying up front that if you are looking to future proof yourself for 4k entertainment early on, this is the AVR you need to buy. At the writing of this review, the Onkyo 646 is the ONLY AVR on the market that uses HDMI 2.0 allowing 40 at 60 Hz AND HDCP 2.2. This is extremely important if you plan on investing in a 4k tv now and do not want to buy a new AVR later.This AVR was a big upgrade for me and something I have been waiting to purchase. I was using an out of the box home theater set up from Onkyo as my current AVR. I could tell it was not giving my speakers the power they needed as I have been slowly upgrading my living room sound system.  I am currently using;Front: Bowers and Wilkins CM 9sCenter: Bowers and Wilkins CM Centre S2Rear: Cheap out of the box Onkyos I do not know what they areSubwoofer: SVS PB-1000To fully test this AVR I had to order the SVS PB-1000 online right then and there because I did not have a powered Subwoofer. THIS AVR ONLY ALLOWS A POWERED SUBWOOFER. YOU CANNOT USE A PASSIVE SUBWOOFER WITH THIS AVR. I got the  SVS PB-1000 because research told me it's the best sub for $500. I felt like that was a good price point for me.I first ran Onkyo’s calibration set up with the provided Mic. This only took five minutes. Once complete the difference between my AVRs was night and day. I “feel” the sound better; it blew me away! Everything was crystal clear and smooth. Everything had depth and power. This is really awesome equipment!While I do think the calibration set up may have under-powered my center, a quick adjustment in the menu was not a problem.The features on here are pretty self explanatory and I did not need the instructions to find what I wanted to do. I easily connected it to my home Wi-fi network. I logged in with my Pandora account and everything worked as it should. I have to admit it’s easier to just use your phone and the Bluetooth option to stream anything that way you can change the songs from any room.Some things I do not like about this device are:If I turn on the TV the AVR will shut off too. I then have to go and turn the AVR back on if I want to listen to music without the TV being on any more.The boot time on this AVR is long. It takes at least a minute for it to “initialize”. This collides with the problem above.All around for the price features and amount of inputs this is the most solid AVR I have seen at this price point and a must have if you are adopting 4k soon.If you have any questions, post in the comments and I will respond as soon as I can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29FFYUCFEQ27T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WM1V9KU#wasThisHelpful","R29FFYUCFEQ27T","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This wig looks very natural when fitted properly and the hair itself doesn't have a shine that makes it look like plastic. The feel of it though is stretchy and artificial. There are no bald or patchy spots on this wig which I really like.  Its very long and heavy; it feels full and also gets kind of hot.The inside of the wig cap is has a strap and hook that makes it adjustable to your head size. Its very nice and once on properly I don't feel it coming off.The bangs are nice and very cute when combed to the side. Since this wig though is so long I found it kind of hard to manage. It would tangle easy and would be difficult to un-knot. It sheds a lot when brushed but can actually be brushed out.I love how natural the pale blonde part is and the other colors are very nice too. It has a very nice peachy orange, a cotton candy blue, lavender and mint green. It looks very pretty when braided!Overall I find this wig to be really fun and colorful.

"I like these lanterns because they are bright and very portable. However the LEDs in these lanterns are placed so that they are exposed, meaning if you look at the lantern the light could hurt your eyes. I wish the LEDs were covered by a piece of white translucent plastic, this would give them a soft glow and they'd no longer be harmful to your eyes. They are small so you can easily pack them into a bag to take camping or store them in a closet, ready in case of a power outage. They use four AA batteries, but they last a long time especially if you're using good batteries. They also have a handle with a curve in the center, this is so you can hang the lantern from a hook and it'll stay balanced.

I like its compact design, it makes it portable so it's easy to pack into a bag to take camping. It is also very light weight. It has two metal handles on the top which fold to it's sides for easy storage. The compass, which is built into the top of the lantern is pretty nice although it becomes inaccurate if the lantern is shaken or unbalanced which is annoying when you're trying use it while walking. This problem can be fixed if you set the lantern down on a flat surface or hold it steady for a few seconds, so it isn't too bothersome.

A small clip to I guess keep your cord together, the charger; and a huge variety of ear hooks.The ear hooks help to keep the buds inside of your ear when you're moving around. They do not irritate my ears at all or feel uncomfortable in any way, and I can wear these for a couple hours.I think the ear hooks are amazing, there are different sizes to choose from so you can pick which your most comfortable with, not to mention they look cool. I can swing my head back and forth to the beat without losing an earbud, (something that would happen with my normal earbuds.) So these are perfect for runners, people who workout at the gym or do yoga.Or if your just sitting at a desk and don't want to bother with the ear hooks, you can leave them out and the buds fit snug into your ears normally. Though the buds have some weight to them compared to normal earbuds, so its why I always prefer to have the hooks in.Overall everything is comfortable and fits snug ONCE I can fit it perfectly into my ears. It did take me a while to get used to using these earbuds. At first I really struggled with the ear hooks fitting in at the right angle and not have everything slide out which was annoying. But after wearing these buds so often and playing around with them; I've gotten used to it and everything is fine.I love these Bluetooth headphones, honestly. There is no annoying cord that gets caught on everything when I'm maneuvering. I hang the cord behind my neck and its no bother at all. I can leave my phone in my pocket with no cord hanging out or I can leave my phone on my desk and go about my house with no disconnection of any kind.These charged pretty quickly and lasted for a good 5 hours. For the compact size that's not too bad. Connecting them to my phone via Bluetooth was quick and simple. Once holding down the power button there is a voice that will tell you ""power on"" or ""power off"" or when the battery is low.There is a protective flap on the left bud that reveals the charging port. On the right ear bud there is a mic, the volume buttons and a ""qyc"" logo to pause the music or take a call.I love these features! Without having to reach for my phone I can raise or lower the volume, or hold the volume button to change the song playing or even pause the song. The headphones make listening to music while out so much nicer. I can take a call without holding my phone because of the mic built in, and the person on the other end can hear me quite clearly.These earbuds have the best quality of music I have experienced out of all of my normal earbuds. (jbuds as an example of other buds I've used.) It blew my mind. It can get pretty loud, which I love and the earbuds themselves block out noise really well, making the music more clearly heard. They're great!Overall I am excited to use these to listen to my music from now on. I love not having to deal with a cord, not having to reach for my phone to change the song, how comfortable and tangle-free these are; and the quality is impressive! I'm raving about them to my friends and I highly recommend them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R128JYAQQU4KD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP6CFEC#wasThisHelpful","R128JYAQQU4KD8","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found these walking/ trekking poles to be extremely useful and helpful to me during my outings.I see that they definitely help propel me forward, increasing my speed and efficiency. I feel more secure withmy footing and they have helped stabilize me. My walking party always accuses me of being too slow. I now do not have thatlabel any longer. These poles are sturdy, easy to extend and have a great grip, the straps are wonderful too.I also like the travel bag so that the poles stay clean and together when I am not using them.I like to use the one pole also when I am shopping, I have often miss- stepped almost tripping and these help me walk moresecurely and confidently.I am very grateful for receiving these in exchange for my unbiased review.

"When I picked this I thought I was getting an origami set and I was so excited! However this ""amigami"" isn't the same as the paper folding art, origami.This set comes with two figures, a penguin and a polar bear. The figures come with accessories such as stickers and pop out pieces of glossy paper to decorate with. I'd like to add that the figures are hollow plastic so they're very lightweight but sturdy.What you do is pop out a shape from the glossy paper designs; in my case a pair of wing shapes for my penguin figure, and take one of the many star pegs provided to poke through one of the holes already made through the glossy paper and right into the figure. Each figure has hole placements on the top of the head, the sides for arms, the front of the chest and the behind for tails. Another option are stripes of glossy paper that you curl around a stick piece provided in the kit and make curly accessories such as a tail or curly ears. You don't necessarily need the curling-stick to curl your paper pieces, as you can do it by hand. But it is very helpful because there is somewhere to hook your glossy paper onto so it'll hold as you wrap the paper around as it curls.These are a lot of fun decorating but I have to say they are very colorful with the designs. There aren't any solid color pieces and to me it can look like there is just too much going on. They definitely aren't boring looking! I wish the sets had more pegs, a few solid colored pieces and perhaps an extra hole placement for added crazy decoration fun.I  definitely think this can provide and spark creativity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EQJNC9I5AGZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M5AT31U#wasThisHelpful","R1EQJNC9I5AGZT","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The writing in Whiskey and Charlie is very well done.  With two interesting and unique characters and with them being twins I wasimmediately drawn into the story. I am a twin and I always like to read anything with a twin theme.I found Whiskey and Charlie to be one of those rare reads that I could read in one sitting. It was emotional, there were many tears shed during this reading.

My husband had no troubles closing it though.I love that this came with a matching case and that has a handle.

"While I was reading this book, I had a lot of mixed feelings. The characters were so well developed both in character and dialogue that I was moved from liking to hating to not being sure how I felt. This whole book but especially the ending is certainly food for thought.The only real problem I had was several times the storyline became tiresome and a bit tedious.I love character driven novels and in this one I wanted to shake them, all of them, at one time or another. Clearly mental illness was involved here but when it isn't properly addressed or ignored it just makes for a frustrating read.Usually, characters that frustrate/(pmo) tend to make me not like a book but here for some reason I can't put my finger on, did not however I was left irritated.This book will move you and it will definitely be great for discussions.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GFVKHR36FASI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525427422#wasThisHelpful","R3GFVKHR36FASI","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love reading Linwood Barclay's books. I know that I am guaranteed in depth characters that are likeable and a solid plot.In Broken Promise, there is several mysteries going on that​we are made aware of. The main topic here is that David Harwood has come back to Promise Falls to raise his son near his parents.David has a past that is hinted at but we don't get the full back story.David visits his younger cousin to find her taking care of a child, one she calls her own but as David and all in town know, her child was born stillborn, a tragedy Marla is still coming to terms with a year later.Who is this child and what happened to his mother?​After a few chapters in I noticed that this book had me feeling a familiarity. When I finished I realized this has a bit-just a bit, of a similarity to Linwood Barclay's first novels involving Zack Walker. Maybe because he was a reporter too, whatever it is, this has that kind of humor; light and sporadic which is what I love about the Walker series. Which makes this different than the last several Barclay books.As I mentioned earlier, mysteries abound in this novel and I was really excited that the ending  (not Marla's story) was a cliffhanger and we will get to read about t​hese characters again in the next book in this character series.I can't wait!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10279ZOJR9Q71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451472675#wasThisHelpful","R10279ZOJR9Q71","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To start using the mouse, plug it in to a USB port. The mouse will start working right away, so there is no need to install the software to make the mouse function. The software is only used to customize the mouse. There are plenty of options for customization, you can change the color of the lights on the front of the mouse, in the wheel and the in Turtle Beach logo. You can make the lights any color you'd like. Except black, the light just turns off when you turn it to black... You can also change what all the buttons do on the mouse, you can set buttons to control a media player, so they could adjust volume, pause and play etc. You can also set buttons to act like keys on a key board, you could set a button to act like the shift key or control key, which could be useful for editing or playing games. You can also set a button on the mouse to open a application/program/game, so you can open your favorite application/program/game with just the press of a button without having to find it buried some where in your computer. You can also adjust the speed of the mouse. You can save up to 5 different customized profiles. So you can have one profile for editing, another for gaming and another for browsing the web. I kinda wish there was a setting that'd let you quickly change between profiles but the best way to do that would probably be to set a button to open the customization software and change the profile there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU5ROY8FDQLBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8BL0FI#wasThisHelpful","RU5ROY8FDQLBE","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I had a great time getting to know the Gillespies.I fell in love with all the characters and I wish I had neighbors just like them.The depictions of the surroundings was done so well, I felt like I was on vacation in South Australian outback. What really kept me reading was the relationships within the Gillespie family. Also, an intregal part of the story, close family friend, Joan who addded the down to earth advice and Aunt Celia who added just enough spice.For me, this was a true feel good entertaining read.

"Overall, I liked reading the perspectives of the Campbell family after the return of Justin and their reflection of how they dealt with him missing.The novel is well written as a character driven novel; the characters were three dimensional and portrayed realistically. Even with all this I did still find this novel dragging a bit. I would have liked to have read less about what the parents were thinking instead of what actually happened to Justin and his four year captivity. Not nitty gritty details but maybe more of what Justin was thinking then and how he was dealing with coming home now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BBORB83VVW1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400062128#wasThisHelpful","R1BBORB83VVW1U","A1H1BPKUMGVIA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H1BPKUMGVIA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is a little off the wall, and probably not something you’d expect to receive, but it would probably be something random enough to make an impression on someone if you were all out of gift ideas.It is also the perfect thing to bring along on a camping trip, or to a backyard barbecue with a fire-pit.  (I like the idea that it is purely self-contained, and you don’t have to rummage about in your pantry for the separate ingredients… no, “oh shoot, I thought we had marshmallows!” to spoil your outing.)And, you know what? If you are like me and it is highly unlikely you are going to go camping in the near future you can always use this as the “I-am-so-hungry-there-has-GOT-to-be-some-emergency-junk-food-in-this-house-stash”  I mean, it comes with EIGHTEEN candy bars.THAT said, it seems WAY overpriced to me.  You could have made it and sold it for $20, so I don’t think it is a very cost effective package.  Buy the ingredients separately if you just want to make smores, but consider buying this box if you want to present it as a gift.And yes, you can make smores in the Microwave.

"This is a decent crock pot.  The one thing that it missed which I would have liked, perhaps, would have been a small red LED light so I could tell at a glance that it was on.  Otherwise you have to wait until it starts heating to know that you are good to go.Other than that, I thought it worked pretty well.  It was very easy to clean –I just take out the center bowl and the glass top and put them both right into the dishwasher to do most of the work.One other item which I hadn’t seen before that was actually pretty cool was that the glass lid has handles on both sides.  This appears to be so that you can turn the lid over to lower the vertical height further, if you need just that little extra bit of space in order to squeeze it into the fridge.  Nice touch!I also like the design.  My other crock pot has a stainless steel finish, but this one looks nicer, perhaps because it is so different.

"I like to use these bags for larger jobs.  I can usually deal with medium sized bags for most everyday use, but once in a while I need to do some serious cleanup, OR, I want to seal something up to make it somewhat airtight (like a car seat I need to store, or an out of season wreath), so that I may keep it in the basement which is exposed to a lot dust and dirt.  For these types of uses these bags are fantastic.They also have a ribbon drawstring which allows you to tighten the heck out of it and reduce the opening to mostly nothing.  (No complaints here! They are real drawstrings, and not just extended ends which some other bags have instead of the separate drawstrings.)However, one thing I was slightly disappointed by was that these were not as durable as I thought they’d be.  These are definitely NOT contractor bags.  Contractor bags are very large, and very thick, and are used for getting rid of debris that you might encounter during home renovations, for example.  They pretty much resist poking and ripping, and are a great catch all for drywall, plaster, or wire mesh.  THESE bags are NOT those.  They don’t appear to be any thicker that your standard garbage bag, which is not a bad thing, I just want to point out that they are not “industrial strength”.  If you want that, buy “contractor” bags instead (like “Hefty Heavy Duty Contractor Bags”), and I guarantee that you’ll be thrilled at the thickness and durability of those bags, if you have a rougher job than just everyday use.That one item aside, I recommend these bags.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A1D9Q6AKIFNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBGVMW4#wasThisHelpful","R3A1D9Q6AKIFNA","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually shy away from polyester blankets, but I have to say that this one grew on me.The first thing I did was to throw it into the wash, and then on a low dry cycle, because I was most worried about 'shedding' or 'pilling', and figured I wanted to know right away if I was going to eventually be disappointed after I cleaned it, and it started to fall apart.However, after drying it and checking the lint screen and the blanket before and after I have to say that I had nothing to be disappointed about.  There was no more shedding than usually occurs with regular clothes, and the blanket still looked brand new -thank goodness.Once that was out of the way I was able to appreciate it for what it was -a pretty durable, and versatile throw blanket, perfect for a cold night, watching TV, ALONE, with a bowl of ice cream.  (It is too small for two, but perfect for one!)But seriously, I rather like that you've got two completely different sides to this blanket.  One side is more like a shag rug, and it is luxuriously silky and tactile, while the other side is a more conservative darker color, without the deep pile.  So, you really can choose from two completely different experiences.By the way, I imagine if you have pets, you are going to have to hide this blanket, because if you leave it 'deep pile up' your pets are going to find this immediately, and live on it, and you are never going to be able to use it again.  It is that soft and comfortable (and reflecting of heat, since it is polyester).I actually liked this.  My only complaint is that I would have liked it a bit larger, so it could be more useful for two, instead of for one.

"I had never used this type of product before and didn't know what to expect.  Once I took the rolls out of the plastic, however, I was overwhelmed by the strong scent that just wafted everywhere.  It was so pervasive that it overpowered everything in my storage room (while on the floor) until I moved it to the top of the shelves.I was turned off by the strong scent and would have much rather had an unscented option, but there you go.Anyway, aside from that, it worked pretty well. I was able to use one sheet, add a little water, and do some good cleaning.  I can see the appeal if you don't use cleaning wipes but don't want to dirty a dishcloth.

"Though a bit pricey (I think) this is a relatively durable and thoughtfully designed outdoor-oriented garment which should please your backyard explorer with its versatility and carryability-of-things-found-and-picked-up! (I know that I am always being asked to hold rocks for my child, and I am happy to give that opportunity back to him –go ahead, load on up, as much as you want, as long as YOU carry it!)The vest is relatively versatile.  It has seven small straps that you can tie things to (though I am not sure I’d want much swinging against my side when walking) but the IDEA of the straps is a good one.It also has four pockets with which to hold all your backyard or nature walk finds.Next, it has a zipper for easy/on, easy/off performance and the entire back is made of mesh to allow breathability and prevent overheating.  (I found this to be really important because no one wants to drape their child in canvas when going outside on a hot summer day…)It is a pretty simple idea, and executed reasonably well.  Keep in mind that no other items come with the vest –no magnifying glass, and no binoculars –so if you want to gift this vest you may want to purchase one or two of those items on your own and include them, to make it more functional.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y5EWCWBYM886/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UUS462A#wasThisHelpful","R2Y5EWCWBYM886","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this book, and it actually fascinates my 2 year old as well.  For the past week he has asked me to read it to him every night.  (“Daddy, read Princess and Po-ny!”)At first he just wanted to listen to the words. Now he actively scans the more detailed pages (with a lot going on in the background) and points at items (like things hanging on a wall) and asks questions.  “what’s that?” (“uh, a poster of 3 warriors”) What’s that? (“a picture of her mommy and daddy”), “what’s that?” (“ah, I guess it is a couple of ticket takers at the battle event.”) Does he understand it all? No, he is a little young for this, but he enjoys it nonetheless.So that is my first comment.  The backgrounds are lush and detailed.  A lot of care went into them, and they are fun to scan and find supporting story artifacts –like what sweaters are people wearing? What does the princess have in her bedroom? What are all the warriors doing during the big battle?Second, the book is pretty funny.  Having no prior knowledge of the author I didn’t know what to expect, and I found the book to be slightly dry and absurdist –which felt just about right for the young children reading this book.  I did worry a little bit about the presumed violence that is mentioned and shown in one panel, but aside from that bit of awkwardness, everything works out in the end and it turns out to be a fun, well written story, which fights traditional stereotypes and which I feel will be a nice addition once again when my children are a little older and will ‘get’ different aspects of the book which are mysterious at present.Finally, I like how the book doesn’t talk down to children.  There is a good use of vocabulary in the book, and a couple of words I know I won’t be teaching them for years –but why not start early?This book makes a nice gift as it is not traditional, and is quirky and fun.

"I probably wouldn’t buy this for a professional/tradesman who would use this as their primary tool, but for a normal tool around the house guy this makes a great present.It is extremely versatile, and I like it.  Here’s why:+++ The head can swivel all the way around.  This means you can actually use it completely vertically (to pry crown molding, for example, off of the ceiling), or turn it 90 degrees to allow for maximum leverage to pull up regular nails.  You can also swivel the head and stop it in what appears to be around 10 degree increments to allow you to pick your angle for the best leverage or clearance.+++ It is very versatile.  My first thought was –well, here is an excellent nail puller, but then when I played with the swiveling head, and the sharp ends I realized that it could also be used to delicately pry two pieces of wood apart.  This would allow you to take off baseboards or molding, for example, with the very good possibility of doing so without unnecessarily damaging the wood, allowing you to reuse the pieces.  (This makes it very useful to the craftsman who wants to do some renovation work.)++ There is a bit of raised steel where you can strike a hammer.  This allows you to wedge the head in there between two tight pieces of wood and tap away safely with some extra force.  No trying to hit a curved corner (like on a normal pry bar) and risk having the hammer skid down the bar and hitting your fingers.++ The size (18 inches) is small enough to carry around easily, and unlike the much larger pry bars this one is very easy to store and carry through hallways without worrying you’ll drop it or clip a corner or something.+ It is a big, meaty, nail puller and pry bar and it has a good plastic handle to hold on to (instead of a cold metal bar).But, it isn’t perfect.It doesn’t appear to be made with junk steel, but it also isn’t made with the highest quality grade of hardened steel either.  This means that it might not work perfectly on extremely repetitive work like prying out a ton of nails.  (I pulled around 6 really tough nails and spikes out of the mortar on the side of my brick wall house and though it was a success, I can absolutely see how this caused a little bit of wear and tear on the tool, and I bet performance would be really degraded if I pulled out 100 such nails.Overall I like this tool and I would recommend it as a versatile catch-all tool for someone doing normal home renovation.  Or, if you price the cost of replacing this tool after doing major jobs, then I’d also allow that a tradesman might also get some excellent use out of it.  Just don’t expect it to last through repetitive and damaging work over time.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19TK8U2FYNPJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NM6VSC#wasThisHelpful","R19TK8U2FYNPJT","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tried this and I liked it relatively well.  It took some getting used to the tubeless roll, but in the end I think in the name of efficiency and waste prevention it is worth it.So the deal with the tube is this.  It just isn't there.  The paper is instead wrapped around (what I would guess to be) a square rod which is later removed.  This leads to the toilet paper roll being slightly square, which is not really noticeable until you pull it from a dispenser -then the thing jerks slightly at every quarter turn, just like those dispensers in some public restrooms where they are made to be off balance so that the roll doesn't keep rolling if you pull it, and where the paper tears every turn (getting you to use less paper).  Well, the paper doesn't tear inefficiently here –it will keep rolling- but it does take some getting used to the continual pulling that you need to do to get the paper you need.  (On the flip side, however, no 2 year olds are going to be able to easily spin the whole roll off with a few big swipes!)HOWEVER, what I couldn't get past, and why I won't be buying this regularly is that it isn't as soft as the brand that I have found I like best, and I am not willing to give that up.  Probably the main reason for this is that it comes from 40% recycled paper.  Again, another WONDERFUL thing, but recycled paper does not lead to the absolute softest rolls -you need fresh trees for that.  So, if compromising some softness is something that doesn’t bother you, then I would highly recommend it.  Believe me, you can get used to the tubeless roll.  It isn’t that big a deal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSKMPDY7063Y6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQA29FW#wasThisHelpful","RSKMPDY7063Y6","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have yet to be disappointed by the durability of Belkin products.  I've bought cheaper items, but they usually end up disappointing me in one of two ways: 1) The adapter fails and stops charging (or charges really slowly).  This is usually when I buy a too good to be true Chinese knockoff, and it just stops working after a week or two 2) And this is most common, the end of the cable (where it joins to the device) ends up becoming worn very quickly and usually detaches from the items, leaving to exposed wires.  (I've even had this happen on an Amazon basics cable, which surprised me.)Therefore, off of the bat this device has already passed my two ""pain tests"" above.  I have used it regularly, and bent the heck out of the wires, and it has not degraded one bit.  All four ports continue to perform, and I have no complaints.One suggestion, though.  Do yourself a favor and ALSO buy two short cables for charging whatever devices you have, and permanently leave them in the car hooked up to this device.  You will thank yourself for not having to remember to always find a cable in the house or another car and will never be in a situation where you have the charger, but no cables  It is a worthwhile investment, trust me!There was nothing about this product that failed to meet my expectations.

"The neat thing about this kind of product is that it does not require any adhesives.  You literally can pull it off if you don't like it, and can adjust it or move it to another window without too much difficulty.However, there are several things you must do to ensure success; good prep work is an absolute must.  For optimal results you need to do the following: 1) Measure the exact interior dimensions of your window frame.  You should do this it to the millimeter to ensure perfect placement.  This is because you MAY have to trim your window film to fit your window if it is a slightly different size, or if you want to cover only the bottom or top window pane.  (If you need to do this I recommend laying the unstuck window film down on a collapsed cardboard box, and using a razor blade to trim the plastic right on top of the cardboard).  2) You need to do a really good Windex cleaning of the window before placing the film.  Don't skimp on this part.  Clean all the way to the edges, as any dirt or grime under the film will, over time, cause the friction to be less.  3) And finally, definitely use a squeegie to press the air bubbles out of the window film, don't try to do it by hand.  And, if you squeegie is really dirty on the rubber blade (like mine was, from using it on outside windows that got dirty), either clean it really well or buy a new one to ensure proper movement.If you do all of these things you should have a painless setup.  (It is also forgiving, as you can pull up the film and redo it if you need to.)Finally, the appearance of the product is pretty good.  I hadn't tried any stained glass films before, mostly just the blurry privacy ones, but this worked just as well.  Note: the clear parts are really clear, so I personally wouldn't use this as a privacy shield -if you are looking for that I would look specifically for that model.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKCUZPP2JVZSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UALS6QY#wasThisHelpful","RKCUZPP2JVZSB","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this works pretty nicely.  We use it for our 2-3 month old at the dinner table (since we have another young one we are watching as well).  She is active enough that she won't sit still in a non-moving chair, but is soothed or entertained enough on the lowest setting in this one that we can actually eat dinner together!Yes it is rather noisy (with sounds like gears grinding) when the swing starts, but that actually mostly goes away after about 20 seconds.  What you are hearing is the seat's automatic weight detector, and (something like) a transmission slippage until the weight of the seat is heavy enough to activate the lowest gear.  It is kind of like your 5 speed bike as a child -with you pushing down to the fifth speed too early, and your legs really working to get you to where you aren't exerting a lot of effort at that speed.What I really like about this swing is that you are only a simple button push away from changing the seat from swinging from left to right, to front to back, or from back to front.  This is actually easier than you'd think to do, and you can do it in mid-motion without stopping the machine.Also, the seat adjusts to two settings -one is mostly horizontal, and one is mostly vertical.  This is an excellent choice to have as well.Additionally, there is a mobile which can spin around (if you desire) and you can choose between playing forest sounds, or music.We only use the first speed setting for our 2 month old, but our 2 year old (who is still a few months under the weight limit) likes to get in from time to time, and asks us to put it on the fastest setting, which is reasonably fast, but not ""oh my god!"" fast.I was pleasantly surprised by the versatility of this seat, and yes, its construction.  It was a breeze to put together, and I mean that.  I think there are only 4 or five pieces to connect (along with the padding and harness) and you can do so with the tool provided.  Very nice.

"This lives up to my image of Belkin products: it is well constructed and durable.  It is also stylish and reasonably well designed.PROS:+++ HIGH QUALITY CONSTRUCTION.  This isn't going to snap or wear out too quickly.  All the pieces are either thick plastic or (internally) metal.++ EASY INSTALL.  Very simple to use –just pull open the side grippers and plop your phone in.  And if you want to charge your phone, too, you can thread a cord through the hole in the back of the mount stem.++ GOOD VIEWING ANGLE.  I had no problems with the rotation ability and viewing angle of the mount.  I could see my phone screen without issue.+ OK INSTALL OF MOUNT.  Though it works, it does so by a twist-to-lock (circular compression) instead of a push-to-lock (lever compression) method.  I like the lever compression method better, as I think it provides an easier (and more suction-y) install, but I haven’t had the mount fall from the windshield yet, either.NEGATIVES:- TWO HANDS REQUIRED FOR USE.  It takes TWO hands to put your phone in the cradle and to take it out (or else you risk pulling the mount off of the windshield.)  This is NOT something you can install while driving (though you can remove it one-handed.)Overall I am pretty happy with this holder.

"As a regular detergent it is fine.  It cleans clothes adequately, and is not crazily overpriced for a name brand.  However, I came away from this thinking it would somehow be safer for my baby than other “normal” detergents, but I didn’t find that to be the case.  Well, I will say this –this detergent did not cause any rashes on my children, so I have no complaints about it causing any skin irritations, but why on earth are they putting scent in this detergent for babies? Baby smell is about the best thing on earth, and I hate to cover it up with a non-natural perfume.  I would much rather this product had NO scent at all, since Dreft already sells scent boosters which can be added if so desired…The other thing that bothered me is that you can’t find any of the ingredients on the bottle.  I am certain this is done because there is only a negative benefit to the company to do so, and after checking the website and finding the pdf link with the ingredients list, and then Wikipedia-ing the list, I can see why.  Some of the ingredients here are just as unsafe as other chemicals in other detergents.  (I don’t know any more about these ingredients than a regular person, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t bother me a little bit.)  Be that as it may, I have used Dreft in the past but I suppose I was misled into thinking it was somehow better or safer than “all natural versions”, or products from Seventh Generation (for example).SO, if you DON’T want artificial scent on your baby –this is not for you.  If you DON’T want the suspect ingredients (as listed on the Proctor and Gamble website) touching your baby’s skin, then this is not for you.  If you DO want something more natural, organic, or with fewer artificial additives or chemical, then this is also NOT for you.BUT, if those items don’t concern you, or if you if just want a detergent that will be less harsh on your baby’s skin, than say “Tide”, then this is a valid choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I93U4I6KJMF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TB7422U#wasThisHelpful","R3I93U4I6KJMF4","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like these.  I use the ultra-fine black Sharpies all the time to write on glossy white label tape (to mark Tupperware bowls for school), so was interested in seeing how the super bright colors would hold up.  Overall they are nice.  They write really easily and the colors are bold.However, the colors are NOT fluorescent colors like you might find in some other specialty ink pens, so don't buy them if you are hoping to get wowed by inks.  They are, instead, nice and slightly more muted versions of the colored cap covers sealing the pens.  I liked them, but I can see how I'd be a little disappointed if I was REALLY looking for colors that POPPED!Finally, if your hands cramp easily because you are applying too much pressure when writing (like I do), or, if you want a good pen to write on those glossy greeting  cards or wrapping papers (where inks tend to smudge immediately!) then it might be worth giving these a shot.

"Ok, so I am someone who usually sleeps in a sleeping bag outside of the 4 coldest months, so I don’t worry much about insulation.  I also don’t mind hard surfaces and don’t usually use any other mats for support (or insulation) under my bag, or a pillow –usually just rolled up clothes.  (If I do use something for insulation I’ll use a yoga mat.)  I don’t do a lot of hiking, so weight isn’t that much of a concern for me.And with that background, I gave this a try.  But before I did so my thoughts were the following:1) Why on earth is this thing so expensive? Can’t you just buy an inflatable mat at  the price?2) Do you REALLY care that much about weight that you have to cut out of the mat?After using it I’ve mellowed a bit on the product, but for ME (and my type of camping) it isn’t necessary.  BUT, I’ve come to respect the professional quality of the product, and I recognize the value it will provide to more professional (or avid) hikers and campers.PROS:+++ IT SAVES A LOT OF SPACE.  No more rolling up the yoga mat and strapping that on under the sleeping bag –unless you need it for insulation.  (If you just want comfort then this works fine.  If you really want to keep distance between you and the floor, then I might still consider some other ground covering first.)  This item really is about the size of a soda can when rolled up.  If you are interested in SERIOUS hiking, and have to minimize bulk, then this could definitely be for you.+++ VERY EASY TO SET UP.  It took me 3 breaths for the pillow and 6 for the body to get it fully inflated.+++ HIGH QUALITY AIR INTAKE NOZZLES.  I expected the old fashioned plug nozzle, and I was pleasantly surprised at their advanced design and superior craftsmanship.  They were VERY easy to blow into, and very easy to use to deflate.  I see where some of the premium price comes from.  This does not have the typical lower quality parts of an el-cheapo air mattress.+ VERY LIGHT.  This isn’t that big a deal FOR ME since it is so small I expected it to be light, and yoga mats (or whatever) aren’t really heavy, but if every ounce counts, this is a plus.+ COMES WITH A REPAIR KIT.  And the kit is tucked inside the storage bag, so you don’t have to remember to pack it separately.  A nice touch.+ SELF LEVELING PILLOW IS NICE.  Because it is angled towards the center you tend to slide towards the center, instead of sliding off of the pillow.  This is a good design.+ REASONABLY COMFORTABLE.  I am a side sleeper so it wasn’t quite as comfortable as when I was on my back, but I really had no complaints.  I don’t know if this is because I like hard surfaces, or if I was truly supported where I needed to be, but there you go.CONS:- VERY EXPENSIVE.  No, it is not a rip-off, but it is definitely a premium product designed for a serious hiking market.Basically, if you’ve got cash to spend and want high quality goods, or if you camp all the time then this might be for you.  BUT, if you are like me, and are only a “once in a while” camper, you may not find that it is worth the price premium.  Would I personally buy this with the amount of camping I do? No.  Would I consider it for someone else who LOVES to camp? Yes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31P1JOE4EKZIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GK4LUXQ#wasThisHelpful","R31P1JOE4EKZIK","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great value.  It is not going to last forever (like a Kitchen Aid) but it isn't going to need replacement in a couple of years (like a mixer half the price).One thing I really liked about this one was that it came with a lot of attachments.  It comes with both a big bowl and a small bowl.  It also comes with a set of two whisks, two beaters, and two dough mixers.  (You don't have to buy these attachments separately!)It is lighter than a Kitchen Aid (and a lot easier to move around).  You are not going to strain lifting this if you store it somewhere other than on your counter.It is well balanced and offers a tilt function (which locks open) so you can get full access to the bowls, and to eject or insert more attachments.Adding attachments is as easy as you'd expect: push in and click, and they are locked in until you press the eject button to remove them.The motor has twelve speeds and it whirs faster and faster on a continuum as it reaches the higher speeds (or slows down to a lower speed).  Therefore speed increase or decrease is not immediate (like it is with a Kitchen Aid), but perhaps it offers a little finer control (since you have double the speed options).  This means, though, you can't lower the speed extremely rapidly (like shifting a gear) --it is more like you are turning down a fan speed and it slows down gradually.  This is not BAD, just different, and you have to plan for it.  (I did think, however, that the top speed was pretty darn fast!)One really nice function I like is that the base has a switch which allows you to push the bowl over a few inches (while still mixing).  This means you can add ingredients very easily (while the mixer is on).  This is very difficult to do with a Kitchen Aid mixer, and I usually have to stop it and raise the top when pouring in liquids to mix.Overall I really like this mixer and if I wasn't interested in an industrial strength Kitchen Aid I would seriously consider this for the average kitchen.

"I’ve used this lock for a couple of weeks now and overall it is pretty good.  I am not crazy about the “push to open the cover” aspect of the lock, but over time it works reasonably well most of the time.  Yes it is a little “fidgety”.  Sometimes you have to push on the front or the back several times with different angles to open the lock (or the lock reset mechanism), but it has always eventually worked for me.Here’s the main thing.  If you want a lock on YOUR stuff, and YOU are the one opening it, this is a good security choice.  BUT, if you want a lock on YOUR FAMILY’S stuff, unless they all get trained on how to open it they are going to struggle and potentially not be able to easily figure out the lock.  This is because of the fidgety latch, and also because you have to know to squeeze BOTH sides with some pressure before the lock will open.  It doesn’t automatically pop open like other locks.One advantage to this is that it is more secure.  You can’t just bumble your way through this lock, trying all the combinations in the hope that the lock loop will just automatically pop out if you happen upon the right combination.  And, you aren’t going to know you happened onto the right combination until you push in the buttons and the lock opens up.  This is going to make it really frustrating for someone who doesn’t know the lock try to open it up, even with the correct combination.Another thing about this lock.  It is very easy to set.  You don’t need a pin inserted (like some other locks) to change the combination.  This makes it a breeze to change it on the fly, but this may not be something you want.  For example, I will likely NEVER change the combination on the lock to my shed.  My family all knows it, and I don’t have too many valuable items in there, just items that are dangerous to young ones.  So, if someone got the idea that it would be funny to change dad’s combination, they could do it in a flash –making things very difficult for me.  (In this case I prefer the other style of lock, like the “Sesamee K436 4 Dial Bottom Resettable Combination Brass Padlock “, where without the lock setting pin no one is going to reset the lock.)One more important note.  This is a DOUBLE lock.  It won’t be noticeable in normal use (except for having to squeeze both sides to open), but if you (theoretically) cut through one side of the boron shackle it won’t allow you to take the lock off unless you also cut through the other side to cut a large enough gap in the shackle.  This is absolutely more secure than a standard lock, and would take twice as long to cut through, if that were even an option.Finally, the combination dial isn’t on the bottom like traditional locks (or the Sesame lock mentioned above, which I also have –and love).  It is recessed on the side and you have to open a panel to see it.  I am not a fan of this design, but I suppose it keeps the dials less exposed to the elements and would be a plus in a marine or wet/freezing environment.Overall this is a good lock.  It is very easy to reset, and very hard to open –either by brute force, or by guessing the dial combination.  It is also very resistant to the elements, and something I’d feel safe using in a situation where a keyed lock wasn’t desirable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7KY084DKS0M2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NV6X67O#wasThisHelpful","R7KY084DKS0M2","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought these curtains were fine.  Though not initially impressed with the fact that they were polyester, they do have the advantage of being less likely to stain when used in high traffic areas, and touched by fingers all the time.I found the edges of all the curtains to be un-frayed and had no qualms with their construction.My only complaint is that they were not as fine as I would have liked.  I thought they would filter out more light, but the only filtering was on the thicker pattern, while the areas WITHOUT the pattern were almost see through -not a good idea if you (like I) happen to be using this on a stairwell window where the idea is to let as much light in as possible while providing as much privacy as possible (since there were no other curtains).  As a result I found them much less useful for my needs.  However, if you don't require as much light filtering you'll probably be fine with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB5NCMZ1LH1QB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXYDN84#wasThisHelpful","RB5NCMZ1LH1QB","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So the main thing about the tape measure is that it works fine without any major defects.  It has a belt clip for ease of carry, it has good readability on the tape (and it is a matte finish so it won’t reflect much outside), and it has very precise measurements for the first half a foot.  (Not sure why they didn’t carry that all the way through, though…)It is a rather odd size, however, and because of this I don’t see a way to measure something like a floor to ceiling without bending the tape 90 degrees (at the floor or the ceiling) at one end to read it.  I mean, how wide is the thing, EXACTLY? My other tape measure is exactly 2.5 inches long so I know to add this to anything I measure if I put it on the floor and pull the tape measure up. (MINUS 1 star.)The other thing, and this is relatively minor, is that it stands very precariously when you tilt it vertically and let go.  It WILL stand up, but only barely, and any gentle touch will knock it over.  The design could have easily been made ‘less cool’ and the product made much more stable.  As a result I would not take this anywhere on a ladder (or on any tall object or shelf) unless I placed it sideways all the time, because it WILL fall and hit someone or break something.  (MINUS 1 star –I knocked it over already and it bounced down the stairs).On the other hand, it does have a fantastic feature which sells the product: it has an auto-lock mechanism.  This means when you open it up it stops automatically where you opened it without you having to adjust a tension knob to prevent it from retracting.  This is a superb feature and I will look for it in future tape measures. (PLUS 1 star –this is a wonderful addition.)Overall I really like this tape measure.  Though, I would not recommend it if you do a lot of professional measuring (like making cabinets or something like that) due to the inability to judge the size of the casing of the irregularly sized tape housing, and the slight instability of the device.  (Even if you place it on its side, since the casing is slimmer on the edges and slightly fatter in the center, it will wobble, flat.) NOW I understand why professional tape measures are a little boring -fully flat on one size, and about the same thickness in all parts of the device, with a very stable housing, and easy to measure (with the housing included in the measurement).Those caveats aside, if you are an amateur, like me, and don’t do much carpentry it works wonderfully and I recommend it.  I would absolutely get this as a present for the casual user.  They will love it… (…as much as one can love a tape measure).","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V7UHXYGNILFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KX4KFX0#wasThisHelpful","R3V7UHXYGNILFD","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These aren't the best scissors I've used, but that is fine -these are medium level craft scissors.  You can cut paper as easily as you can cut fabric, and I like not having to find different scissors for different tasks.I also really like the wide base grip which allows you to get your whole hand in there for leverage, and to reduce strain on your hands if you are doing a lot of cutting.The blades are pretty sharp and they look like they'll keep their edge longer than you'll need the scissors.  They are a good value, too; you don't have to think too hard if they are a good investment or not.  They are good scissors, and I would have no regrets purchasing these.I haven't felt the need to adjust the cutting tension but the ability is there with the special screw holding the blades together.  I suppose if I were doing a lot of crafting this would be a huge plus -as there's nothing worse than repetitive ANYTHING if it isn't comfortable.The only thing I would change is that I would make the handle a little softer, but I understand that THAT is really something that you find on more expensive scissors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLZ3EHI9OGGLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSUN9JK#wasThisHelpful","RLZ3EHI9OGGLF","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This food seems to be working a little too hard on a fairy-tale food image.  There is a picture of a child mixing a batch of “something”, and then the advertising says “we take the time to mix every batch”.  It seems kind of funny that I’d associate some sort of industrial cat food mixer with a child or a chef mixing a delicate soufflé or a chocolate ganache with a wooden spoon –like the act of mixing somehow is (their words) “unique”, and that it somehow (their words) “provide(s) your cat… with uncompromised nutrition.”  That seems a rather strange cause and effect, and really seems to me that their advertising department was really stretching for something to say, while not really saying too much.  I mean, OF COURSE you mix each batch.  You don’t just slop the ingredients in there separately –the cats wouldn’t go for it.That ridiculous advertising intro aside, I think all that matters with cat food is three things: 1) Price 2) Quality and 3) Do your cats eat it.1) The price is reasonable given the other similar alternatives on the market.  No complaints there.2) The quality appears to be high.  There’s not too much that the company says about the ingredients other than they are “sourced” and “authentic”.  (This is what you can say when you can’t say organic.  I mean, I sourced my ham sandwich for lunch today –right from the bag in the fridge.  AND, I made sure to source authentic HAM, and not a cheap knockoff made from something non-ham-ish.)  I will say this, though, I liked that when reading the ingredient list I was able to identify a bunch of them: apples, egg whites, green peas, potatoes, fish oil, carrots, chicken, pork liver, and so on… it wasn’t just cheap filler or unknown mixtures.3) Yes, it appears to taste good.  The cats eat it.  And, they lick up the gravy –so I call that a win.Silly advertising aside, I didn’t find anything in this cat food that disappointed me.  When trying wet cat food I’d likely start cheaper, but if I were trying to find a higher quality brand for a finicky cat I’d give this a shot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VSC7F5WE0KIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI32G9S#wasThisHelpful","R3VSC7F5WE0KIQ","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(There's not much swelling to worry about, but the coolness helps ""fix"" the problem.)What I like about this one is that I can chill the ice pack separately from the covering.  (We have other brands that have no covering, but we struggle with keeping them out of our little one's mouth, for fear that the gel pack could get punctured and leak over time.)  This lion cool pack, however, since it is furry on the outside, is not appealing to my toddler to place in his mouth, and really is only used for the purpose we intended, which is to place directly on the skin, or the head.It is a little harder than I thought to insert the ice pack, so is not something my toddler could do on his own -an adult really does have to get it ready.  That aside, for the price it really is a reasonable solution.  (The fact that it is an animal also makes it something that my toddler can visualize and easily associate with his ""boo-boos"".

"I have a garden and last year the rabbits just destroyed a couple of plants all summer long.  This year, again, the rabbits destroyed a plant and ate all the leaves. However, I received this product and decided to put it down around the plant anyway to test it.  A few weeks later I was pleasantly surprised to see that the plant had regrown perfectly, and didn't have any damage to any of the leaves.  This was a shock because I realized that I don't think I'd ever seen the plant with leaves like that.  Usually they were nibbled away as fast as they could grow.The product is composed of pellets, and I find this a more durable delivery system than a powder (that stunk to high heaven) I used a few years back.  The pellets are easier to spread, and you don't have to worry about the pellets blowing into the plants while you are placing them down.On the other side, they are NOT odorless.  They do stink, but they are not noticeable (to me) a few feet away, which is how I want it.  The powder I used before tended to get more airborne, and really reeked.

"This organizer has two straps to connect to the back of the car seat -one on top (which goes around your headrest), -and one on the bottom (which goes around the base of your seat).  Both of the straps are adjustable, and both of them can be made to mostly disappear by tucking them under the headrest, and in the section of the seat which joins the top and the bottom.  You won't really see the straps, or feel them when sitting in the seat in front, which is great.I found the installation and adjustment pretty easy, though I thought the top strap wasn't perfect.  It was a really awkward angle for me to apply the last bit of pressure to keep the top of the seat really tight, and I gave up when it was ""good enough"", instead.  It works fine, but I imagine I'll have to give it another go when it sags a bit over time.As for the pockets, there are several sizes and styles and I found those to be mostly useful.  The drink pockets aren't big, but they are big enough -you'll find containers that will work, even if the pockets don't fit larger ones.  (What I think is a complete waste, though, is that clear plastic pocket on the back.  The suggestion from the company is that this is where you should put a phone -that is about the dumbest idea I've heard, especially since it is a tight fit, and you are prevented from hearing sounds by the plastic, and from touching the screen effectively.  You should have changed the pocket slightly and perhaps marketed it as a place to store those small pocket tissue packs or something...)The design is cute, and my little one is yelling ""Mon-keeeeeey!"" when he sees it, so that is nice.Finally, what I like best about the organizer is that there are mesh pockets.  This allows me to put my little one's toys in there (like matchbox cars) and still allow me to see where things are stored without having to go digging for it.For the price this is a decent deal, and it does the job without any major flaws.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OJ41Z8O5O8XK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SK4V8YU#wasThisHelpful","R2OJ41Z8O5O8XK","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These lights impressed me by their extremely solid construction.  They are made from metal and glass -a nice change from the cheaper plastic versions I've used in the past.  They also have on/off switches (which aren’t really necessary) but which allow you to wait a full day/night cycle before turning them on to ensure they are fully charged the first full night of use.What I really liked about them was chiefly their rugged build quality, but also the fact that their light continued shining bright, all night long.  I’ve used other versions which really are only bright for a few hours, but these seemed to make it the whole way through.Keep in mind, though, that these are really PATH lights –they don’t shine light UP at your house, as the light is directed downward, in about a one foot radius around the light.  This makes the light PERFECT for lighting up a pathway that you always want seen, or for placing in flower gardens to bring a pleasing color contrast into the night, and giving you a little more visibility/safety around your house.They weren’t perfect, though.  I did have a flake of paint which came off on the stake of one of the lights, and though mine was pretty minor, and not viewable from the angle it was staked at, I gather it is a bigger problem for other users.The other item of note is that I had a tough time twisting on one of the stakes.  One of them went on fine, but the other one required me applying a significant amount of pressure, and then unscrewing the pole, and re-screwing a different part of the pole into a different part of the pole –which helped to fix my problem.  I didn’t have to go to my final step (which was to apply oil or WD-40 to the jamming threads) but I almost had to go there.So, in conclusion, I really like how hearty these path lights are, and I really like the quality and the duration of light they produce.  I thought I little more attention, however, could have been given to quality control in shipping, and I thought the installation experience was harder than expected, and could be very difficult for those with less strength in their hands.  (Use WD-40 to lubricate the threads if this is the case!)EDIT: around a month after I wrote this review one of the two lights has completely died and will no longer function.

Huggies and Pampers have at least 5 brands and it gets old really quickly trying to compare and contrast them, along with generic brands and other lesser brands.In our household, we use a combination of Pampers and Huggies, depending on what’s available, and the age of the child.  (We favor the Huggies Overnites for night time sleeping from a size 3 upwards, and mostly Pampers, otherwise…)So, when I got these to try I was really struggling trying to tell the difference between the Huggies Little Snugglers, the Overnites, and a couple of other Pampers brands.After comparing them I really see only a couple of minor differences, but they might be appealing enough to warrant a purchase for testing with your child.First, there is no “pee strip”.  For a really young one I find this essential, so I would choose the Pampers or Huggies versions which both include those instead.  For an older child it becomes less important once the volume of liquid increases, and you’ll smell it before you see the indicator.Second, (and the key for this diapers), there is a nice stretchy waistband on the back which seems to work pretty well.  I’d say that if you are struggling with blowouts that leak out the top back of the diaper then I would definitely purchase these diapers to see if the more secure fit in back makes a difference –because it should.And third, they seem to be a more “value” brand when compared to the other versions, which should save some money.  They are not marketed as Huggies’ “best” diaper, but if you feel you don’t need the “pee strip” then I see no reason why you shouldn’t give these a shot –especially if you can get a good price on them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25ORUHV2WRNIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TX1KI7C#wasThisHelpful","R25ORUHV2WRNIY","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this would be somewhat underwhelming and I am happy to say I was wrong.  It really had everything in it that I would have bought myself if I were starting from scratch, and didn't have any of those useless items that companies try to sell new parents who don't have the experience to know whether or not it would be useful.To begin with, in a wise move the box contains three sets of diapers -1 set of newborns and 2 sets of size one.  I say wise because if this is a gift for someone you really don't know how long their infant will be in newborns.  If it is a big baby, not long at all! This allows you to cover all bases, and gives the mother a size up for when the newborn size just doesn't cut it anymore.It also provides you a travel size of baby wipes.  That is nice, but what makes it a real winner is that the case is refillable AND the box comes with a HUGE amount of refills that you can seal with a Ziploc type seal, only taking what you need to refill the travel case.Finally, there are three other features that this package has which makes me really happy with this box:1) The wipes are unscented.  With children's allergies on the rise, and with no knowledge yet of what causes them I try to stick to a less is better mentality when it comes to scents or artificial anything that goes on or in the body.  As such, I always look for unscented wipes, and these fit the bill.  (I was surprised; I thought a gift box would definitely come with scented wipes.)2) The newborn diapers have a cutout for the umbilical cord.  Though only a big deal for a week or so, it was nice that these diapers --unlike another brand I was also using- came with a cutout that prevented abrasion against the umbilical cord.  This was a thoughtful addition, and made it easier to put on the diaper for the first week of life.3) It has a ""pee strip"".  This is something I'd only previously seen in another brand, and is a must have in my household, so I was pleasantly surprised that these Huggies diapers now included it.Highly recommended as a gift for someone else (or yourself) starting out with a newborn.  It is so useful that if a family got one from someone else as well you'd still be able to use everything in both boxes.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QQHMTXHMAQFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQA23R6#wasThisHelpful","R2QQHMTXHMAQFV","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We wash our bottles every night in hot soapy water.  However, there are times when this is not feasible –like in a pump room without adequate washing facilities, or while traveling.  In such cases where only a brisk cold water rinse may be possible, and with the availability of a microwave, this product comes to the rescue.It is very simple to use, portable, and sterilizes what you’ve put in the bag in a relatively short time.Another thing I like is that the bag allows you to mark right on it that you’ve used a cycle, so that you can discard it after 20 cycles, when (presumably) the bag starts degrading and potentially leeching plastic byproducts in future cycles.The only downside that I found was that the bag is small and can’t easily fit more than a few items –but if used in travel situations then I’d rate it 5 stars.  (If you plan to use it mostly for home use be sure to buy a bigger bag so you can fit more in it!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFQ6LEXB6FKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GULB27I#wasThisHelpful","R2YFQ6LEXB6FKT","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a HUGE fan of Five Crowns and of SET.  Those games are really original and entertaining.  This one, however, was not as thought provoking as those were.  Don't get me wrong, it is still fun, but it isn't too different from other games you might have played before -like UNO.  Sure it has some variations -it has more ""special"" cards, and some rule twists, but it is along the same lines.  If you hate UNO you probably won't like this game, and if you like it, you probably will.That said, I thought it was fun.  I did have one gripe, however... the cards are really small -smaller than a normal deck of cards.  It is obvious that the makers intend for you to purchase another set so that you can play it with more people, because the insert in the box has two holes, and the entire deck only fills one of the two cavities.  I don't have a problem with the smaller size, per se, but I do have a problem with a huge box which actually takes two decks to fill up.  I much rather would have had a box that was slightly larger than the card deck so that I could put it in my pocket.  Instead, I am stuck with a large rectangular box that reminds me of opening a bag of chips only to find out that two thirds of the bag was air...Okay, enough nitpicking -still a fun game, though better, I think, with three players (rather than two).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCXXVB0UWGVNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZ7FH1M#wasThisHelpful","RCXXVB0UWGVNE","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like these bags.  I've been burned when I've purchased bags OTHER than Ziploc or Hefty, and there is a reason for it.  I really do believe the quality of these bags is slightly superior to generic store brands.  It only takes a few tears or failures with thinner bags, or ones with weak zippers to make you swear off the low end bags forever.First off, these bags are NOT freezer bags... if you want freezer bags you'll have to purchase something else.  Will they work? Sure, but the freezer bags are more durable and are more likely to keep food fresh that these are.What I liked about these bags.  They have a zipper -not a necessity for me, but a ""nicety"".  Sometimes you don't want to deal with trying to make a seal -especially with the cheaper store bags which may not even have a ""yellow and blue make green"" locking guide.  These however, are pretty foolproof.  The zipper is easy to use, and the slight bumps in the zipper cause a slight zipping noise.  It also claims that you know it is done when it ""clicks"" at the end.  This is a slight exaggeration.  Yes, there is the TINIEST click at the end,  but you have to listen very carefully and even then you may not be sure that you heard it.One slightly obvious but appreciated feature is that the bags have ""open"" and ""closed"" with errors pointing to the correct side.  This is a nice touch because sometimes you can't immediately tell if you've zipped the bag open or shut.The bag also has a white area (like most bags) in which you can write with permanent marker, and easily read it.Finally, and most importantly, for a zipper bag, this provides a good seal.  I filled the bag with water and hung it upside down for an hour and I saw no leakage.  At best I thought I might see a slight drip, reinforcing my presupposition that these bags are best for non liquids, but they really seemed to do the job well.  I've used them for a week now and have no complaints, with the slight exception that if I were trying to be frugal I'd avoid these and get the non-zippered bags, instead.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KGHSSDEP1UAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E0FZQ0#wasThisHelpful","R1KGHSSDEP1UAE","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although not a brand I'd personally tried before, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this Curel product.  I like to use lotion on my face after a shower and I have sometimes been disappointed by ""fragrance free"" lotion products before.  Once I tried something that claimed to be fragrance free, or something like that, but not quite that exact language.  I was then disappointed by the scent -yes, it still had an odor, even though nothing artificial had been added.  And, since it was used on my face, it was very obvious and I had to smell it until it was completely absorbed.I am happy to say, though, that with this product there was no scent at all.  Very nice.What else can I say? Well, it claimed to be non-greasy, and after using it for a couple of weeks I have to agree.  I've had no clogged pores, or reaction, or anything that I didn't like.It also seems to absorb quickly.  Ever tried a lotion that you need to wait a few minutes before touching skin that you've used it on? This is not it.  After rubbing it in you don't have to wait long before the opportunity to rub it off goes away while it is completely absorbed.  I have a more ""specialty"" lotion which takes forever to absorb, and I don't like it as much as this for that very reason.There was nothing about this product I did not like.  It worked well, the dispenser did its job nicely, it wasn't greasy, and there was no odor.  I can't think of anything else I'd need to look for, in a product at this price point.

"When I first tried this monitor I was shocked to see all the bad reviews.  I had used it for a couple of days and had no issues -in fact, I pretty much liked it! Then I realized that in my haste to get cracking on this thing I didn't bother using the WIFI feature, I just got it going out of the box, and used it with only the included hardware... and when I did that, I had no issues.But when I got down to it and followed the instructions to use the monitor with my phone I was sorely disappointed.  IT... DID... NOT... WORK... For those of you who have struggled with setting up routers or yelled at your computer or phone when you are trying to configure something that is just out of your knowledge zone, then you'll understand my frustration.  I am a tech savvy guy, and I followed all the instructions to a T -and everything seemed to go to plan, until it didn't.Here's how it went down: download app (check!), register on app with name, email and password (annoying, but check!), scan QR code on back of monitor (very nice! advanced tech at work here...), now within the app find your home network (check!), and now type your home network password (ugh, I have to dig that up again? fine...), now go into your phone settings and pick the monitor's ""Summer WIFI"" network (ugh, I have to change my phone WIFI to the monitor WIFI? does this mean I have to change it every time I don't want to look at the monitor and browse the web using my home network? what a hassle, but ok), ooh look, it says it is connected! now go back to the app and it fully loads and says... uh oh, not connected. What??? then I spent 15 minutes going back into my phone settings, troubleshooting, and trying to find the issue.  The ""Summer WIFI"" network kept appearing and disappearing, and then it was gone for good.  It didn't appear again, so I pulled the plug and deleted the app. Too much hassle.  Thank goodness I don't need the WIFI function, or I'd be returning the product.So I say to you -DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT THE WIFI UNLESS YOU READ A BUNCH OF REVIEWS AND SEE WHAT PEOPLE SAY THE ISSUES ARE, AND ARE STILL COMFORTABLE GIVING IT A SHOT.  I would NOT buy it if you want the WIFI function, unless you are ok with returning it.Will it work for you? who knows? what phone do you have? (I have an iPhone 6)... what internet do you have? (I have FIOS)... was my problem related to either of those? was it because of a defective monitor? was it just a blip in the WIFI? who knows... Too much hassle for me, and since I don't need the WIFI it wasn't worth the stress of taking time away from my children to deal with it.BUT, and this is a big BUT. If you really don't care about the WIFI, or if a newer model of the camera seems to fix the WIFI issue and people love it again, OR if you got it as a gift, THEN and only then I like the camera a lot.Unlike the two other similarly priced cameras I have, this one allows you to move the camera around with the handheld remote/monitor.  This is a VERY nice feature.It also has a belt clip, which my other cameras lacked, and makes it easy to walk around with in the house if you have your hands full.It also has an in room temperature sensor (which only one of my other cameras has, and which I like).  My house is old and has hot and cold areas so it was useful information to have.It also is very easy to understand -the buttons have words on them, and the plugs have pictures on them! (this was AWESOME; you can't get the wall plugs confused because one has a drawing of the camera on it, and one has a drawing of the monitor on it).There is a battery indicator on it, which is helpful.  It also beeps when the battery gets low (so you don't sleep through the night and have your monitor turn off because the battery runs out and you didn't realize it wasn't plugged in).You also have a switch on the camera which allows you to turn off the green light ring on the camera, to make it less visible at night -this is a nice touch, as it won't be visible to your child.I thought the picture quality was good, too.  (Keep in mind, though, that I am basing this off of the camera hardware, and no WIFI connection.  I bet a lot of complaints have to do with poor streaming quality, which you avoid if you are avoiding the WIFI mode.)And finally, the two way intercom feature has a nicer and less robotic sound than my other monitors.All in all, if this monitor/camera package were not WIFI enabled (and the price were a little lower, to be comparable to non-WIFI enabled monitors) I would actually consider giving this item 5 stars, but because the main selling point of this monitor is the WIFI, and because my WIFI mode success rate over the course of one hour of setup and troubleshooting was 0%, my opinion of this product declines significantly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G3N6623TGXJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5QTESS#wasThisHelpful","R1G3N6623TGXJY","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I previously purchased a much cheaper “Scotch Thermal Laminator 2 Roller System (TL901)” a few years ago, and have been using it off and on.  It laminates up to 9 inches wide, and pouches of up to 5 ml thick.  I never had any problems with it, but sometimes would have to laminate objects twice to make sure that it was done right.  So is getting Fellowes Saturn3i Laminator at FOUR times the cost worth it? It depends.  Do you want an entry level car? Or do you want a luxury sedan? Both can be right for you, for different reasons.PROS:+++ REALLY QUICK TO START.  The Saturn3i only took 50 seconds to warm up.  I was impressed.  My other laminator took up to five minutes to heat up and only had a red light indicator come on when ready.  THIS one, however, beeps as soon as it is ready to go.  Nice.+++ VERY SIMPLE TO USE.  There is a wire guide on the back to keep the laminated object straight, and there is a simple to use lever to remove any stuck items.  You cannot miss understanding what thickness you want to laminate with the four simple buttons on the front –each with a size indicated, or cold lamination.  (On the other hand, my cheaper laminator had the same items –a wire guide, a lever to remove stuck sheets, and a toggle switch for each lamination width.)+++ THIS WILL LAMINATE LARGE OBJECTS UP TO 12.5 INCHES WIDE.  This is a key differentiator over other laminators I have seen.  If you really want to laminate large objects, then this is the product to get.  If you don’t have any particular plan to laminate large objects DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION OF THE LAMINATOR… IT IS HUGE.  Buy the smaller version of the same brand of laminator instead.  (I have to say, though, unlike with my smaller laminator, I am actually thinking about additional things to laminate… Looking through some ideas I see I could almost make mini posters, or custom placemats for my kids… it really does open up some possibilities.)+ WILL LAMINATE MULTIPLE THICKNESSES.  This laminator will do 3ml, 4 ml, or 5ml sheets.  (My cheaper laminator would only do 3ml or 5ml sheets.  Is this a big deal? No.  I have no problem choosing either 3 or 5 ml, but the fact that there is more choice is not a bad thing.)NEUTRAL:(o) THIS LAMINATOR IS VERY LONG.  It is bigger than I thought but since the whole purpose of this beast is to laminate larger than normal paper size, this is neither a positive or a negative.  Just be aware.CONS:-- VERY EXPENSIVE.  This is not an inherent criticism of the product; you pay for quality, and my damaged product* aside, this product appears to be “quality”.  My point, though, is that although this is clearly a quality product, you can buy a laminator that does many of the same things, albeit more slowly, at  the price.*Note: When I took my laminator out of the package I noticed that there was a small object loose inside the main body of the mechanism which rattles around whenever I turned it around or flipped it upside down.  (As there is no way to easily open the item I have to ignore it.)  It doesn’t APPEAR to have affected performance or safety, but it worries me that this occurred… I imagine the company wouldn’t have spent money on this internal part if it weren’t necessary.Final thoughts.  If I were to have to purchase a laminator for my personal use, I probably would not purchase this.  I would purchase the much cheaper model.  However, if I truly thought I’d laminate a few objects a month (instead of a few objects a year), or if I were a home crafter and really wanted to use this seriously or professionally, I ABSOLUTELY would purchase this laminator.  It does lamination very quickly and easily, and it accepts VERY large objects for lamination.

"I don’t currently suffer from either, but I can absolutely see where this would be a godsend in those cases.  The amount of pressure you need to apply is way less with these shears (when cutting thick branches) than that is needed for the more traditional Fiskars shears.  However, the hand motion required is slightly awkward, it is for right handed users only, and it is more difficult to use for tiny hands (since the shears open wider than usual due to the gear mechanism operation).PROS:+++ BLADE IS SUPERB.  It is thick, rust resistant, and coated with a slick low friction coating.  There is not much to improve on here.  Based on this alone I would consider any of their bladed products.+++ REQUIRES VERY LITTLE PRESSURE TO USE.  Though you have to squeeze through a larger range of motion, the rolling gear mechanism allows you to get great mechanical advantage –especially when cutting through larger branches.+++ HAS A LIFETIME WARRANTY.  This is critical when you beat the heck out of the shears outside and get it exposed to the elements, oils, and grit.  I like knowing that if I use it REALISTICALLY (and not in some sterile test environment where the tool is cleaned perfectly after use) that it will last.++ EXCELLENT CONSTRUCTION.  It feels very solid.  It is lighter than older models because there is more plastic, but I didn’t find that this degraded the overall quality of the item.++ EASY TO USE SAFETY LOCK.  Unlock some more hard to reach tiny metal blade locks on the sides of older shears, this lock is on top, easy to see, and easy to use.  You can open and shut it with your thumb instead of your index finger, and it will ensure you don’t cut yourself while in transit.CONS:-- THE CUTTING PROCESS IS A LITTLE AWKWARD. The bottom of the blade handle basically spins and rolls towards the top of the handle when you close it.  This makes it a slightly awkward motion to close the blade.  I didn’t like it, but I imagine if I had arthritis I would LOVE it, because the unusual motion would be eminently preferable over hand or joint pain.-- MIGHT BE DIFFICULT FOR SMALL HANDS.  If you have very small hands you might find the range of motion to be a little larger than you are used to.  If this is the case I recommend trying this out in a gardening supply shop before purchasing.- CAN ONLY BE USED RIGHT HANDED.  Though not a problem for a righty like me, I thought it should be pointed out.  The way the gears work it is awkward to use in your left hand.Overall this is a well-crafted instrument.  Though I wasn’t crazy about the gear mechanism making opening and closing the blade awkward (for me), I respect that for certain users of this tool, the benefit will far outweigh the awkwardness.  Without hand or joint pain, however, I’d recommend considering the more traditional shears, while topping them off with the Fiskars 32-Inch PowerGear Bypass Lopper which I recommend highly for the larger jobs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M2D263KZHRJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMWA5AA#wasThisHelpful","R2M2D263KZHRJ7","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I currently use a waiter style corkscrew to open my wines, though I have used many different styles in the past (air pressure injectors, a battery powered corkscrew, the traditional metal screw with two arms that are manually lifted, etc...)  Overall this one performs superbly, but is overly bulky, and has pieces to lose.PROS:+++ VERY EASY TO USE.  I find that this corkscrew is intuitive and requires very little pressure to open.  I was impressed at the ease of use, and would recommend this feature of the corkscrew highly.++ QUALITY MATERIALS & NICE FIT AND FINISH.  The product appendages feel clean and smooth, and pleasant to hold.  (Very much like the ""OXO"" branded products.)NEUTRAL:It comes with a large plastic case, a replacement corkscrew (why? is it so flimsy that it will break? It doesn't look any different from the corkscrew already installed...) and a foil cutter. (I wish they could have just built that in… Who uses this? It is so tiny if not in the case it will just get pushed to the back of the drawer.  I’ll probably just use the tip of a knife instead.)CONS:-- IT IS TOO BULKY FOR ME.  I only have dedicated horizontal drawer space and this contraption really needs to take valuable space vertically because you need to keep the case to hold the corkscrew and the extra pieces which would otherwise soon get lost.  (You really can't just keep the spare corkscrew loose in a drawer -you'll poke yourself or puncture things...)  Unlike some other levered corkscrews this cannot be compressed any tighter than you see in the product picture.  It really is wide, and it makes it awkward to store unless you use the plastic case -which is not appealing for me.  Realistically I would put it sideways in a drawer and just toss out the case, the spare corkscrew, and the foil cutter.- THE CORKSCREW POPPED OFF ONCE DURING USE.  The first time I used it and then ejected the cork the corkscrew apparently was loose and popped off the top and fell on the floor.  It wasn’t broken but I had to put it back on, and rescrew on the bolt.  This was easy to do, but I don’t know why it occurred, and it did not happen the next few times I used the contraption, so I’ll put it down to “first use blues” from the factory.  (This probably wouldn’t have happened if they didn’t design the corkscrew to be replaced.  In fact, I would rather that they would have made it permanent.  If the corkscrew snaps you are probably just going to buy a whole new product, I know I would!)Overall, if you are not at all concerned about the storage of this product, and want something that is easy to use, or if you hate other corkscrews due to the hand pressure you have to use then this is a wonderful product.  I would highly recommend it to people who have limited hand strength or who don’t like fighting a cork in a really tight cork fit.  For me, though, I’ll probably stick to the waiter style one I currently use.  (For my wife, I’ll probably keep this in a bottom cupboard somewhere, if she finds the other corkscrew too difficult to use.  But why is she drinking wine without me? Where am I????)","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JEZP7X3AGYRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQI3Q1I#wasThisHelpful","R1JEZP7X3AGYRB","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was impressed by the case/keyboard.  It converts the iPad Air 2 into a laptop-""lite"" device pretty seamlessly.  I say ""lite"" because it really still isn't a laptop.  Without a mouse or a touchpad it really is only a ‘jacked up iPad’ that is very convenient on the road.  This is not a complaint, because there are laptops that act like, well, laptops, but I didn't want a laptop, only an iPad, with the occasional ability to help with some serious typing when I am traveling.  That said, this really fits the bill well.  The case is slim, it is light, it is sturdy and well designed, and it does what I needed it to do -let me type more easily.The biggest drawback to me with this product was mostly psychological.  It makes the iPad 2 Air more like the original iPad, because it increases the size of the iPad.  (Kind of like when you first got your super slim iPhone but then had to put a case on it after dropping it and cracking the glass… Your iPhone was now protected, but not as slim as it used to be.) Not a criticism, but realize that you are reducing the convenience of size (super slim design), and trading it with a convenience of use (ease of typing).Anyway, on to functionality… The keys on the keyboard have a nice feel to them -they don't feel rickety or cheap.  Yes it isn't a FULL keyboard, as the function keys are doubled (instead of having dedicated keys) but I don't see how they could have optimized the keys much better given the space footprint available.It also has strong magnets embedded in the case which allow you to change the display view of your screen, though none are really drastically different from the other.  (Still, it's better than no choice at all!)Additionally, I found that there is no way to swivel the iPad in the case to obtain portrait mode -which, from a typing perspective, makes sense, though I was a little disappointed.  But, this isn't really meant to be a stand, but a typing facilitator, and the wide iPad screen (since it is so small horizontally, when in portrait mode) really isn't optimized to work that way.  (So, if this really matters to you, consider other cases with this flexibility.)One thing I really liked, though, was the ease of being able to flip the keyboard under the iPad, if you didn't want to disconnect it, but wanted to use it without the keyboard temporarily.Finally, the keyboard comes with a micro-USB for charging, and claims to hold a charge for 6 months.  As the keys are not backlit there (apparently) is very little power consumption, and this keyboard is very energy frugal.  I like how it is an auto-turn on/off keyboard; no struggling to find the power switch or to connect/disconnect the WiFi connection.  Nice touch! Oh, one more thing, apparently Belkin actually sells a more premium version of this keyboard [called ""PRO""] with BACKLIT KEYS and a few other differentiators, so consider that one as well, if the lack of backlighting matters to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZLHMC95B3WPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTDTNLE#wasThisHelpful","RZLHMC95B3WPQ","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very â€œcheapâ€ piece of furniture, but is rather expensive for the quality of the product you receive.  DEFINITELY not heirloom quality, and something Iâ€™d probably just give away or toss in the trash if I were moving, and my kids were a little older, because I am sure it will get scratched, and banged up, and it will not wear well.  (Now, if this were made of plywood, it would easily be double the cost, but worth itâ€¦)It is engineered wood, which means it is terribly heavy, and made of ground up scrap wood which is glued together.  The glue used to bind the wood shards typically also has the potential to â€œoff gasâ€ fumes, but I donâ€™t know enough about the materials and process to speak authoritatively on that.  (Google â€œoffgassingâ€ for more information.)Yes, you can buy a nicer product from Ikea (though youâ€™d have to pay an additional $75 to get it delivered, but it might actually be real wood.)  What you are buying here, though, is something that (if not damaged during shipping or assembly) looks nicer that it is.  (And since it is so heavy Iâ€™d bet that $50 of the cost of the item was probably tied up in the shipping costs.  That makes more sense to me why this would top $200.)Aside from the fact that the â€œwoodâ€ is the cheapest possible wood, two other things reduce the effectiveness of the product in my eyes.  1) the backing is really thin hard cardboard.  I mean, I know that the backing is supposed to be pressed board or something like that, but this may be the thinnest backing I have seen.  2) The instructions, though visual, are pretty sloppy.  Yes there are pictures (and this is a great help) but it is clear there wasnâ€™t someone from the â€œApple Design Teamâ€ working on making these user friendly.  Label the parts more clearly.  Make the labels more easy to peel off.  Label all the parts like Ikea doesâ€¦One note: when making this product solo I recommend the following: take a few pieces out of box to reduce the weight if you are moving it around the house before installation.  Otherwise you risk banging it against the floor or walls, and raise the risk of crushing edges or scratching pieces.  (This engineered wood is pretty fragile, and has a low tensile strength.)  Then, treat each piece like it is made of glass -very delicately! If possible, place them individually on a carpet so they donâ€™t scratch other pieces with their sharp edges, or get scratched by anything on the floor.Overall I would be very leery of ordering this heavy item for delivery, because if it is dropped on the corner pieces WILL crush.  I canâ€™t recommend this product for that primary reason, but Iâ€™ll say that if yours arrives undamaged --not always a given due to the weight, and the fragility of the materials- and if you patiently are able to put it together in the room of final destination, then it may be of use to you.  If you are able to do this, then I give the furniture a 3 star rating (for its overall LOOK, and for the convenience of door to door shipping at no added cost.)I, however, will only buy engineered wood in person so I can ensure it isn't damaged, rather than dealing with a return or replacement.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M0Y69RQGQG9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NZBBJLU#wasThisHelpful","R2M0Y69RQGQG9F","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What first caught my eye was the rather strange advertising: ""The best diapers for dancing"".  Honestly, that took me by surprise because I'd never heard of the brand before.  Anyway, after realizing that it wasn't a joke I tried them out with my toddler and here is what I found.Unlike the Pampers version I usually prefer, there is no wetness indicator on these.  Not a big deal for a walking child, who cares much less about a wet diaper, but something I am a real fan of for an infant. (-1)No special ""branding"" in particular.  Though I (and my child) really didn't care about ""Elmo"" on the diaper for the first year, let me tell you, he sure does NOW.  These ""Cuties"" have no trademarked figures, and that is fine -they are cheaper without the licensing.  But, if you are looking for Sesame Street figures or Mickey mouse, or whatever, you won't find them here.Build quality doesn't seem THAT different from Pampers.  I studied them side by side, and measured the pads, and stretched the elastic, and I couldn't see any discernible difference (other than the lack of a pee strip, and that the Pampers brand has a light webbing on the inside.  Not sure why that is there, but perhaps it's too keep the wet filled diaper slightly away from the skin?The price is right. Right now these diapers are about 75% the cost of comparable Pampers diapers.  This is a big deal if you are looking to keep the cost as low as possible.  I see no reason for not trying these diapers if cost is an issue for you.The pads are not quite as absorbent as Pampers, but they seem pretty close.  I only detect a very slight difference in thickness, and had I not the Pampers version nearby I might not have noticed.  However, performance has not suffered.  I probably would just not use them as OVERNIGHT diapers.  (I actually use the Huggies Overnights for this.)Overall, these diapers have no noticeable flaws to me.  Were I starting diapers for the first time I'd probably give these (or a similar generic) a shot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E09BUSYQQRWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIQYR12#wasThisHelpful","R1E09BUSYQQRWB","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The base of the heater is at a sharp angle and cannot stand up on its own.  This was done on purpose so that you didn't get the itch to dual purpose this heater and use it as a space heater in another room.  (It is so tall and thin I imagine this would be a fire hazard, as when I tested it on the ground --pointing up-- it did not turn off automatically.  Putting that into perspective, this is a GREAT design.  It's like making a toy too big for an infant's mouth -you effectively design away the danger.  Nice.Anyway, this is a modern looking, and very simple to install heater.  It comes with the required hardware to hang it, and, most conveniently, comes with a temporary/disposable level with holes in ends which show you EXACTLY where to drill the screws so that the unit is perfectly level on the wall.  Very nice.It also is pretty intuitive to use, and comes with a remote control to adjust the heat from across the room.  (And conveniently, the batteries are included).The display on this thing is extremely generous.  HUGE, and I mean HUGE numbers are displayed which you can see from across the room.  This is EXACTLY what I want to see from a heater I have tucked in a well under-heated laundry room in near darkness.The cord on the back initially seems too short but give it a hard pull and it extends a couple more feet.  It is not as long as I would want it, as you have to be pretty close to an outlet to mount it, but I imagine this is also designed for safety.  You cannot have the risk of tripping on the cord, were it to be long enough to touch the floor, because the heater would probably fly right off the wall and crash to the floor.  (Only two screws hold the 9 pound item to the wall.)The heater is pretty quiet and when you turn it off it actually runs for a bit to basically get rid of the excess heat.  Just like some of the modern ovens, the fan will then turn itself off when the core temperature of the heating elements has decreased to a safe level.l I thought the design of this heater to be excellent, and the heater to be very versatile and easy to use.

"I have purchased three (non wood) ""North States Safety Gate"" products in the past, and have used them all over my house to prevent my toddler from going up stairs, and between certain rooms.  These Munchkin gates are very similar in style to the gates that I have but are a higher-end LOOKING gate with basically the same functions. However, there are two main differences: first, the center piece is brown (which is fine), but the other difference is that it is an AUTO-CLOSE gate.  THAT is a nice feature.  I am always closing the gates in front of or behind my child.  (I DO really like this addition.)Personally, however, the auto-close feature is not enough for me to pay 40% more for a gate with the same basic functionality that I have been using previously.Yes, I like Munchkin products -I use their tableware, their silverware, and assorted other items.  However, I think this gate is a little over-priced (and so I only give it 4 stars out of five).However, if cost is NOT an issue, and you really like the wooden centerpiece, then I would say it really is a five star gate.  It is relatively easy to install (once you know what you are doing) and it comes with two extensions which will allow you to put the gate in a wider doorway, or at the top of some wider stairs.  And, most importantly for me, this gate is a pressure gate -which means you do not have to drill holes in your wall, or in your doorway or in your bannister -you can apply these gates, and twist the tighteners over and over -which will extend the gate wider and wider and will eventually cause the gate to lock when closed* and seal most gaps.  (*Note, when you first put the gate in a doorway it looks like something is wrong with it -the opening is way too wide and the gate doesn't lock closed.  This is because you need to tighten the gate at least a couple of inches and then the gate edges {which lock closed} get closer and closer and closer together.  Then, at the end of the tightening you know you are done because the gate locks tight.)Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20FZ52KPI40EY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INT0Y7O#wasThisHelpful","R20FZ52KPI40EY","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is heavy duty duct tape!  From the minute you try to peel it off the roll, to the moment when you start cutting it with scissors, it is abundantly clear that this is some super strong adhesive tape!It is very, very sticky!  It is very, very thick! It is very, very hard to tear! (In fact, you cannot really TEAR it, you have to cut it with scissors.)This is not tape that you want to put somewhere and remove later -this is the tape you use when Armageddon comes, and you need to tape a knife to a broom handle to scare away intruders.  (If you remove the tape later you risk the intruders rushing you when you only have a broom, but more importantly, you will leave a sticky residue on your broom that your spouse will not appreciate when she comes home if Armageddon has not yet occurred! AND, believe me, she really will not care about your Armageddon broom story...)This is the tape that you'd use to tape a pig upside down to the back of a donkey.  No, I don't know why you'd do that, I only mention it in case you HAD to do it --then THIS would be the tape that you'd use.All in all I recommend this tape highly, and it is truly what I would call ""industrial tape"".

"These are a throwback to another era.  They look ""vintage"" and I think they are much more interesting than the standard plastic numbers (that are usually single color, but without any decoration).  Though not perfect, they do offer an alternative to the typical mass produced equivalents of our era, and give your child something else to focus on, other than the numbers themselves.  This is because each of the plywood backed tiles has a specific illustration corresponding to the number written on the wood.  Almost all are animal related (bunnies, flamingos, etc...) but there are a couple of others (people & fruits) which fill out the collection.  This is more important for this NUMBER set, as unlike with the LETTER sets which allow you to make words, you can't really do anything with the numbers other than look at them.  Therefore, I found that the illustrations helped keep interest from my little one, and will probably extend the longevity of these magnets with him.What I didn't like, however, is that the plastic cover of the wooden box broke off two sharp plastic shards almost immediately, and we had to throw the box and its cover to prevent further breakage, or swallowing of the broken pieces.One more thing, since these are thin plywood backed with a vinyl type magnet, they are not very super strong.  If these are scattered on your carpet and you happen to dance across them in the middle of the night -you know, the ""ouch-ouch-ouch-lego-stepping-dance"", you'll hear some bending and cracking.  In my case, though none of the pieces broke, they bent slightly, but I was able to rebend them without too much damage.Overall, a nice alternative to more modern designs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKUK3CAHEVVST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NF04HI#wasThisHelpful","RKUK3CAHEVVST","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used a total of four different brands of car seats in the past, to include Chicco, Evenflo, and Britax (2 models).  And now with this Graco seat I feel I have seen most of what typical car seats have to offer.  I think that overall this is a very good model and one that provides reasonable protection for the money with only a couple of drawbacks, and at a great price that is only about 60% of the cost of the premium models.  It is lightweight, pretty durable, obviously well padded around the head area for side impact collisions, and not complicated to install (though it isn't necessarily EASY to do so).  Other than a harder-than-it-needs-to-be installation, a tough to unhook chest strap, and the lack of a head tether option (when REAR facing) I am pretty happy with this model.PROS:+++ LIGHTWEIGHT.  Very easy to carry.  I didn't feel like it was too bulky or heavy.+++ VERY WELL PADDED AROUND HEAD.  This is comparable to many of the more expensive models.  Very nice.  They did not skimp out on the head protection.  You are getting a safe seat.++ HAS A CUP HOLDER.  For a toddler this is a nice addition, because my little one occasionally drops his water off to the side and can't reach it, and I don't have this option on some of the other seats I have used.++ UNCOMPLICATED INSTALL.  Though you need a lot of strength to pull the final strap it is not complicated HOW to do it.  They did a good job making this simple.CONS:--- DIFFICULT TO TIGHTEN LATCH STRAPS.  Though it is really easy to click on the latch straps, it is a little weird because there is only ONE tightener for both straps.  The strap for one has no tightener, then goes through the seat to the other latch strap on the other side, and THAT side has the tightener.  I feel like I am a pretty fit male and I had difficulty tightening this strap.  I spent five minutes pulling on it, and leaning on the seat, and reading the instructions until I felt confident that THAT really was about as tight as I was going to get it, and that the seat still was going to move a little in either direction.  (This is where the head tether really would have made this seat more secure and further limited movement).  Anyway, you have to press down on the center of the seat as hard as you can, and then pull up on the tightening strap as hard as you can, and it doesn't appear like anything is happening, but it eventually does (but not really noticeably).  I found this unsatisfying, but then, I guess, having only one tension lock is probably why this seat is more affordable.-- HEAD TETHER NOT USABLE REAR FACING. I always use a tether on the top of the seat and hook it to my car ceiling anchor.  This is the most safe installation of your seat, and really prevents the seat from moving from side to side, and will take most of the stress off of the seat in a collision, as the straps act like springs to break a lot of the impact.  However, instead of two straps hooked to the top back sides of your car seat which cross around the front and meet in a ""v"" on top of the seat (and away from your child's head) this seat only has a single strap directly OVER the seat, which means that it is physically not possible to use a head tether with this seat in the rear facing mode (and the seat instructions say that the tether CANNOT be used REAR facing).  (For a point of comparison, my instructions for another brand of car seat say ""NEVER use the seat without the head tether, as the full safety protection is diminished otherwise. This is just a ""scare"" warning, but interesting nonetheless.) The lack of the head tether renders the seat much less desirable to me, personally, for a child under two years, unless it is only for occasional (and not daily use).  However, once you turn the seat around the head tether goes backwards, and works fine.  I personally really don't like this design, because your seat moves a lot more without the tether and any side to side movement is less safe than no movement.-- DIFFICULT TO RELEASE LATCH STRAPS.  Instead of a push/click latch release, these latches are hooks with tension bars.  This means they latch on really easily and safely, but if your latches (like in some cars) are really buried down in the seat, it is difficult to get your fingers in there and depress the tension bar to unclick your latch.  If this going to be a problem for you I recommend buying another seat like any of the Britax models (which have a very simple latch release system).- CHEST LOCK TAKES A LOT OF FINGER PRESSURE TO UNLOCK.  I did not like this; I had to pinch the heck out of the buckle to unhook it from my child, and it was a lot harder to do than with more expensive models.  I really hope they re-engineer this piece in newer models.Overall I would give this seat 3 STARS.  It is not a bad seat at all, but its difficulty in unhooking, and without a top tether (when REAR facing), I wouldn't buy it for daily use (unless using a top tether is just not practicable in your car, or for you, for whatever reason).  However, if only using it FORWARD FACING, I give this seat FOUR stars, as the overall safety is excellent in that direction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNKGF0Y3DP3SW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PTL3TKI#wasThisHelpful","RNKGF0Y3DP3SW","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw a commercial potato slicer once, it looked pretty similar to this and was permanently mounted on the side of a wooden table in a kitchen.  That thing was more heavy duty, and had a larger mouth -and it would cut whole potatoes in one smooth motion; no trimming or precutting required.  It was so easy to do repetitively that there was a bucket below it to catch the dozens or so of potatoes that were cut to make the house fries.  Unfortunately, though, THIS is not that same quality.  Do not be misled.  This is an amateur version at probably 1/3 the price.I was really only interested in juicing, but when I looked at this as a potato cutter, I was still disappointed.  I already have a hand potato dicer which I got at  the cost and it does the exact same job as this one, though the leverage on the large one makes it a lot easier to use.  But my big complaint still stands -the mouth is not large enough to consistently cut potatoes in one go.  You have to slice them in half to really ensure success, and this seems like a waste.  For the money you pay the mouth should have been a little bigger.  But, that is the price you pay when you try to make a machine that does 3 things.  Had it been a dedicated potato cutter, you probably would have had a better machine.On to the apple cutter.  Though it seemed to work fine, I thought switching the attachments was a little bit of a hassle.  They could have made it simpler, and spent a little more time designing the machine to be really user friendly.  It worked fine, but I didn't see much advantage over the flat apple corer that I keep in my drawer.  I mean, it isn't like I need to ever cut more than one apple at a time, so I didn't think this function made much sense.And finally, the juicer.  This is where the machine did well.  The attachments are a lot simpler to use -the bottom just twists and locks in place intuitively and the juicer is mostly effective.  A couple of the oranges looked like they had a little wasted pulp, but when I tried to get the last little bits out it really wasn't worth it for the effort required.  I must say, finally the machine lived up to what I expected.  I had no issues in juicing, and the machine was heavy duty and stable.Other notes:The machine is very sturdy.  It is cast iron, and you can tell.  It is not going to tip over or snap when you use it.The grip is made of rubber which is nice for comfort, and for non-slippage.The cast iron is enameled.  This will make it less likely to rust.The rubber pad on the base is easy to take off for cleaning.  It really took no effort.Final thoughts: overall I thought it not perfectly suited to potato cutting, and it didn't make sense to me for apple coring, but when it came to juicing it did a pretty good job. I would not recommend it for those who really want to make fries, but if you want to juice, it might be worth a shot.UPDATE:It is now a couple of weeks since I started using this and I have to bring up another observation.  I just used this to cut smaller red potatoes into strips. Although initially very excited that it seemed to be cutting pretty on the smaller than usual sized potatoes I quickly had a much less favorable impression.  This is because the blades actually shaved off pieces of plastic when I depressed the handle all the way, and I had to spend 10 minutes searching for the 6-8 tiny pieces that came off and attached to the side of the starchy wet potatoes.  AAAAAAAAAAH!!!!! What a downer.  I realized this occurred because the blades do not align perfectly with the other side of the equation, the plastic PUSHER piece.  There is a little too much wiggle when fully tightened, so that sometimes when the blades comes down they don't quite come down easily.  This is a MAJOR disappointment and I must say that I'll probably never use it as a potato cutter again, only a juicer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HCCSFYNHHMKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQ47FFS#wasThisHelpful","R2HCCSFYNHHMKA","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my third Britax car seat, and I have been using the others for a couple of years, and I now have this newer model, the G.4.1., which I have been using for about a month.  (Honestly, though, I really don’t see much difference AT ALL between the two.  Well, aside from one obvious one.  The color of the handle and a couple of other parts on the 4.1 are bright red.  It appears that this was done for style purposes, and possibly to draw your attention to some of the moving parts so you can figure it out more easily.  Other than that, however, I don’t see any advantage of one over the other, though I suppose the 4.0 model is probably now discontinued.)I (so far) have only used it rear facing, and (when not in a rental car) I use it with the top anchor strap which hooks to the rear ceiling of my car.  I use it both in a Honda Civic and a Honda CRV and it fits fine in both in the center seat, with just enough room for people to sit on either side.  (Unlike with the most expensive model of Britax seat, which has additional special side impact protection –and juts out to the sides- this seat fit without cramping the space of the other rear passengers.)One note about the anchor strap (which attaches to the top of the car seat, and hooks either to the ceiling of your vehicle, the back of the car seats, or the floor of your vehicle):  In the CRV there is easily enough space to put in and take out my child without undue effort (below the anchor straps).  In the lower ceiling Civic, however, it is a tighter fit, and I usually have to lift my son up and bring him horizontal above the seat before I put him in (because it is tricky to insert him under the ceiling anchor straps).  He doesn’t mind at all, but I imagine this to be a little more difficult for my wife when she drives my car –but not a concern at all in the larger car.  (To be clear, though, this is in no way a car seat issue, but rather a make of the car issue…) I tell you all this because I am a real fan of the anchor strap.  The seat doesn’t wiggle at all from side to side, and I can totally visualize how this V strap is going to hold the car seat perfectly in place in an accident, while still allowing needed movement to cushion the blow.  There is also going to be a whole lot less chance of car seat failure when using this strap because it will act like a spring and take a lot of tension out of the huge jerk that will occur in a really sudden stop.  (Britax also advertises that the strap will degrade in usage immediately in an accident, to take some of the impact out of the crash.  In other words it will start to tear itself down, and rip and fray, with that energy going to destroying the strap and not the car seat… kind of like the crumple zone in the front of the car…)What about installation? Well, I’ve installed it about a dozen times and after the first couple of times I had no issues.  It is a little heavy but you are paying for a really solid protection system for your child, and that is the result.  If you buy a cheaper seat it will be lighter, but it might not give as much protection, OR, the seat may not be as easily adjustable.  That said, I always use the LATCH system and I find it works really well.  It IS a little tricky, though, when you have taken out your car seat and you proceed to reinstall it in a different car (or in the same car at a later time).  This is because you now have to loosen the straps holding the latch anchors enough to allow you to clip them back on, but if you are not installing the seat frequently, this won’t be a big deal.  (On the flip side, however, this seat has never loosened, so I don’t worry about re-tightening it all the time.  A few minutes of annoyance in loosening straps and retightening them after the latch anchoring, and this car seat works like a dream).Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely.  (However, I slightly prefer the Pavilion over the Boulevard, because the ‘Click Safe’ feature works pretty well –but I can live without it.)

"I like it.I recently bought a new couch which had been treated with a stain resistant spray.  The problem, though, is that even though it was in an empty back room and had been airing out for a few weeks, it still seemed to have a slightly stale, funky smell.  However, I sprayed the couch with a light to medium amount of spray (because I worried a little about overdoing it and possibly staining the new fabric), and left it alone in the back room for a full week.  When I came back the couch didn’t have the ’off’ odor, but did have telltale traces of the pleasant Febreze smell.  So, for me at least, it worked.There are two things that are not perfect about it, though, but which are pretty minor.  First, it is super expensive –twice as much as I thought it would be- but probably because it is still under patent protection, and they can charge what they want (with no generic brands yet using the proprietary odor reduction technology).  I do think the product works, and isn’t simply just covering up a nasty smell with a more overpowering “nice” one.  (In my opinion, it is too expensive to waste on general house cleaning, so I intend to keep it for when I need to bring out the ‘big guns’, like the day before a party, or when relatives come over to stay…)Second, you have to take a little care when using the product –it is not aerosolized so you have to manually “spritz” it to get it to release the mist, and have to apply just the right amount of pressure so as to not overpower the nozzle and cause drippage of the really powerful scent.  (The downside would be that this drip might possibly stain what you are spraying.)Overall, however, it seemed to work well, and I would buy this in the future to eliminate annoying odors on trouble areas of furniture in my house.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29DR9JJ11ALOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMVCIW#wasThisHelpful","R29DR9JJ11ALOV","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first OXO product that I felt was junky.  I've had a much higher quality OXO (side opening) can opener for many years and I thought this (top opening) can opener was significantly inferior.  In fact, I was quite surprised at how little this reminded me of the typically superior OXO brand.So, OXO is known for being a simple to use, high quality, and expensive product most usable by old people or those with arthritis.  For those not in these two categories this product is just easy to use and a good buy.  Unfortunately, however, I felt that this product fell a little flat.  The handles (instead of the typical grippy soft rubber) are, instead, hard plastic, and the cutting mechanism is no more than average.For the first time I was not able to differentiate an OXO product from generic items from other manufacturers.  There was nothing about this that lent itself to feeling grippy, to feeling high quality, to feeling like ""yes, I spent a lot of money on this, but it is clearly superior"".  This product just felt like nothing worth mentioning.  It is a can opener -decidedly average, and bright light blue.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBGIH919X8D1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X22LC#wasThisHelpful","RBGIH919X8D1E","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are well designed: simple, easy to clean, and colorful.  They also work.  However, since we haven't forced the sippy cup to trainer cup transition, my son tried these for a while and went back to the sippy cup, because these were a little more work that he was used to.  That said, when we make the move permanent, we'll consider getting some more of these and use them exclusively, while retiring the sippy cup.One thing, it isn't as if the liquid just flows out of the cup effortlessly.  Basically the child needs to use about the same amount of suction as it would with a straw (between two really close rows of plastic) and the liquid comes out, breaking the tension that holds the liquid in the cup.  When the suction stops, so too does the liquid.  The other thing, your child needs to know how to suck.  My child had no idea how to use the cup even though he'd used cups with straws before.  I had to show him for a couple of minutes where he had to put his lips, and how he had to get the liquid.  It wasn't a big deal, and he had it down within a minute, but it isn't as if the liquid flowed without conscious effort or thought.I like the handles on this version.  I can really see using these at the dinner table when handles get messy and the cup gets slippery, but I'd also buy ones without handles to use without food.  (The handles are permanently attached with these cups, so you'll have to buy the other version if you don't want them.)Overall I'd recommend these.  I have no real issues, and I like the brand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA0EC9F1M8BSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRZIFD0#wasThisHelpful","RA0EC9F1M8BSF","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very ecofriendly and made with ingredients that are very low on the `parent worry' scale.  I don't know if I would purchase them myself because of the slightly annoying packaging, but more so that they weren't as wet as I would have liked, but they were definitely high quality.PROS:+++ NO ARTIFICIAL COLORS OR SCENTS.  I want as few scents and artificial ingredients in my products, and these fit the bill nicely.++ NICE, SOFT TEXTURE & THICK.  They really are velvety smooth, and I wasn't worried about any abrasion.  I never felt that the quality of the wipe was ever in question.+ THEY ARE A GOOD SIZE.  Yes, they could have a bigger package, but their somewhat slim size makes it a lot easier for me to dump a pack in a diaper bag and not have to worry about using some tiny travel pack which has already lost all its moisture.CONS:-- DISLIKE THE OPENING ON THE PACKAGE.  There is only a plastic piece of tape that you open and close over the opening.  Technically, it works, but I much, much, much prefer the snap/click openings of other brands.  I find that I can't leave a partially pulled out wipe to be pushed back in (with the lid closed on top of it) like I can with other brands; I need to pull that last wipe out entirely before I can seal the package.  After reflection I suppose the design of the package may also have been done like this to be as ecofriendly as possible, and I respect that.  I didn't lower my rating on the product because of this, since I probably would get used to this `new normal' over time, and probably wouldn't notice it as much down the line.- COULD BE A LITTLE WETTER.  I wish they were just a little wetter.  I found myself having to wet the wipes sometimes to get the cleaning power that I wanted.  Sometimes when I had to scrub more than I liked to clean some dried poop  I felt I was going to cause abrasion without additional wetness.  This was rare, but memorable enough to be noticeable.- A LITTLE PRICEY.  You get what you pay for, though.  No complaints regarding the quality or the safety of the product.I love that it is fragrance free.  I like that it is compostable.  I can get over the price, but I'm not sold on the container packaging.  Worth trying, though, if you want an ECO friendly solution -they may work for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G3IT70QMIP6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXGQ8C2#wasThisHelpful","R3G3IT70QMIP6D","A3I1BJIFFM4S21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I1BJIFFM4S21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am totally surprised by the rave reviews this book got.  Let me say that I am a horror story lover and was a Mark Lukens fan since Ancient Enemy.  If you look at the reviews, you will see that Ancient Enemy hooked a lot of readers.  This is my fourth book by Mr. Lukens and I'm sorry to say my least favorite.  He has not ever come close to the suspenseful horror of that book.  I read The Exorcist's Apprentice, to which I gave 4 stars.  It was interesting, but lacked the kind of terror that the plot should have contained.  Then I read Night Terrors, which read more like a thriller, with supernatural overtones, rather disappointing, to which I gave 3 stars.  I was tempted to give this book only two stars, but gave Mr. Lukens an extra star, just because it was him and because the book held my interest, somewhat, even though I found it getting sillier and sillier.  I like stories of people who wake up not knowing who they are and trying to solve the mystery.  Good beginning.  He is led to a town where a past serial killer has killed many people and then himself.  The people he encounters are somehow spooked out by him.  So far, so good.  He meets a girl and they really hit it off and begin to fall in love.  Okay.  But, and I really hate this, every other chapter or so is involved with a dream about a cut-up scary man with mutilated fingers, dripping blood, wanting to show him the answers he is looking for.  I find this touch, and the way it was handled, very melodramatic and clichéd.  He is delivered a suitcase that may solve who he is and he puts it under his bed and never looks into it.  Really?  Then he finally decides who he is and we get to the totally ludicrous ending, where people become other people and the silliness just abounds!  That made me really angry and tempted to give this 2 stars.  Totally stupid ending.  Even the characters, themselves, were just cardboard stereotypes.  I am being generous in giving 3 stars, and may decide to stop getting books by this author.  He just doesn't seem to have lived up to the promise of Ancient Enemy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LQCBIS47FCNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNEOHKU#wasThisHelpful","R3LQCBIS47FCNQ","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually like to write my review early on, but this month found me finishing a book I was in the middle of, so I didn't get to this choice right away.  Besides, I was burnt so badly with last month's choice that I decided to read some reviews before I made my choice. But I was unprepared for how quickly this book would get so many reviews and such rave ones. That made it a no-brainer for me as to which book to choose. I generally don't go for political thrillers, but the politics in this book, though crucial to the plot, actually are not present through most of the book. The themes of computer hacking and chasing after clues trump actual politics through most of it. Computer geeks who love mysteries will really go for this book. Reading the other reviews, there's not much left to say to add to them. It is important to me to like at least one of the main characters. The main character of Gibson Vaughn is so likeable, and his quest to find his missing 14-year old friend, Suzanne, who disappeared 10 years ago, is so absorbing and grabbing, that I found myself glued to this book. As had been said, the characters are well-developed and this is no formula thriller. The twists and turns leave you guessing continually. Often, I don't care as much for a book, if it gets too complex that I get totally confused. Not so here. With all its twists and turns, everything fits into place and I never had the feeling of being lost or confused. It is a complex puzzle that is simply amazing to behold, a joy to follow and never leaves you in a state of frustration. This is one of the best Kindle Firsts I have ever read and I am so glad to have chosen it. I can't believe that this a debut novel for Mr. FitzSimmons. Bravo to you!  You have created a winner. We Amazon Prime members were lucky to have been able to read this, and for free no less. This should be a hard-cover best seller at all the book stores. Fellow readers - if you haven't picked a Kindle First yet for this month, and love thrillers, please read this book.  It's a winner!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YTU1GSL3NNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YTXTIDO#wasThisHelpful","R1YTU1GSL3NNK","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I have to say that, although a horror fan, I am not a fan of zombie books.  I watch the Walking Dead mostly because my girlfriend loves it and I've gotten attached to the characters.  But this is a zombie book like no other.  It takes place after the zombie apocalypse has already taken place and two key figures are going on trial, while a new threat suddenly emerges. one that could wipe out the planet.  It is an unusual and welcome change of pace for this genre.  I enjoyed it, surprisingly.  The characters were well-developed and the action was well thought out and suspenseful.  I subtracted a star because I found some dead spots in the action.  The protracted portion where they were leaving the city in search of the lab was very boring, in my opinion and dragged on.  It could have used a lot of editing.  Likewise the love scenes.  I didn't read this for the romance and I think that if you're going to write a suspenseful horror story, you should minimize the sex scenes.  We could have gotten the fact that they loved each other without so many intimate details.  This is not a romance book, and I skimmed through most of that.  Otherwise, this book was a lot of fun.  Just to comment on one other reviewer's criticism about aspirin, I have a perfectly normal friend who gets sleepy from aspirin and these people have had hardly any medication available to them.  I don't think it's far-fetched.  Though the ending indicated more to come, and I see there are others in this series, I will probably stop with this book, as I mostly read free books (mostly Kindle Firsts and Lender's Library) unless given a gift of Amazon dollars.  You can certainly go on to the other books in the series, but I think this works okay as a stand-alone (as long as you understand that more goes on in this story).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBNV7QA1YDNMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ERVTFCM#wasThisHelpful","RBNV7QA1YDNMP","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying that this is the first pedometer that I have ever used. I was looking for something cheap that would count my steps and tell me the distance I have walked. I haven't been able to make a test of just how accurate it is, but subjectively, it seems quite accurate. It not only tells me my steps, it tells me the distance I have walked, how many steps were aerobic, the average walking speed, the calories burnt and possibly more I'm forgetting. It has a belt clip that works fine, but I would get the strap they recommend to go with it, as I've found that if I sit or bend a certain way, it can come off of the belt. It runs on batteries, so I also got the pack of batteries that they recommend. I am totally satisfied with this pedometer. Cheap, accurate (from what I can tell), easy to use (you just have to put in some information, like your weight and height, and calibrate your stride (which was not difficult). It resets itself automatically every midnight and shows you the past week, so you can compare days. It is so cheap and effective, I could not be happier.

"Let me say I was a fan of Mark Lukens after reading Ancient Enemy, to which I gave 5 stars. I thought it was a terrific supernatural thriller. Even to the end, it had a lot of guessing and things left unsaid. I love that. I next read the Exorcist's Apprentice and really liked that one, too.  I don't remember if I gave that 4 or 5 stars. I was expecting as much with Night Terrors. In fact, I have a whole bunch of Mark's books on my wish list. I intend to read The Summoning, next. So this 3-star review is somewhat a statement of my expectations of Mr. Lukens, as it is an overall rating. I didn't feel it was up to his best. Understand that 3 stars means I thought it was okay. It is not a very negative review. I just expected more. Though there was the supernatural element (somewhat) in that the protagonist, Tara, had psychic powers and especially connected with the killer and his killings. But after that it really was a typical serial killer suspense novel. It followed a very formulaic plot and I even guessed the killer way ahead of time. It was not that hard, if you've read a lot of thrillers. The writing was good. The characters were fine. The idea was a bit cliché and that already made it hard to stand out. Given the premise, I'm not sure what he could have done differently, but it read like many other thrillers I have read. Not to say it was not enjoyable, just a bit too predictable and pat. And far from the supernatural mystery of Ancient Enemy. If you're looking for an easy read serial killer book, with psychic overtones, you may give this four stars. If you've read many of those kind of books and you're looking for something like Ancient Enemy, go with my 3 stars. It's okay, but not great. I really feel bad giving Mr. Lukens only 3 stars and hope for more from the next book of his. (I guess I'm in the minority on this review.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E2ZVQMS0P1MU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M66IU3U#wasThisHelpful","R2E2ZVQMS0P1MU","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually only give one star to books that are so amateurish that I'm am totally embarrassed to read them. Books that sound like they are written by a teenager, without any training. Otherwise, I usually give at least two stars. I can't do that, in this case. I really hated this book.  I wish that I had not been so impulsive as to picking a book the moment they came out. If I had waited a day, I would have read the review by C.R. Hurst, a top-100 reviewer and amply qualified as a writing instructor and student of literature. He said this book was bizarre, incomprehensible, long-winded and pretentious. I totally agree with him, with the exception that, though not understanding the extremely technical scientific jargon, I was managing to get the gist of the story, even though written in such a strange and confusing manner. Unfortunately, unlike him, I did not give up. I thought that all of this intelligent, albeit indecipherable, writing would eventually lead to a wow of a climax. I not only found reading this book to be thoroughly torturous, but found the ending to be the most disappointing and confusing ending I have ever encountered. If you read some of the other reviews, you see that even the good reviews said this was no pleasure book, no walk in the park, but very demanding stuff. I didn't read all of the reviews, but one that gave spoilers obviously didn't understand the ending and had various interpretations. After the torture of reading this pretentious novel which, by the way, read more like a textbook than a novel, I should at least have had the pleasure of a profound ending.  No such luck. If you are one of the lucky ones that have not yet picked a book, please skip this one! That is unless you love difficult, bizarre, pretentious and totally confusing books with no ending. Well, on the good side, it is over. I can go on to something enjoyable. That would be pretty much anything other than this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBBPASUSPRLTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMBGZFQ#wasThisHelpful","RBBPASUSPRLTM","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though these are not my cup of tea, and I didn't care for them, I am reviewing this for readers who take to this genre.  I like horror and often get free horror story anthologies to read at the end of each month, when I am through with my Kindle First and Kindle Prime Lender's Library books.  My favorite was Tales From the Mist.  Other collections proved to be more flash horror stories, very short, dark and pure shock value.  While these three stories, all concerning witches, were a bit longer than the usual flash stories, they were similar in style.  Not what I generally like.  The writing was good and the reading easy, but really for pure dark shock value.  If you like that kind of thing, give this four stars.  The second one bothered me in that it had no ending.  You were supposed to imagine what happened.  The other two were not bad for the genre.  I prefer longer, more developed stories that are not as dark and shocking.

"I've read some of the other reviews of this book and agree to a large extent.  So this review may seem redundant.  I had written to Amazon a couple of years ago, complaining that ""If I Never Get Back"" is not on Kindle.  It has been one of my favorite books.  I think last year or this year they put it on Kindle and, when I discovered it, immediately bought it and reread it.  I knew he had also written this book, but had no idea it had anything to do with the first book.  Then I discovered it was a sequel to the first.  Even though I read the reviews and knew, generally what to expect, I got it anyway.  I agree with the reviewer who said that this is best for those who have read the first book.  It is really a continuation of that, and might not stand up so well on its own.  This could get no less than four stars from me because the writing is quite good and so are the characterizations.  I knew there was less baseball in this, but didn't realize that there was virtually no baseball in it.  Likewise, it (by definition) lacked the aura of suddenly discovering yourself in the previous century and having to adapt to it and learn about it.  It lacks much of the charm of the first book and reads more like an adventure book and love story.  Instead of baseball being the focus, there are train hoppers, Indians, striking miners, Molly Maguires, hucksters and the bad guys from the first novel.  Mark Twain is visited again and even given advice on writing Tom Sawyer.  If you take it for what it is, it is an excellent novel, though I think you have to have read the first one.  I just missed the charm and the baseball theme of the first one.  The main reason for reading this is to see the outcome of the love story and how Sam Fowler's life finally finds it's way.  I hope I have been of some help, even it it's only to corroborate what others have already said.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BNK8KQX8W2BD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZZKS2G#wasThisHelpful","R1BNK8KQX8W2BD","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will not write one of my usual long reviews.  This was simply one of the best horror novels I've read on Kindle, since Andrew Van Wey's ""Forsaken.""  Unfortunately, I did not have a lot of reading time and had to read this over a week or more.  As it has various stories that all tie in, it is best to read this in a short time.  Bentley's writing is quite good and he does a good job of shifting between the first and third person narration.  Sure, it's reminiscent of some of King.  Dan's (the protagonist's) brother, Barbie, a mentally damaged individual with special powers, reminded me of Duditz in Stephen King's ""Dreamcatcher.""  But this was an excellent book in its own right.  The characters were well drawn and the individual stories that finally come together at the end were truly horrifying.  Someone said, in their review, that this was his first book.  If so, bravo.  It seemed like it was written by a veteran horror writer.  I wholeheartedly recommend it to horror lovers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32LWUVIBMI7P3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SNW3EZA#wasThisHelpful","R32LWUVIBMI7P3","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually write long reviews, but I'll try to be brief, here (never happens). I was unsure which Kindle First to pick, as several seemed promising. I love cases with amnesia and past mysteries to solve, so I chose this. Let me say that 3 stars is not a bad review. It just seems bad when so many books get 4 stars and up. I found this book passably enjoyable and was not unhappy I chose it. I would not give this a negative (one or two star) review. But after getting a bit into it, I decided it would definitely not be a rave 5 star book. The story moved along at a good pace. But I had some problems with it, and opted to go for only three stars. First of all, I didn't care for the bouncing around between many different characters from chapter to chapter that the book started out doing. A lot of books do that, but I find it annoying. It settled down a great deal later in the book and didn't jump around as much. Then, there were two male involvements with the heroin Kate/Catelin. The sparring between the two I found very annoying. Then the book got extremely complicated, with so many characters (most of them seedy), that I actually forgot, at the end, how some of them even played into the story, and had to go back to get the picture. You also had to suspend quite a bit of disbelief. Finally, I was not happy with the ending, not who lived and who died, simply Kate/Catelin's decision. Sounds like I had a lot of problems with the book, but it was not that bad. It moved at a fast pace and was reasonably interesting, just not one of my favorite thrillers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRMCK8ZDQOM8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXY7HK0#wasThisHelpful","RRMCK8ZDQOM8T","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I agree with C.R. Hurst, the first reviewer I read, that this was a difficult choice for a Kindle First.  I was not interested at all in the dysfunctional family drama, the legal thriller which looked a bit boring to me, and the silly-looking teenage supernatural hunter book one of a series.  That left this psychological thriller as the only choice.  It is really misnamed as a psychological thriller, as it should really be labeled as a romantic thriller.  I was not totally unaware of this, having read the summary and editor's review, but I was hoping that the romance would be downplayed.  I was wrong.  This was a romantic thriller, through and through.  Not really my style.  So if you like romance, drama relating to love-hate relationships of fathers and sons, fathers and teenage daughters, etc., and like a serial killer thriller mixed in, this is a book for you.  By romance, I'm talking the whole nine yards - she noticing his biceps, deeply tanned skin, masculine appeal and yearning for what she has denied herself all these year, etc., this is it.  As another reviewer said, this book was similar to ""The One That Got Away"" in it's plot of the one serial killer victim that escaped, but with serious PTSD which she fights to overcome.  I also agree that this one was richer in its plot and character development.  But I think it has too many flaws to get the full five stars.  It is ridiculous that a just retired cop would lure the killer he still believes to be on the loose to the home of the victim that got away (not going into how he knew that) and not warn her or anyone else there of the danger. I don't buy his disease as affecting this decision and being a good excuse.  I also think that the playing out of the plot was somewhat predictable and the ending too pat.  The characters were well-drawn, but too formulaic to me. I was also frustrated with the way characters knew things that they kept to themselves, when being open about their knowledge and their feelings might have solved a lot of things.  I find that type of plot line too frustrating.Yet, there are many readers who love books about strong female lead characters that overcome tremendous odds to survive.  Many eat this kind of book up. If that is your thing, then this book is for you, if you don't mind the drawbacks I mentioned.  It is a plot line that has great appeal to many readers and if you are one of those, consider this a four-star, or even five-star, review.  I also agree that there was rich texture in the depiction of the surroundings, which is the rugged Canadian northwest, which adds flavor to the book.  I was certainly not bored with it and three stars is not a negative review.  The writing is good, though not extremely incisive, and it holds your interest.  I really don't think it covers new ground, though.  So, in the end, don't go by the number of stars I gave this book, go by the things I've said about it, and the other reviews you've read and if this is your kind of book, go for it.  But if romance is not your thing, skip it.  This is not a true psychological thriller, like the ones by Andrew E. Kaufman, which are generally darker in nature, and without the romantic involvement.  I hope I've been helpful in your decision-making.  Good luck.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V10FMK8860U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PG8UCGS#wasThisHelpful","R3V10FMK8860U","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying that I'm a big Andrew Van Wey fan, even though he hasn't written all that much, yet.  I was hooked after reading Forsaken.  It is one of my favorite horror novels.  I immediately bought all of Mr. Van Wey's books.  His writing is so mature, so developed, as if written by a much older and more experience writer.  He reminds me so much of early Stephen King (when he was still writing horror).  This short novella fits that statement very well, reminding me of ""It,"" even though this is about 120 pages and ""It"" was 1400 pages.  It is about three young boys I would say about 10 years old.  The beginning is character development, which Van Wey does so well, much like King.  Then they go up to the tree house and the horror begins.  Even though it's about young boys, this book is definitely not a young reader's book, but a book for adults who don't mind seeing through the eyes of young boys.  The ending took me by surprise.  Let's say it's darker than King.  But he gives you the choice of stopping at that ending or going on to Book Two.  I already bought that, so I definitely will.  My only disappointment is that there will be apparently a Book Three and a Book Four.  I prefer stand-alone novels to series' that may go on and on.  Of course, I'm going to have to read all of them.  Andrew, please write another book like Forsaken!  But for a short dark horror, this is great (and you can go on, if you want to.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22A9U08ELP38I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XWXHT8#wasThisHelpful","R22A9U08ELP38I","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just finished A. G. Riddle's Departure as a monthly Prime Lending Library book.  In one sentence I loved this book.  I won't go into all of the plot details, since you're probably read them in both the plot summary and many other reader reviews.  I loved the premise, loved the plot development and loved the characters.  I will compare this to Manney's Revolution, which I just read prior to this, as a Kindle First.  They were both sci-fi novels and both included elite clubs with global aims and main characters that either want to thwart them or join them.  But where I gave Manney's novel only two stars because I thought it was overly technical, overly wordy, totally far-fetched and with a main character that was not so likeable, I thought this shorter book was much more enthralling.  (I have to admit that, inexplicable to me, Revolution got very good reviews.)  It was shorter, much less caught up in its own brilliance and technology, and had characters that you got to care for.  That made a big difference to me.  I am certainly not a romance novel lover, but the romantic involvement and the emotions in this book made it far more interesting to me.  One reader said that he lost interest as the characters' emotions gained importance toward the end of the book.  I didn't find that.  My only criticism was that the ending was a bit too mamby-pamby and lacked the impact I expected from this high octane plot.  Nevertheless, I still loved this book and highly recommend it to sci-fi lovers who don't mind a bit of romance and emotional involvements to be mixed in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HTGAZZZ8N063/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEC0LRU#wasThisHelpful","R2HTGAZZZ8N063","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with much of the review written by TooManyHobbies. But, whereas he/she gave it 3 stars, as an okay techno/thriller, I am subtracting a star.  I basically slogged through this book, without much enthusiasm. I am late writing this review, not only because I haven't had much time to read lately, but also because I found it very slow and monotonous, especially the first half.  I agree that the prologue was the most exciting thing in the book. It was just loaded down with too much technical jargon and I never really cared much for the main character, Peter/Tom. I found him too full of himself. He knew he was a genius and didn't hide the fact that he was the smartest person in the room. That really put me off to him. I never felt any emotional connection to the characters (with the possible exception of Talia). The science may have been accurate but it didn't make for good reading, in my opinion. And though it got into some interesting philosophical issues (re Huxley's Brave New World), this came at the very end and was lost in the science and plot turns.  The musical references were tiresome as was the Yiddish (though I have a smattering). Why is the use of songs to reference emotions a good technique, when you need a chapter at the end to explain them? I was even tired, rather than intrigued, with all of the plot twists.  The book may have had a good concept, but needed some serious editing, as it was overlong, overwordy and overblown. I will not be looking for book 2 in this series. I can't imagine why this book got so many good reviews.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU9T1RVFVRQFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OM9OKEC#wasThisHelpful","RU9T1RVFVRQFN","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, let me say that I am a big fan of Andrew Van Wey, after reading Forsaken and A Feast of Rot.  His writing skills are beyond compare.  Mesmerizing!  This is a very well written short story.  Why did I subtract a star?  Because I have come to expect horror from Mr. Van Wey and this is more of a fantasy/morality tale, albeit extremely well-written.  It does come to horror at the end, but I was expecting more.  After Forsaken, which is one of my favorite horror stories, he has raised the stakes quite high.  Next, I will be reading A Hollow Dream, seasons one and two.  It seems that they are a mixture of fantasy and horror, so I will be better prepared.  It also seems A Hollow Dream may become a series.  I am rooting for more books like Forsaken.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VAHXZTUWK8WT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AMJRBLA#wasThisHelpful","R1VAHXZTUWK8WT","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I doubt many people will read this review or be influenced by it.  In general, people who go by these reviews, lean toward the majority viewpoint. That is why I read this book. After reading it, I am completely flawed at the many rave reviews. A really scary book? Please! This book was like a grade B horror movie. I agree with the reviewer who criticizes Mr. Lopez on his writing, saying that he simply tells you things. That is not creative writing and not what is needed here. You're supposed to be scared out of your wits because someone hears the sound of chains and a sickle? You hear the name of The Mangler, and the sounds of chains and sickles so many times that you get immune to them, rather than scared. At times I felt like I was reading a novel for a young adult reader, sort of a Hardy Boys horror story. The writing is just not mature and creative. The characters - even that of the main character, Brandon - are never really developed into flesh and blood people. And the ending is a total cop out. I didn't give this one star because I reserve that for books that I truly hate and have no redeeming qualities. This had possibilities if put in the hands of a genuine writer. If Mr. Lopez wants to write horror he should read some early Stephen King, Andrew Van Wey or Joe Hart.  Don't just throw clichés at us. If you want to read a real spooky book, read Forsaken, by Andrew Van Wey. Sorry, Mr. Lopez.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WGV8RS146OO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTF9OOM#wasThisHelpful","R2WGV8RS146OO7","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read Andrew Van Wey's Forsaken and I had to get his other books and stories. This is the first I've read of those. I was not disappointed. It is a short novel or novella, which is a story that consists of stories within the story. It borders on fantasy, but is truly a horror story. Written in his usual excellent style, the imagery was vivid, the stories within the book fascinating, and the end truly horrifying and mostly unexpected, though I knew something horrible was going to take place. I don't have much else to say except that Mr. Van Wey did not let me down and I'm looking forward to reading his other books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYQS85UKRWH57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A5P6NLK#wasThisHelpful","RYQS85UKRWH57","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has been out for a while and reviewed many times, more eloquently than I can write here.  Just let me say that this is one of the best books I have read in the two and a half years I have owned my Kindle. It is beautifully written and is a tremendous courtroom drama, a suspense thriller and, most of all, a psychological portrait of a family in crisis all seen through the tormented mind of the lawyer/protagonist who is narrating the story. It is powerful and will stay with you for a long time. You will probably want to go back to it and reread sections of it. I suspect not many people will read this review, but if you do, you can't go wrong with this book. The only people who might have trouble with it are those who want non-stop action. This is not an action thriller. It is an intelligently written, thought-provoking book and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7KUD0KSIBY57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050DIWFC#wasThisHelpful","R7KUD0KSIBY57","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed the book, but was hoping for a five star book.  It had a great premise, which you've undoubtedly read about and good characters.  I agree with the reviewers that said this was all about characters, much like Stephen King. But where King's writing is thought provoking and mature, I thought the style of this book, at times, to be a bit simplistic and the plot movements somewhat rambling. Also the ending was not very compelling and was overly abrupt. I think a more imaginative ending was needed along with more exposition on the aftermath. Yet, all in all, it was a very interesting book, with some really mind-blowing action, and certainly quite different from any other books I've read. If you like the premise, then go for it.

"I have been waiting breathlessly for another novel from Andrew E. Kaufman. He had me in the palm of his hand with the first book I read - The Lion, The Lamb, The Hunted.  I immediately read his other books, While The Savage Sleeps and Darkness and Shadows.  He never fails to disappoint me. I believe he is the best writer of psychological thrillers we have today. This book did not disappoint. It was a mind game to beat all mind games.  At times I felt I was in the middle of a Twilight Zone episode. But the wildest episode ever.  It had me coming and going with all kinds of theories. Written in the first person, from the point of view of the protagonist, Dr. Christopher Kellan, it had you seeing and thinking through his eyes, and wondering what in the world was real. I thought, at times, Mr. Kaufman has finally delved into the supernatural.  What a ride!

"I started out, as I was reading this book, believing I would give this five stars.  But, as it went on, I settled on four.  I didn't go lower because I love Mr. Russell's writing.  I think that's what makes the book, rather than the story.  This is the second book with Detective Gideon and his dog partner Sirius, the first one being Burning Man.  I loved that book, and I believe I gave that 5 stars.  I am not a dog lover, but I love the interaction between Gideon and Sirius.  The writing is very humorous.  Also, unlike one critical reviewer, I like Mr. Russell's references to music and literature.  He seems a knowledgeable and intelligent man.  As to his descriptions of LA, I have learned to skim description that I don't find important and don't find that interferes with my enjoyment of a book.  My problem with this book is the misnomer of calling it a mystery.  That is what I expected.  The initial premise is fascinating.  A homeless man, who is actually an intelligent former engineer ruined by alcohol, witnesses what appears to be the murder of an angel.  Finding out what happened there is what I expected to be the mystery.  Instead this veered off into high tech villains, an actress of dubious motives, a reunion with the killer from Burning Man, a Reluctant Hero, and events that unfolded in a very rapid pace towards the end of the book.I think this is more of a thriller/suspense.  I found the events a bit far-fetched and somewhat confusing.  Yet, Mr. Russell's writing kept me sufficiently interested to want to get to the end.  Maybe if this had been billed as a thriller, I might have not been as critical.  I still think this was a good book, but not what I was led to believe.  I think Burning Man and Multiple Wounds were better Russell books.Spoiler:  (The original mystery is never really resolved, except by conjecture at the end of the book.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RGPB4LLG2Y76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2EOOOC#wasThisHelpful","R1RGPB4LLG2Y76","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am clearly in the minority, here.  This book got rave reviews, apparently not only from Amazon readers, but from the literary world alike.  The book is a great period piece and, for those wanting that and some history added to their murder mystery, this might be the perfect book.  I agree with one reviewer that Nell seems to have acquired a great deal of knowledge, unbelievably so, in the four years since she was taken in by the doctor, from the low life she was living, to the point of knowing languages, philosophy, psychology, medicine, what have you.  Hard to believe.  But that didn't bother me.  I just couldn't get into the pace of the book and the constant painting of the period and the people.  Ms. Ryan has clearly done a lot of research and for history buffs who also like a murder mystery, this might be a five star book.  I was somewhat annoyed that Nell never even asked the accused if he was actually guilty until the end of the book.  Anyway, three stars is the best that I could do for this book.

"This is a great little thriller.  It is over a hundred years in the future.  Global warming has taken over and everywhere it is parched and dry.  Man has engineered produce to grow in this climate of little rain.  Yet, progress has been made.  Man has isolated the gene that causes psychopathic killers and they have disappeared (at least from this country).  Yet Sheriff MacArthur Gray, who moved from a big city to a town called Shillings, somewhere in the mid-west, is suspicious over a number of deaths and disappearances that, to him, point to a psychopath on the loose.  Anyone he hints this to tells him he is crazy and not to voice his suspicion or he lose his job, or worse.  No one will take him seriously.  I like the way this protagonist thinks and talks.  The dialogue and writing is very intelligent.  Although the main villain is guessable, I had him on my list of suspects but was leaning in a different direction.  I would give this 5 stars, but I did not care for the climactic scenes.  There was way too much description of the fighting, which went on and on, was not that exciting and a bit unbelievable.  I equate long fighting sequences in a book to car chase scenes in a movie.  They are just not that interesting.  It is the mental games that are played, leading up to them, that are of the most interest.  I also did not like the abrupt ending.  I would have like a bit of an epilogue as to what played out after the final battle.

"Let me start by simply saying I just didn't get it.  This is sort of a fantasy/science fiction/thriller/romance.  I didn't really take to the characters and I didn't find it all that thrilling.  Romance is something I am not interested in reading.  This takes place in some unknown world at some unknown time.  Some things seem behind us in technology and others ahead of us. A lot of things are named in Latin and it takes some time to even understand what some things are, such as the motorcycle Penny (the protagonist) rides, the mechanical butterflies and mechanical horses, etc.  I just didn't take to this fantasy world and found the battle of the good guys against the bad guys confusing and not that interesting.  The only experience that I've had in fantasy is my favorite book, which is Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. This is not that kind of fantasy. I can only rate this based on my own tastes. I picked this book from the Kindle Firsts, because the editor raved so much about it. I do believe that many readers will give this four or five stars, if this is their kind of book. It's not a bad book, just not very interesting to me.  I have to admit, though, that it is different.I just read some other reviews and discovered that this book is in a genre called Steam Punk.  That is where the setting is something like the late 19th century, but there are inventions like those of H.G. Wells, that take us into the future.  I must say that this may be why I found this so confusing.  Now that I know this, I can say that I am not a fan of Steam Punk. I suppose it might have helped had I known the genre before I started. It didn't engage me.  I see it got a lot of high reviews.  I suppose there are a lot of fans of this type of book. So my rating can't be based on how this rates within that genre, as I am not familiar with it, but simply what I thought of it as a book. Boring, confusing and not believable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SLERYL0JVSTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJZ3QV2#wasThisHelpful","R3SLERYL0JVSTW","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I had to retrieve it from the cloud and skim it to remember what it was and why I didn't bother reviewing it.

"I'm not up to writing a long review.  This is a solid courtroom mystery/thriller.  The characters are well-developed.  The dialogue and the courtroom action seem genuine.  I was intrigued and looked forward to getting back to it, after putting it down.  However, it was a bit overlong, at 419 pages, and lacked a real twist of an ending, which I had expected.  Nevertheless, it's a good book and I recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PQMOYTKDPVCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2EOONI#wasThisHelpful","R1PQMOYTKDPVCT","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a great horror/ghost story fan.  Outside of Stephen King, it is often hard to find a good one.  Even Koontz doesn't always fit the bill, often writing good thrillers, but not in the supernatural vein.  I really look for good ghost stories, as I enjoy these more than vampires, werewolves, zombies, and slasher novels.  One of my favorite movies is ""The Changeling"" with George C. Scott.  I'm in good company, as Stephen King, in a documentary interview, named that movie as one that influenced him.  It is not only a spooky ghost story, but has a great mystery back story that unfolds to a tremendous climax at the end of the movie.  This book has the same aspects.  The characters are well-developed.  You really get to feel for Evan and his son, Shaun.  That is an important ingredient in a story.  Then, it has a great back story, that slowly gets unraveled, as Evan does more and more research about the island that he is staying on, thanks to his friend Jason, who let him stay there when he lost his job.  I won't go into the details of the story, as I don't like to give much away, and other reviewers are already telling you much.  But it builds and builds to a whopping climax, that you won't want to put the book down until you get to.  The ending makes perfect sense and doesn't leave you dissatisfied.  If you like a good ghost story, with a good mystery behind it, go for this book.  I am so surprised when I find a good story like this, free for the borrowing, or free for the buying.  Good supernatural stories are rare.  Read this one and you won't be disappointed.I want to edit my review, somewhat.  I still give this book 5 stars (though four and a half would be more accurate).  The ending made sense in the context of the story and didn't leave me angry, but was not the ending I had hoped for.  This, after a comment from Rich B, who said it was not a perfect ending.  I agree, it was not a perfect ending, but acceptable.  As to his comment that it was not really scary, I find that most horror stories can be spooky and creepy, but don't usually scare me, the way a movie can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VB74CJZLRBSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GRJ2BAU#wasThisHelpful","R1VB74CJZLRBSG","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I debated giving this book 4 stars due to one problem I had with it, but since I enjoyed the book so much and really find Jeff Gunhus' writing to be up there with the best of the horror writers, I decided to give it 5 stars.  Oddly, the plot line reminded me a bit of the King book Doctor Sleep, which was a sequel to The Shining, and also involved an evil group going after someone with psychic powers, carried over from the previous book.  I wonder if Mr. Gunhus was at all influenced by King's book.  Nevertheless, it is a powerful book, in its own right and well worth reading by horror fans.  It has just the right amount of blood and gore, excellent pacing, and terrific characters, especially Joseph Lonetree and the evil Mama D. (not to mention Sarah, the main character).  It was a worthy sequel, and this from someone that doesn't care for sequels.  I loved Stephen King's The Shining, but was not that taken with Doctor Sleep.  This book never had me bored and had me eager to get back to it whenever I could.  I read one reviewer's take that you wouldn't understand this if you hadn't read the first book.  I do agree that reading the first book is very helpful.  In fact, I had forgotten some of the first book, and since I had only borrowed it from the Amazon library, I couldn't go back to check some things.  So it is helpful to have read the first book, and even more if you had just read it, or own it to go back to.  On the other hand, the author does make many references to the events in the first book, so it might be possible to read this on its own.  My only problem with the book was the ending.  Not the final ending, which seemed to leave room for yet another sequel, but rather the climactic confrontation (I won't go into detail, as not to spoil anything).  I found it a bit over the top and hard to suspend disbelief (even for horror fans).  A bit too confusing with the out-of-body brain traveling.  But I enjoyed the book so much, that I let that go.  I still prefer the first book and strongly recommend that you read Night Chill.  It is one of my favorites.  But this is a worthy sequel and I think I've rambled enough, so go read both of these - NOW!

"Ian Colmes is having trouble getting over the murder of his son, Alex.  He keeps seeing and hearing him.  Is he going mad, or is he seeing ghosts?  The police have found the murderer, dead, partly from Alex defending himself, but is there more to the story?  Why is Alex back?  This is a terrific ghost story/mystery/thriller.  I loved it.  The character of Ian Colmes is painted with good detail and his life follows a pattern you would expect from what he is going through.  You want to find the answer and you won't put this book down until you do.

"I have to admit that I only read half of the stories, so far.  My rating is solely based on this anthology of horror stories fitting my needs.  And that is to fill up the time between novels, with very readable and diverting stories.  This perfectly fit the bill.  The stories are between 20 and 30 pages and vary quite a bit in their style and content.  But I have found them to be eminently readable and diverting and quite useful to fill in the gaps when I have nothing to read.  They're not all great, but they're mostly okay and the length is just right for short stories.  I have read those 3 page shockers and found them a waste of time.  So if you like supernatural or horror stories, want some stories that are light reading, to fill in the time, this is a good collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FAI509PVNMJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KRKTIW#wasThisHelpful","R2FAI509PVNMJJ","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not often that I don't finish a Kindle book.  Not only did I only get a bit over half-way, but I found myself playing Solitaire to avoid getting back to this book.  This book was definitely mislabeled as a mystery.  It should be called a young adult mystery.  Hail all Nancy Drew lovers.  This is a book for teenagers and I often felt I was reading a book written by a teenager.  It involves two teenage girls attempting to solve a murder mystery, with the aid of a delinquent teenage boy, who grows pot in his back yard, and convinces one of the girls' mothers that he is a private detective, or something of that ilk.  Although the boy's chapters are written in the first person, most of the chapters involve the girls and, though they are written in the third person, you get the feeling that you are reading a book by the one girl, Betty.  You have groundings, boys being dumped or not being dumped, school papers, teenage issues.  I am really dumbfounded by the amount of good reviews this book got.  I can only guess that there are a lot of Nancy Drew fans (or former fans) out there, who liked this sort of thing.  I found it intensely boring and finally gave up after reading 54%.  I really don't care who the murderer turns out to be.  The only admirable thing about this book is the adult way that it handles the fact that Betty has two lesbian mothers.  No big deal about it and handled as a normal fact of life.  Bravo for that!  Otherwise, I found the writing of this not to be on a par with many of the other books I've read on Kindle, even the self-published ones.  If you're into teenage sleuthing (as improbable as it is) and teenage issues, then give this more stars (maybe 3) and go for it.  As for me, I'm glad to take it off of my Kindle, be done with this review, and get on to my next Kindle book, which is a Prime Lending Library book called Alex, and which looks a lot more my style.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YK3XXJPEPX7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2GBJ8U#wasThisHelpful","R1YK3XXJPEPX7D","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would like to have given this book a higher review.  It was written well.  The characters were drawn well with sufficient depth and the protagonist, Jeff Resnick, was a likeable character.  I didn't mind the use of visions appearing to Jeff, as a result of his mugging in Manhattan but don't get the idea that this is a book on the supernatural.  It is simply used as a device in this detective mystery.  My main hangup with this book is that the murderer is discovered early on in the book and the majority of the book is uncovering evidence and more facts surrounding the murder.  I would have liked to have a surprise ending or, at least, an attempt at one.  There was no attempt to hide the identity of the murderer, only the circumstances surrounding the murder.  That took away a lot of suspense for me.  Too bad, because Ms. Bartlett seems a talented writer.  I liked the device of the ESP, but would have liked to have been surprised.  So it's okay, but could have been better.  I would possibly give one of her other books a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNAOHUYW5LCGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001JJBLSQ#wasThisHelpful","RNAOHUYW5LCGH","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would have liked to have been more enthusiastic about this book.  It is not badly written and I have the feeling that Mr. Wier is capable of writing good mysteries.  Unfortunately, this is not one.  The protagonist, Bill Travers (a money launderer who likes to call himself a financial advisor), seems intelligent and likeable, but the characters are not deeply drawn.  You don't feel much for them.  The love affair jumps in right from the beginning and you feel it is obligatory.  But most of all, there is no compelling mystery.  Usually a mystery starts with a murder - or it may contain a series of murders, and you have to guess ""who done it.""  There may be a back story, usually something from the past, that adds even more to the plot.  Unfortunately, this novel's only mystery is ""where is the money?""  Not only that, but everyone, including Bill Travers, seems to know early on, except for the reader.  And who cares anyway?  Yes, there are some killings along the way.  But suspense is never really built and you don't really care about the solution.  Frankly, I found this rather boring.  I am not talking about the style, but the plot, which I find rather weak.  Even the back story from 1927 - who cares?!!  Since mysteries are all about the plot (not to say that the characters aren't important, as well) this lacks the substance of a good mystery.  I'm not going to go into the details of the plot.  It's not worth talking about.  Maybe his later books in this series are better.  Sorry, Mr. Weir.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11K054E4I08XQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QWZCYC#wasThisHelpful","R11K054E4I08XQ","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a reread of this book for me.  I read this book a long time ago, along with Shoeless Joe (the book Field of Dreams was based on).  I loved it then and still loved it now.  It deals with baseball and fantasy, like Shoeless Joe, but is much more enigmatic.  Shoeless Joe ultimately becomes a ""dream come true"" while this leaves you with ideas to ponder on the nature of obsession, dreams, love and reality.  It is still a fantastic and magical trip that takes the protagonist back in time to witness the obsession he has had about the existence of The Iowa Baseball Confederacy in 1908, which only his father and he seem to know about.  It is a delight to read.  It requires extreme suspension of disbelief, as the most fantastical occurrences seem to happen, but go with it and enjoy it.  I won't say more about the plot, as many other reviewers have done so already.  But if you love the game, love time travel and the fantastic, and are willing to question the nature of our loves and goals, this book is definitely for you.  My favorite, though, still remains Shoeless Joe, which I intend to reread next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHTPGGGTMGC7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTHTKY8#wasThisHelpful","RHTPGGGTMGC7Y","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did a whole bunch of research before I settled on this flash drive and I'm quite happy that I did.  I wanted a large capacity flash drive to put on my key chain to carry around my photos and music, should something happen to my home.  My first backup is an external  hard drive which stays in my home.  I wanted something to carry with me at all times and would fit on my key chain.  I already have an Integral encrypted, password-protected flash drive for my documents.  I didn't need encryption for my music and pictures.  I looked in Amazon at many drives.  Many didn't have keychain loops.  Of those that did, this seemed the best.  The similar-looking Kingston Digital Data Traveler had several accounts of the insides falling out.  I didn't want to take that chance.  The San Disk Cruzer Fit seemed very small and more suited for a laptop or car stereo and not to be taken off and put on.  Also the loop seemed too small for my keychain.  The Patriot Pulse Series had one comment that it was not good for a key chain, as the cap would fall off.  Most of the rest were not made for key chains.  I have had this for a while, now, constantly deleting my old picture backup and replacing it with a new one (my music doesn't change that much).  First of all, it feels quite sturdy and fits beautifully on my key chain.  Banging around with my keys doesn't seem to have affected it.  No sign of the insides falling out and never a crash.  It inserts well into both my computer and my girlfriend's.  I am not an expert on speed, but it seems to be on a par with most flash drives. By the way, I took one person's advice that the 128 GB flash drives are not that stable, yet.

"There should be a rating for 4 and a half stars.  I liked this book a lot and was considering giving this 5 stars.  I may still consider it a 5 star book.  I was, however, a bit disappointed in the climax.  But really, finding the main culprit is less the purpose of this book than becoming intimate with the character of Danny Beckett and the need for him to discover who the murder victim was.  First of all, several people compare him to James Lee Burke.  I have not read anything by that author, so I can't compare them.  There have been complaints by some of boring parts.  I find that incredible as this was a short novel, not filled with a lot of extraneous descriptions.  I have learned, on all  of my reading, to skim through description that I think is superfluous.  There was not much to skim here.  As to the criticisms of this as a police procedural, that a cop wouldn't be listening to BBC, or that race wasn't mentioned, or other police procedurals, I think they are missing the point.  This is really more of a character study, both of the detective and the murder victim.  Danny Beckett is intriguing, and I do believe he could be listening to BBC. The mystery was more who was ""Bishop,"" the murder victim, and what was he all about than capturing the bad guy. I was a bit disappointed in the ending, as I expected more. Hence the 4 stars.  But this was a very well crafted book, which I had trouble putting down.  It's sensitive and, I feel, genuine.  I would recommend this to anyone, except those looking for a punch ending with a complete twist that knocks your socks off.  It's not that kind of book, and, if you don't crave that ultimate twist and surprise ending, give this 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S29B1AK9FPWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMOUZCO#wasThisHelpful","R1S29B1AK9FPWN","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had read many reviews before buying this set of horror novels and most said that, though not all of them were winners, there were some that were very good and this was a great buy for 99 cents.  I haven't gone back to look at the reviews, but I have to say that I read many horror books and I truly feel there was not one single real winner in this set. There were some truly creepy moments and a few had you turning the pages, not wanting to put it down, but I feel all of them were, in some way flawed or not up to a really top-notch horror.  I'm giving it two stars, instead of one, because it had some good moments.  Here is a rundown:1. Virgin - this was written in the style of a horror novel, but early on you saw it was religious in its substance.  The story was moderately entertaining and kept your interest, but the ending was pure religious hogwash. Really disappointing ending.  Totally corny.2. Haunted House - I had read several books by Kilborn (Konrath) and, although he is a bit gory for my taste, I was prepared for that and was expecting a really good haunted house book.  First of all, there are a lot of characters and it goes back and forth, so at first it can be a bit confusing.  You do get to know them and settle in for a really good haunted house book.  Once again, the ending totally ruined this book.  The secret behind the occurrences is a big letdown and the conclusion of the book has the feeling that Mr. Konrath just wanted to end this and threw the ending together without a lot of thought.  This could have been much better.3. Wolf Hunt - Forget this one altogether.  I call it ""Waiting for Godot"" meets ""The Wolfman.""  Two thugs are hired to transport, in a caged van, a supposed werewolf to a rich client.  Is it really a werewolf?  Since this is a horror story, I'll give you one guess.  There is carnage galore, so that is not a problem.  The problem is that for the majority of the book, these supposed thugs are discussing, and discussing every little thing as though they were intellectuals.  Totally out of character for thugs and really boring.  It goes on and on, and you can't wait for this book to end.  It is also overlong, especially in the light of the endless repartee.  I suppose you are supposed to find the repartee amusing but I just found it boring.4. Eerie - This book about missing people, including a cop, and a monster under the bed causing weird things to happen, is a real page turner.  I couldn't stop reading this and was all set to give this one top scores.  The action was really intriguing and you cared about the characters.  Then came the most ridiculous ending I can imagine - sort of a cross between science fiction and religion.  Totally ludicrous and ruined what should have been the big winner in this set.  Makes no sense whatsoever.  Give this book a good ending and you have a real 5-star book.5. Speed Dating With The Dead - Believe it, or not, even with this ridiculous title, this one comes closest to a true horror story.  Similar to Konrath's ""Haunted House,"" a group of ghost hunters, or paranormal investigators, set about to investigate the most haunted house in the country.  The manager of the group seems to be only out for money, and not really a believer.  Or is he?  That is one of the problems with this book.  Not a bad book, it is very complicated, with many characters, going back and forth between them, and you don't totally understand the motivation for all of them. Do they believe? Do they not believe? Are they trying to disprove or are they trying to create hoax. A bit convoluted and, sometimes confusing.  But it does come together as a true horror story and has a good ending.  No hogwash.  It could have been written in a creepier style, though.  A bit too matter-of-fact. So, again, not terrific but not bad.6. The Final Winter - I'm not sure what to say about this one. I'm not even sure I how I would rate this on its own.  The entire world seems to be covered by a tremendous snow storm that threatens life on earth.  The story centers around a group of characters in a bar, a supermarket and a video store. The characters were handled in depth and you really got to care about some of them.  There were some truly horrifying scenes and this was a page-turner.  The ending was somewhat satisfying, but again  (note this may be a spoiler for some) veered too much to the religious for my taste in horror stories.  If you don't mind that, then this one was the real winner of the group.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DFOJ0W8VB0WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUUMP8I#wasThisHelpful","R1DFOJ0W8VB0WG","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After reading The Bird Eater, I decided I had found a good horror writer. When I saw this in the lending library, I knew I had to read it. I wasn't disappointed. Ms Ahlborn has crafted one chilling horror story. Almost a bit too chilling. I might have ended it a bit differently. But I don't want to give anything away. This is sort of like The Bad Seed meets The Omen, meets the Exorcist. The characters are well crafted and the plot moves swiftly.

"I am a Prime member and had to choose a free  book for this month.  I couldn't decide between this and the international thriller (whose name I can't recall right now).  I opted for this one because it looked like an easy read and the thriller was very military, and supposedly overdone with military jargon - not my cup of tea.  I didn't expect too much out of this book, but boy was I wrong!  This is an expertly done mystery and thought provoking look into morals and life's meanings.  I am dumbfounded that some reviewers found this book either boring or confusing, or both.  True, it starts off with very short chapters, like small vignettes, but very early moves into more conventional style.  I disagree with those who said it didn't flow.  I thought it flowed beautifully. Rather than jumping from one character and scene to another, as is the current trend, I find this basically follows a linear flow.  True, it is broken up, almost between every chapter, with flashbacks (in italics) to an earlier time relating to the facts behind the murder/accident.  But that only heightens the mystery.Yes, the characters, basically the lead investigator, Franza, are flawed, but that only makes the book more meaningful. Is there a lot of talking and do we go into Franza's head to see what she is thinking?  Yes, but that makes the book all the more real, and I did not find it in the least boring.  No, this isn't action-packed, with a killer on the loose, threatening everyone, including the detective.  It is more intelligent than that.  It is somewhat like a good foreign film compared to an American blockbuster.  What kept me riveted to this book was the mystery behind the girl and the gradual uncovering of her life and the people who were part of it.  I felt it kept uncovering more and more layers, until I couldn't put the book down without finding the terrific conclusion.You don't have to like Franza, or any of the other detectives to love this book.  Sure, there is infidelity that seems to be more accepted than in this country, but that only adds to the reality of this book. The driving force behind the book was the girl and the mystery behind her death.  There seems to be something hauntingly beautiful about her and you want to find out what really happened to her.  There seems to be much more to the story than meets the eye and you sort of know that and can't wait to find out more.  I did not guess the ending and am surprised at the first reviewer who thought it was easy.  I am also surprised at the reviewer who criticized the translation.  How can you do that, unless you have read it in German, or unless it was unintelligible?  On the contrary.  It was highly intelligent and often poetic.  Would I like to see a sequel?  No.  It ended perfectly.  More novels with these detectives.  Yes.  In short, I thought this book was terrific - and to think it was her first adult novel!  Excellent.  Don't pass this one up!  I'm sorry my review may have come too late to get much attention. I wish I could have reviewed it sooner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P1UHIUMEO4QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFEHOOE#wasThisHelpful","R3P1UHIUMEO4QR","AZ289SJ5X4ARV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ289SJ5X4ARV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This so-called horror movie, about a junkie and his friend who's trying to clean him up in an old cabin in the woods, has supernatural events that aren't very scary and an end that leaves you totally dissatisfied.

"I really was looking for a head set versus ear buds for work as we moved to an open floor plan and wanted something that singled from behind that I was in the zone.Positives: Easy to carry/store, foldable, nice sound quality. Easy to adjust. Expands size to fit around larger heads- I actually used the smallest setting on my head- I'd find the set harder to fit on smaller heads (children). Comfortable- compared to ear buds. Cord is wrapped - less tangles than my previous pair of ear buds. Didn't really use the play/pause button but love the idea of the feature.Negatives: A little smaller than my ear so feels a bit weird of a fit- but got used to quickly. It does not cancel out outside noise.No issues with pads or set but it's only been 11 days of use.**received sample at a discounted price for review purposes**","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33MDYY987J6Q6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIBK9NG#wasThisHelpful","R33MDYY987J6Q6","A2YTZFGZ2AASCT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YTZFGZ2AASCT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no idea what tor eally expect when receiving these.Application: Easy to put on, started at the top above my belly button and guided my hand down to avoid wrinkles. Easy to apply- no immediate reaction. It was a cool feeling when applied.Use: I didn't feel anything different while in use. No stiff feeling from the wrap. You do have to wear it for 6 hours. I did this while sleeping and did not experience any adverse effects (or dreams).Removal: This was the tricky part. It hurt... not a lot but it was painful in the areas I have stretch marks from pregnancy. It really sticks tot he skin and doesn't peel... which is great except when it's been 6 hours and in the AM, you are stripping it from your skin.Does it work? I feel like it worked a bit but not enough for me to purchase these regular at $10+ a wrap. If it was more like $2 to $4 per wrap, I'd consider it or if it was $40 a month versus 10 days. I love the idea of a detox wrap with cleansing my diet on Mondays after a rough weekend- just don't have solid proof it's working.**received sample for review purposes**","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCL605X8ZPVP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZAR7VWS#wasThisHelpful","RCL605X8ZPVP9","A2YTZFGZ2AASCT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YTZFGZ2AASCT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second similar looking toilet seat. It was a bit weird with the anti-slamming function. When installing, I thought I had a defective lid but turns out I was reading the instructions wrong. Overall- I love these types of lids- easy to maintain with a toilet training toddler and this one is way better than the last- it stains less and more adult friendly with the  anti-slamming. It's only been about 2 weeks but thus far better than the last.Another note- My son never used the plastic seats you buy at the store and went right to this- Avoid adding another potty to your bathroom and try this first. It worked for my second.... my first I bought too many toddler potties and spent the time to wash it out.

I have used it a total of 13 times and it's been fantastic. Perfect for a room- probably not big enough for a hall without getting a could (which would be awesome having multiples in a room).

"Normally- I buy these at the dollar store but couldn't pass up getting 100 for a discounted price. Overall- worked well... a few didn't glow but 95% did. Brought them down the shore and was a huge hit! They lasted from 6pm (before it got dark) till past bedtime at 9pm... past that I can't tell you how long they lasted but it's what I expected. **received a small discount for review purposes**","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L8K0BWC6HP1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054ZV2US#wasThisHelpful","R2L8K0BWC6HP1J","A2YTZFGZ2AASCT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YTZFGZ2AASCT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a decent bicycle computer, but I also have had some issues with it's readings.  It took me a while to get it sorted out to where I felt it was accurate with the speeds.  I finally got it situated and figured out and I paced it alongside my wife's car to determine if the speed was finally reading correctly or not.  After a couple more minor adjustments on the sensor and magnet, I have it all sorted out and reading where it should.  The device is good, has plenty of functions, but it is a bit tricky to figure out the directions.  Lets just say they aren't the easiest to read.  The device itself is ok made.  I do feel it will break if dropped tho.  I think the case needs to be a bit more robust or it should come with some sort of outer rubber drop proof skin or something of that nature.  I ride off road and it has taken the shock of bumps and jumps quite well I must say.  Pretty tough little unit for as much jarring as I have given it.  Just not drop proof I don't think.  Overall, after some fine tuning, it finally works well enough for me.I received this product at a discounted price for a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26DOHIIT8RJWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R3ZBRW#wasThisHelpful","R26DOHIIT8RJWH","A2BQPAH744QAES","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BQPAH744QAES?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good little solid knife.  It is small and compact and easy to stash.  Can be worn a multitude of ways.  Neck knife, boot knife, strap it to a bug out bag, etc.  I have it lashed to by bug out bag for emergencies.  It works great as an EDC knife or a back up.  It is a full tang blade with a poly plastic handle.  I took some paracord and wrapped the handle for added grip and paracord comes in handy for extra uses.  This has a nice look and feel to it.  Easy grab handle with a finger slot for extra grip and dexterity while using it.  Overall, really good small knife that has a variety of uses as an every day blade or a back up.I received this product at a discounted price for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R57QH1IJ5YLI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJE76YC#wasThisHelpful","R57QH1IJ5YLI5","A2BQPAH744QAES","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BQPAH744QAES?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice tempered glass screen protector. Fit was spot on with this. Both the top and bottom cutouts were precisely placed with no issues. Install was super easy to do with the included prep items. Once lined up and laid down on the phone's screen, this left absolutely no air bubbles. These tempered glass protectors are just so much better than the old film style ones that were such a nightmare to put on. These go on easily and they stay on. Even with aftermarket dropsuit cases and bumper cases these aren't affected. They work together great. The touch response is still exactly as it was without the screen protector installed.

"Very slim slider style case for the iPhone 5.  This doesn't add very much bulk to your phone at all.  Nice textured feel to it.  This is a thin case, so I am not thinking it is going to offer much in the way of drop protection from major drops.  Or how well it will hold up after a few of them.  This is a nice case.  It's decent, but in no way is it a dropsuit case.  It is a minimal, thin case.  It looks good and feels nice in the hand.  Fit is spot on too.  Buttons are cut out in the right spots.  Camera cutout is perfect.  Overall, nice case, just not too heavy duty for big drops.I received this product at a discounted price for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FN8NKMYZC8Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP8G3TQ#wasThisHelpful","R2FN8NKMYZC8Z4","A2BQPAH744QAES","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BQPAH744QAES?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice thin dual layer bumper case.  This is a decent case, but it is not a drop suit heavy duty case.  It works well, is nicely designed and fits really good.  Very easy to install and covers the phone well enough.  This is a light to moderate protection case.  This will do fine for small drops or anything like that.  I doubt it'll save it from anything too high up tho.  I don't think this case can handle that type of drop to be honest.  Granted it is not a cheap case.  It does offer some decent protection for such a minimal thin styled case.  But if you are rough on your phone, you might want to invest in something a little more robust.  Overall tho, it is a nice case that works good.  Very nicely designed and made.I received this item at a discounted price to review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLCT12MAOX6MN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017QSLD40#wasThisHelpful","RLCT12MAOX6MN","A2BQPAH744QAES","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BQPAH744QAES?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great fit for those who want a clear case.  Good fit, and good look.  Easy to install on the phone.  Took all of about 1 minute to get it on and set.  Basically a naked case for your phone just to have extra protection on it.  Seems it will offer some drop protection with it on.  This has no screen protection at all, so I would recommend investing in a tempered glass screen protector too.  All the cutouts for the cameras and buttons are spot on.  They all work good with no issues or obstructions.  Works great, fits great and looks great.I received this product at a discounted price for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L51EHMGFEO6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAOCEFY#wasThisHelpful","R3L51EHMGFEO6T","A2BQPAH744QAES","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BQPAH744QAES?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good case, but it is a little thinner than I expected it to be.  Granted it is a nice bumper case, it does offer some drop protection, but I wish it would have been a bit more robust material wise.  The fit and finish are really nicely done.  Nicely designed and well made, but like I stated, it is a little on the thin side for my liking.  I think it would offer some decent drop protection for the phone, but it isn't a serious drop protection case.  Minor bumps and drops yes, major no, I don't think it is suited for that.  I like the case, it fits nicely.  None of the external ports/mic/s-pen/headphone jack locations are covered so they are easily accessible.  This will work if you aren't rough on your phone, but if you tend to damage them more than most, I would look at a beefier case altogether.  Still a decent case none the less.I received this item at a discounted price to review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM8K94RG3LC9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013XLXC34#wasThisHelpful","RM8K94RG3LC9D","A2BQPAH744QAES","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BQPAH744QAES?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
