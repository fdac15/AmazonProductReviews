"This is a difficult book, in a lot of ways. The writing is positively Edwardian--some of the writing conventions used are not modern, at all; the book is really dystopian and deals in ""big ideas."" It's like this was written by Jules Verne, filtered through Kurt Vonnegut.It's about Mars, but it's also about class distinctions, and gender issues, and possibly about the end of the human race. All of the characters are adults with long, odd histories. The storylines are disjointed and very train-of-thought.Also, the writing itself is just strange: the characters talk in non-sequiturs; there is an odd amount of exposition; it takes half the book to get used to the author's writing style, which is like vignettes strung together, somewhat randomly.I'd recommend this, though--it will take a long-time to read, but it is good enough at creating the alternate-world-building that is the reason so many of us read science fiction, that I wanted to finish the book.  This is literature, worthy of being taken seriously.  It's the kind of thing I'd read on vacation--I kept picturing it as the sort of thing one would want to break up the monotony of the sort of endless beaches one finds in some parts of the tropics, when there is really time to think.

"These are great for organizing. They are also great if you're living in a house built before 1960--the closets seem to be much smaller in older houses.  I bought the six-pack of these for clothes--six of them will hold thirty pairs of underwear, forty pairs of socks, five pairs of bike shorts, ten bras, and five pairs of shorts. Basically, if you have space in a closet, with these, you can avoid having a chest of drawers. These are also better at the organization of small clothing pieces;I could never find this much, as fast, in a regular set of drawers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WPPGYQKLGQA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SXYF06#wasThisHelpful","R1WPPGYQKLGQA5","A175N19FS2B4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A175N19FS2B4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my second Tuft and Needle mattress--the first one I had slept on is on the third floor of an old house in Baltimore, actually on an old wood floor.  This is a fantastic night's sleep!If you have tendinitis, this doesn't hurt pressure points. It's very, very comfortable if you are a back sleeper.One warning: once you open the second cover, the mattress will inflate like a balloon in a matter of seconds. Don't open that last cover until you've put the bed where you want it. Recommended.Edit:  After a few days, I feel better than I have in years. (I was sleeping on a fifteen-year-old Sealy futon.)

"These are very cooling gel and mouth line patches that adhere directly to clean skin. They feel good, and they are not irritating. They appear to smooth out lines, a little, in only ten minutes.

"This is probably not a guy's sunscreen. It has an amazing smell--somewhere between honeysuckle and mountain laurel.  Being female and fond of scent, I love it, but I can't see the macho cyclists and climbers I know slathering this on before hitting the trail. I also wouldn't use it on my face, because of the scent.That said, this is an aesthetically and technologically impressive sunscreen.  When it first goes on, there is a little bit of irritation, but then it sinks in.  After five minutes, it sinks in and it's not greasy at all.  It doesn't leave white marks on upholstery or clothing.And then, it does something a little odd: if you cover your arm in it, and then run water over it, the water acts like you have put a layer of Gore-Tex on your arm.  On the front of the bottle, it says, ""sweat evaporates away.""  I don't know about evaporation, but this will make you slightly waterproof.This also contains Helioplex, which is a European sunscreen finally being sold in the U.S. It's a very effective sunscreen that actually protects against UVA and UVB. I would buy this again, because it doesn't leave white marks, and because of the wonderful scent.One caveat: my boyfriend is chemically sensitive, and this made him wheeze, so if you have trouble with a lot of chemicals or scent, this is not for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W1TMFDGQGTW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR1YLLI#wasThisHelpful","R1W1TMFDGQGTW2","A175N19FS2B4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A175N19FS2B4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a compelling and fun collection of ghost stories that even adults will enjoy.  Our protagonist is a young boy drawn to a gathering of slightly ghostly people, sitting around a table, each telling a story in turn. Each one is voiced a little differently, which makes the book interesting enough to come back to repeatedly.It's a little advanced--there is some gore. I might not give it to kids under thirteen, particularly if they're the type to get nightmares.  None of these is particularly scary, and at least one is kind of sweet.I liked this book and wanted to finish it.

"In water by itself this is a thick coconut shake. It's not gritty, and it's very, very filling.  It tastes good, and it staves off hunger. It's truly gluten free.

This is a sweetener used in traditional Chinese medicine, as a longevity aid. It tastes good!Having said that, this is a little bit of an odd product.  I'm not clear why they bothered to make it gluten-free. Many celiacs are lactose intolerant, so this product is not for them. Also, many people with gluten intolerance are lactose intolerant, so this product is not for them either. And, celiacs can have an immune system reaction to casein (think colitis), so this  product is not for lactose-tolerant celiacs who react to casein.Having said that, I'd say this is recommended if you're gluten-intolerant, but not reactive to casein or lactose intolerant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9F4IESTCUVO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQY3Q0C#wasThisHelpful","R9F4IESTCUVO9","A175N19FS2B4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A175N19FS2B4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a dust mite allergy. If you have to get an unzippered cover, this works better than some unzippered covers for dust mite allergy. This is the second mattress cover I've tried that does not cover the entire mattress, and I don't notice much of a difference between this and an unsealed mattress, but this does work better than others I have tried. (If you're trying to treat dustmite allergy, you need zippered mattress covers. My doctor also said that I needed zippered covers, but I was hoping to save the cost by trying something less expensive.)  Dustmites are everywhere, and unless you seal up your mattress, your allergies won't be helped as much.Also, this  is slippery against an older mattress. If you have an older mattress or futon that is even a little bit concave, you'll spend your night slipping into the center of the bed.  I've slept on sealed mattresses in hotels treated for bed bugs, where the cover was not as slippery.This isn't completely a loss. It has a soft terry cover, so it might work for a newer mattress, if you're just trying to use it as a waterproof bed cover. Also, it's well constructed--it just won't help much with dust mites, like the manufacturer claims.

"Set in 2010 London, this story follows several days in the life of an early twenties-Londoner with a sleep-wake disorder, a coding job, a clubbing habit, and a real fondness for trying new street drugs.  There, any similarity to the real world goes slightly, and wonderfully off-course:  the book is full of amazingly constructed sentences, infrequently-but-creatively used words like ""farrago"", and addictively inventive writing. The plotting is incredibly creative: it starts out, literally, a little like Neil Gaimain's, ""Neverwhere,"" complete with mascot animal, and then it heads into William Gibsonish cyberpunk, with elements of the slightly mononoke (Japanese spirit animal) themes that animate Hiruke Murakami's work.  It's also really, really funny, and has a lot of action, which suggests Neal Stephenson's near-future-unlikely-hero intrigues. It's also full of realistic, grimy details from Burma and everyday London, that remind me of Pat Cadigan's gritty cyberpunk noir.Plot-wise, I don't want to reveal too much, because it would spoil the book. If you like any of the modern-near-future writers, or you are or were a fan of cyberpunk, this is for you. It's remarkably creative. This is a short read, at something nearing 250 pages, but you should read it when you don't have other important things to do, because the story will compel you to keep reading.

"I have a corgi/chihuahua rescue that has some allergies. Normally I keep her on Diamond K Chicken and Rice, and she does pretty well with licking and scratching. However, I wanted to try her on another kind of food, just to keep things interesting. She loves this.  It doesn't seem to make her allergies any worse, and she eats it all up.I can't unequivocally recommend this for one reason, though: it's very high fiber and high volume for a dog food. The original Purina formula was developed with dogs kept in a lab in the basement of an office building.  The researchers were looking for a food combination that would produce low volume, compact waste, so that a dog living in an apartment would really only need to go two or three times a day.  This formula is nothing like that; it produces really high volume dog waste, even after a slow addition to regular dog food.If you can walk your dog often, your dog has a yard, or even if your dog has a dog door and a patio, this is fine.  However, if that is not the case, your dog will be waking you in the middle of the night to be let out, even in an older, well-house trained dog.  I'm sure the fiber and real food are great for dogs--I know mine loves it-- but I can only recommend this for dogs that have good access to the outdoors on a very regular basis.

"This is truly gluten free.  The Vega One website says that they ELISA test to make sure their product is less than 20ppm gluten. I'm celiac, and I didn't react, so I think it's truly gluten-free.However, this has many other issues.  This has inulin, which can be difficult to digest for people who have IBS or trouble digesting some sugars. It's also really high fiber, so it's not completely tummy friendly.This is also gritty. It has a bitter aftertaste, which is pretty normal for shakes of this type. The bitter aftertaste is really, really strong, though. In fact, it's so strong, that I've come back repeatedly to edit this review to emphasize how bitter it is.  The four stars are for the nutrition and the gluten-free-ness, not the taste. This is like oat-free soylent.  I bet you could live on it, too.It does feel and taste like real food, though;  I would recommend this for people who have celiac or gluten intolerance who can tolerate inulin, and who are finding it difficult to get gluten-free food because of traveling or living in food deserts without good grocery stores. It will stave off hunger for several hours. Mixed in with a cup of almond milk and a cup of water, it's palatable, except for the aftertaste.

"This is the story of a trip to another star.  It is written, in large part, by the ship's computer--and the language in the book is odd, probably for that reason. It's also more detailed than I would have liked, which makes it a little difficult to read.More about big ideas than about moments and little details, an intricately plotted story follows a group of people in a multiple wheel ship to Tau Ceti, following the political and biological problems they have along the way. A lot of the science is really good--when you are missing certain elements, your ecosystems start to have issues. Overall, though, this is a little different and charmingly light.It's not space opera, so much as space serial; it has some odd plot holes; a large portion of the settlers are sequestered, in a sense, and then never mentioned again. More Niven than Reynolds, less Degrasse-Tyson than Chomsky, the book spends a lot of time parsing language, and not as much showing how neat such a voyage might be.

"This is rough.  It's also a fun ride.  Set in an alternate future in which Texas, as well as Arizona and New Mexico are natural deserts, the book is an intricate, interlocking puzzle of sandstorms, refugees, water rights, and huge interior water reclamation plants, complete with apartments, greywater recycling and glittering technologies.  (Even the trash disposals recycle methane.)The story follows a Phoenix journalist, a morally ambiguous, but not-entirely-morally-bankrupt ""water knife"" who is basically a fixer towards anyone who gets in the way of water rights, and a girl from Texas.  There is a lot of bloodshed, gore, torture, prostitution, and exploitation.  The bad guys don't always win, however, so this is something to keep reading through the difficult parts. It's a satisfying story.This is also very cleverly written: it plays with a lot of ideas based in current events.  Refugees from Texas are called, ""Merry Perry's"".  Canadians and Chinese are the economic victors; there are references to ""desert cough"", which is a real, current, medical problem caused by airborne fungus in areas struck by drought.One caveat:  if you have ever spent any time in Texas, there are some things about this book that don't sit right. Texas has been farmed since the 1600's, by Spanish settlers that built the Missions in the central and border areas of the state that have aquifers restored by native rain, not the Colorado River, which the book is about. The author seems to think that most of the state is naturally desert, instead of prairie (technically Texas is part of the Great Plains); Austin has more in common with the cattle-ranching-oil-industry city of Calgary in Canada, than it does with Phoenix, the city to which Austin is compared. However, in the author's defense, making Texas into a natural desert may have been a conceit to get the rest of the book to hang together.Also, like some of this other author's works, I can't recommend it to people who have issues with sexual exploitation.Overall, though, this is an entertaining, wild ride. The writing is well worth the price of admission.  With some reservations, recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UBMJZ79U486Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352875#wasThisHelpful","R2UBMJZ79U486Z","A175N19FS2B4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A175N19FS2B4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is a lot to like in this book.  Some of the stories will remind you of many traditional military science fiction stories, in which our heroes in uniform stumble upon something really not quite o.k.  However, the vast majority of the writing is very original and engaging.  There are plot lines here you definitely haven't seen before.  At least one is a fantasy story set in a science-fiction universe--and surprisingly, it has the most emotional impact.Neal Asher's particular contribution has the kind of amazing world building that makes you hope he writes a novel around the story included here.

"These are life saving if you are a celiac with fructose intolerance. It says these are certified gluten-free--believe it. This is good food, and these can correct vitamin imbalances that go with celiac. If you eat these for a week, you'll feel better, I promise. These also don't have FODMAPs (other things that are dificult to digest.) They won't make you sick, and they don't cause any digestive issues at all. This is real, safe food.Having celiac isn't easy--you get busy, and you get poor from buying expensive gluten-free food, and suddenly you're getting sick again. These can be the stopgap food that keeps that from ever happening, because they are tasty and cheap.Also, there is enough protein and fat in these that two will make a meal replacement.

"Seriously, I spent my Friday night complaining at and to my very patient computer programmer (PhD, thank you), trying to get this darn thing to work.  When we reset my MediaLink router--which is the first step in the instructions for the TP-Link Wireless Range Extender--the ""range extender"" broke some of the internal programming in my original router and we had to to a hard reboot of the Medialink router (with a paperclip).Don't expect to use this unless you're willing to spend several hours with a very patient IT professional fixing your original router, and you can be without your original router for that long.  By the time we got the router running again, the  TP-Link range extender didn't connect anyway, and we couldn't get the range extender to connect so that it would work.  The only thing the ""range extender"" did was cross wires with my original Medialink router, making it so that I had several hours with no internet connection at all.Once we re-established the internet connection, even with a functioning, reset Medialink router, the TP-Link would not connect.  It might work with another kind of router, but it won't work with a Medialink.So ultimately, we threw this in the trash.(Nope, I've just been advised not to throw it in the trash, because it might have stolen data. We're going to take it apart for scavengeable electronic parts. It may be repurposed as a synthesizer, or something that doesn't require a wireless broadcast.

"I have a corgi/chihuahua rescue who is the miracle dog--she survived three days in the snow with a prior owner; she was heartworm positive, and is now heartworm negative, two years later. She has survived a lot, but I'm a little afraid of putting medicine on her that I'm not familiar with--she has sensitive skin, too. She has to have special shampoo (Crazy Dog for Puppies) and specific protein food (Diamond Chicken and Rice), because of allergies.Usually, I use Frontline, but I live in a very heavily populated area of the South that has tons of small dogs and feral cats, so the fleas here are somewhat Frontline tolerant.  I put this on the chigi's neck earlier today.  She stopped scratching, which usually means the fleas are going away.I was impressed by the formulation--my chigi has the corgi double coat, that is oily, and sometimes Frontline starts to roll right over the outer oily layer of fur.

"We had a skunk-based incident that left our previous coop unusable AND meant we needed a new coop before nightfall. The local farm supply store had this coop, and only this coop, in stock, so it was what we got.1) Assembly: pretty easy. Doable with one person, but you'll be a lot happier with two.2) Basic functionality: the doors latch, which is good, but if you're going with this product be sure to buy some hardware cloth to go underneath. Rats and other vermin can tunnel in easily otherwise.3) Capacity: We currently have six hens in here at night, and they range during the day. I'd be hesitant to put even two hens in here full-time. The footprint is small, there's no room for them to stretch their legs.4) Facilities: There is no roosting bar, you hens will have to sleep on the floor. This isn't a crisis, but chickens are happier roosting. The pull-out tray for changing litter is basically useless unless you have so little litter in there that the litter will be useless. Probably works better for rabbits than chickens, which is what i think this was designed for. Sticking a food and water dish inside is nearly impossible, so if you animals aren't ranging during the day, you'll have to be creative.5) Long-term functionality: Less than two months in, and both door latches are rusting badly. The product is not well-made from quality materials. Before shelling out cash for this, realize what you're getting: a cheap but functional product. It's low-end Ikea for your chickens.

The cover is a generic beige, but the cover edges and the coil are a nice burnt orange that works surprisingly well as an accent.The only change i'd make to this is using a slightly thicker paper.

"I didn't much like this book, but i was sufficiently engaged in the core mystery to finish it. That's why it gets more than one star.For starters, the basic premise is flawed. The main character is The Last Robot In The World, which should make him the WORST private investigator/assassin ever, not the best.Second, the writing is an awkward halfway between old fashioned hardboiled noir and standard mystery/thriller. At times it's horribly over-written for the latter, and at times it's horribly streamlined for the former.Third, the book feels compelled, every few pages, to remind us rather bluntly that the PI we're following around is a robot, with robot characteristics and abilities, and also a robot, in case we forgot.And last... well, it just doesn't make sense. At the end you'll get a nice wrap-up, a who/what/where/when/why, but it just doesn't work. We know why the robot PI was hired in the first place but...well, i repeat myself: it doesn't make sense.Granted, this is apparently the first in the 'LA Trilogy', so maybe the heavy foreshadowing laid in this book is for future books and not this one, and perhaps the totally nonsensical explanation for the events in this volume is part of that meta-narrative, but... well... it didn't make sense.

The heroes, the villains, even the random extras in any Pratchett book (or Princess Bride) were delightful characters. Certainly not always people you'd like to sit next to on a cross-country flight, or even know they live in the same town as you, but always, in their way, delightful.This book?

I'm wondering about their neighbors, their cousins in another state/district, the ones who are trying to just live their lives when superheroes are destroying things, wizards are at war, or some other kid is picked for the Hunger Games. The Special Snowflakes of YA books just seem even more ridiculous than they did before.In a way, i'm hoping Ness writes a 'sequel' to this one, where he actually writes the YA ordinary-girl-saves-the-world-and-falls-in-love-in-the-span-of-a-week-or-so that happens in the background (well, technically, the chapter openings) of this, just because it seemed like it would also be a send-up of the genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VIWEQMLSVCA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062403168#wasThisHelpful","R1VIWEQMLSVCA3","A3JHC8O59WDHFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JHC8O59WDHFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In fact, even while being actively shot at, he takes time to admire her backside and the fit of her pants.

"As a physician it is pretty much mandatory not to wear latex gloves anymore due to the fairly high number of people with latex allergies.  Unlike other nitrile gloves I have used that have powder in them, these Ammex gloves are nice because they are easy to put on and take off without a powder residue.  They feel a little thin, but seem durable enough to provide adequate protection for performing non-sterile medical duties.  These are ideal for wearing while handling body fluids, drawing blood, performing rectal or pelvic exams, etc.  They would also be suitable for many non-medical purposes, too, as long as tough durability is not needed.  For example, these are useful to wear at home while working on the innards of my computer or protecting my hands while using solvents to clean my firearms.  I wear an Extra Large glove size, and these X-Large gloves fit perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAIMGQU2OFZBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006C3QCHY#wasThisHelpful","RAIMGQU2OFZBZ","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use nitrile gloves to protect my hands from solvents while cleaning firearms.  These Ammex gloves are comparable to other (blue) nitrile gloves I have used in the past.  Unlike the others I have used, though, these gloves seem to slip onto my hands a lot easier despite the lack of powder.  I also like the fact that there is not powder all over my hands after wearing them.  They seem to be very durable, stretch well without tearing easily, and work well for my stated purpose.  These would be good gloves for most non-medical situations where one might want protection from solvents or other contaminants or to keep oils and moisture of the hands from contaminating work surfaces.  I usually wear an Extra Large glove, and these X-Large gloves fit perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SRQ6JXCMX4KD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E21HDK#wasThisHelpful","R1SRQ6JXCMX4KD","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second Philips Sonicare Flexcare Platinum toothbrush I have owned.  The first one lasted a little over 2 years, which was an enormous disappointment.  Compared with other Sonicare toothbrushes, the Flexcare Platinum can be highly customized for intensity and also for duration of cleaning.  It does a very good job of cleaning my teeth, and I especially like that it will remember the last setting so I don't have to keep readjusting it for a deeper clean.  The brush is designed to tell you if you are brushing too hard, which helps to protect your teeth.  The brush will keep a charge for 2 weeks, meaning you don't need to take the charger if you are travelling for a shorter period of time.  The travel case is firm plastic and keeps both the handle and brush head well-protected.There are some things to dislike about this product.  The button to change brushing intensity is long and centered in the handle.  It is way too easy to accidentally change the intensity of brushing while holding the handle during brushing.  The handle is quite slender and, in my large hands anyway, is a little awkward to hold compared with other Sonicare models that have a rounder handle.  Unlike other Sonicare models, there are no indicator lights to show you the brush is charging while on the charger.  This was quite disturbing at first, and I wondered if I received a defective product, but the handle charged up with no problems.  The charging base has a post to store a second brush head, but at this price point the base should have a UV brush head sterilizer built in.Sonicare makes some excellent rechargeable toothbrushes.  The Flexcare platinum is at the higher end of their product line, but quite honestly you can buy another Flexcare model that will work equally well for less money.  If you look at the other Flexcare models on Amazon you will find you can buy a set of two Flexcare handles with brushes, a charger with UV sterilizer, a travel charger, and two travel cases for about the same amount or less than you will spend on this Flexcare Platinum model (see Philips Sonicare Flexcare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush Premium Edition 2 pack bundle (2 Flexcare Handles, 2 Diamond Clean Standard Brush Heads, 1 Compact Travel Charger, 2 Hygienic Travel Caps, 2 Hard Travel Cases, 1 UV Sanitizer)).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EKAVCJOPCOBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR7YP8#wasThisHelpful","R1EKAVCJOPCOBQ","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had the opportunity to use and review Axe White Label Body Wash, Night 16 oz  recently and so loved the body wash and the scent that I quickly bought more.  So I was very excited to try Axe White Label Shampoo & Conditioner, Night scent, which I thought would be a great match for the body wash.  Boy, was I wrong.  This product smells nothing like the body wash with the same name.  In fact, I had to check the product label to make sure they sent me the correct one.  The label was correct.  The product sent to me was lime green in color (unlike the dark purple color of the body wash) and smells just like Vick's Vapo Rub while applying it to my hair.  It even has a similar menthol feel while washing with it.  Thankfully, the scent goes away readily while rinsing my hair.  Does it shampoo well?  Yes.  The conditioner is mild and leaves my hair feeling soft.  But the smell.  Epic fail.  Axe:  if you are reading this review, please change the scent to match the body wash.  This one is a loser.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3COOU7HL4ODQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q70QKBK#wasThisHelpful","R3COOU7HL4ODQL","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have purchased several Anne Klein watches for my wife over the years, and she has always loved them.  They have always kept good time.  So I knew she would be excited to own this one, too.  Like all Anne Klein watches, this set comes packaged in a very attractive gift box with good padding inside.  The watch was already set to the correct time when I received it, so there was nothing for her to do other than unclasp it and put it on to wear.  It has a Japanese quartz movement in it, which in my experience has typically been very good at keeping accurate time.  The photos of this product really do not do it justice.  The detail, colors, and Swarovski crystals make the watch look absolutely beautiful when seen in person.  The bracelets are equally attractive and match well with the watch.  The clasps on the watch and bracelets all fasten securely, and my wife had no difficulty opening and closing them.  She happily wore the watch and bracelets to work today, but they would also look very attractive for formal wear.  You cannot beat Anne Klein's lifetime warranty, either.  I have used their warranty service in the past when my wife accidentally broke a ceramic watch bracelet, and they sent the needed parts with no questions asked other than what model her watch was.  Their customer service is excellent.This is a very pretty watch & bracelet set with a lifetime warranty that would be perfect for a woman to wear for both casual and formal occasions and would also make an excellent gift.  Considering the quality of the watch and jewelry you are getting, Amazon's current selling price of $150 is very reasonable and a good value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J6CWU9JZQKCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QVWZW4A#wasThisHelpful","R2J6CWU9JZQKCH","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this garage door opener remote after discovering that the Linkmaster remote given to me by a relative would not work with a Genie garage door opener.  I ride a motorcycle and wanted a remote that would be small enough to fit in my pocket.  This remote is no larger than a small matchbox and is perfect for my intended usage.  It took longer to remove the two screws in my garage door opener housing to access the learning button than it did to program this remote which literally took only a few seconds.  There is one large button and two smaller buttons that can each be configured to work with the same or different openers.  Unfortunately, only the large button on the remote would pair with my garage door opener. The two smaller buttons did not work. It appears other reviewers have reported this same problem, so there may be an issue with quality control in manufacture.  That is the only reason I docked this item 2 stars in my review. There is an included keychain with a plastic quick disconnect feature to it.  Those wanting a remote to attach to a car visor will not be happy with this product as it is not designed for that purpose and does not have a visor clip.If you have a Genie garage door opener with Intellicode (ours is over 15 years old) and want a small remote control for it that you can attach to a keychain and/or carry in your pocket this model should be ideal if you can get one that works properly.Update 8/21/15I received a very prompt replacement remote from the seller.The product information sheet that comes with the remote tells you how to change the battery in the remote but not how to program it.  For the Genie Intellicode garage door openers you must open the front housing of the garage door opener (where the lights are -- you may need to unscrew screws to do this).  On the front of the garage door opener panel (which will likely be on the same side where the wire antenna is located) you will see a small button next to an LED light.  You press the button to activate the opener's learning function, and the LED will turn on.  You then point the remote at the opener from at least 2 feet away and press the button on the remote that you want to program for that opener.  This must be done within about 30 seconds or you will have to start all over again.  Do not press and hold the button on the remote or it may not work.  For Genie openers with Intellicode you held down the desired button for only a couple of seconds, release the button, and then press for another couple of seconds, release, and press at third time after which the garage door should open.  The other thing I discovered is you can only program one button for any given garage door opener.  So if you only have two doors, you will only be able to get two buttons to work.  I think this may be by design and not a defect in the opener.  You should also know that Genie openers with Intellicode can only learn and retain a limited number of remote codes.  So if you exceed that limit one of your other remotes may no longer work after programming a new one.  So, in summary, I have been able to pair both of my garage door openers with this remote.  I cannot use the third button but don't need it to open both of my garage doors with the other buttons.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25Y0DVG2HKUR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CSWZ6M#wasThisHelpful","R25Y0DVG2HKUR8","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own many Invicta watches and have always been curious about Swiss Legend watches as they appear to have similar styling.  So I was happy to get the opportunity to review this watch.Like most watches, this watch arrives in an attractive presentation box that is well-padded for protection.  A small instruction booklet is included that provides instructions not only for this particular watch but also other Swiss Legend watches with different features.  Other manufacturers do this, too, and I find it somewhat difficult to sort out which instructions pertain to the watch I have.  That aside, they do contain the information needed to properly use this watch.The first thing to notice about this watch is it is absolutely beautiful.  It looks much more handsome than the photo implies.  The blue hue in photo is much more subtle on the actual watch itself, making the watch appear much more elegant than the photo suggests.  There is a lot of plastic wrap to remove from the metal band, watch face, and back of the watch.  The watch is large but not overly so and is comparable to the size of many Invicta watches for those familiar with the brand.  Counter to another reviewer's opinion, I do not think this watch is too large for the wrist of most men.  It is hefty, which in my experience is usually found in watches of higher quality construction.When I first looked at the watch I thought it wasn't running because the long second hand was not moving.  What I discovered, though, is the long second hand is used for the stop watch function, and the continuous second hand is actually located on the upper right small dial.  The other thing to know about this watch is it has a screw down crown.  This means you need to unscrew the crown by rotating it counterclockwise until it pops outward before you can adjust the time, day, and date settings.  After doing so you need to be sure to screw the crown back down for the watch to remain water resistant.  Having both day and date features is something you do not often see in watches in this price range, and it is handy being able to keep track of the day of the week. The stop watch function is operated by the two buttons at the 2:00 and 4:00 locations on the watch case.  I had a little trouble figuring out the purpose of the knurled knob on the upper left edge of the watch case but quickly discovered it adjusts the inner ring that lists the names of other countries so you can set it for the time of the country you are in and see what time it is in other countries at a glance.  The print is far too tiny to be of any use to me, but for world travelers with sharper vision than mine it may be a useful feature.  The date window is quite small, and a small magnifier would have been nice to read it more easily. So far, given the short time period I have owned the watch, it appears to keep accurate time.The stainless steel band appears to be well-constructed for a watch in this price range, and it is large enough to fit a pretty large wrist.  Like other watches, the band has removable links that allow you to adjust the band for proper fit.  I have an average sized wrist for most men and had to remove two links for it to fit my wrist well, which I had no difficulty doing with a standard watch link removal tool (available from Amazon and a very handy and inexpensive tool to have for anyone who collects watches).  The clasp on the band is a ""hidden"" clasp that folds inward from both ends and secures in the center making the band look like a continuous bracelet.  The clasp seems secure and is easily opened by pressing inward on the small wings that stick out on the edges of the clasp.Overall, I am very impressive with this Swiss Legend watch.  It is very stylish and attractive in appearance, and it seems to be of good construction.  It is large enough to get noticed on a man's wrist but not so large to look out of place.  The ""list price"" of $995.00 is absurd, but Amazon's much lower current selling price of about $156 is a very reasonable price for a watch of this quality.  It compares very favorably with Invicta watches selling in this same price range.  This watch is well worth consideration for any man wanting a stylish watch with these features in this price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20MDOXTSHK058/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJIR3HM#wasThisHelpful","R20MDOXTSHK058","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being someone who absolutely hates to use floss, and seeing that the Philips Sonicare Airfloss Pro is intended specifically for people like me, I was particularly anxious to try this product.The product sent to me for review arrived in a rather plain-looking cardboard box.  There was almost no product identification printed on the box.  The product itself arrives nestled inside with good protection from damage.  Included is a charging base, a single floss nozzle, and a small 2 oz. bottle of Philips BreathRx mouthwash.  Additional nozzles and mouthwash can be purchased separately (a pair of nozzles list for $8.99; 16 oz. of Philips BreathRx mouthwash is $14.99).  The included product manual states the AirFloss unit can be used with either water or mouthwash and, after initial charging for 24 hours, will operate for up to 2 weeks without needing to be recharged.  The charging base appears to be the same one Philips uses for their current line of FlexCare electric toothbrushes.After charging the AirFloss unit for a full 24 hours I filled it with my usual Scope mouthwash.  The hatch for filling opens and closes easily, and I had no trouble pouring mouthwash into the reservoir, although it fills rather quickly, and I spilled a small amount of mouthwash in the process.  Using a smaller mouthwash bottle would probably make this process easier.  The nozzle clicks into place on the top of the handle.  The opening of the nozzle should be positioned facing away from the button on the top of the handle.  There is a small button on the bottom of the handle that turns the unit on.  Several small lights with turn on to indicate the unit is on.  Once you do this the AirFloss is ready to operate.I flossed my teeth earlier the same day so I could give the AirFloss Pro a fair chance of working optimally.  After brushing my teeth I gave it a try. Starting at the center of my mouth I positioned he tip of the nozzle between my teeth at the base of my gum and pressed the top button on the unit.  As advertised, a burst of 3 quick shots of liquid was fired from the nozzle (this can be configured with the power button to use 1, 2, or 3 bursts -- the default is 3).  The liquid comes out forcefully enough that I could feel it go between my teeth and exit behind them.  I then simply moved the nozzle tip slightly to fit between the next two teeth and pressed the button again.  It did not take longer than about a minute to use it between all of my teeth, and the amount of liquid that accumulated in my mouth was maybe half the amount I would normally use to rinse and gargle with.  I rinsed my mouth with it and spit it out.  My mouth felt clean, although I can't say it felt any cleaner than it normally would after brushing and rinsing/gargling with mouthwash, which I did after finishing brushing and flossing with the AirFloss Pro.  I had no difficulty keeping the liquid bursts in my mouth during usage.  You can turn the AirFloss Pro off by pressing the power button on the bottom of the handle, or it will turn itself off if you put it on the charger.The AirFloss Pro claims to lead to healthier gums within 2 weeks of regular usage.  Time constraints for writing reviews prevents me from waiting that long to see what happens, but I can say the product is easy to use, takes very little time or effort to use, and is something I can easily incorporate into my usual twice daily dental routine.  I definitely prefer to use something like the AirFloss Pro rather than flossing with string, so if it will make my gums healthier without having to use string floss I will be very pleased over time.  The price for the AirFloss Pro is about what you would pay for a quality electric toothbrush.  I do think Philips should include a plastic travel case for it at this price point, like they do with their Sonicare toothbrushes,, but this is a relatively minor quibble.  It would also be nice if a second nozzle was provided and a stand built into the charging base to store nozzles on it so it would be easier for others to share the AirFloss Pro.  Overall, I think it is a great product for flossing without string, and it would be ideal for those who hate to use string to floss (like me) or who can't use string floss due to wearing dental appliances or for other reasons.  I really like the AirFloss Pro and will be using it regularly from now on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QC0DR25PENKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ67KBK#wasThisHelpful","R1QC0DR25PENKV","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use binoculars mainly for usage while target shooting and occasional bird watching.  Up to now I have been using Minox Bv 10x42 binoculars, so I was curious to see how the Bushnell Legend Ultra HD L-series binoculars, which are priced similarly to the Minox, stack up.These Bushnell binoculars arrive nicely packaged in plastic with two covers, a soft bag cover and a firm fabric cover.  Included are rubber lens protectors for both the eye cups and the objective lenses.  The covers for the eye cups are removed completely for usage of the binoculars, although they do have a ring to attach them to the included neck strap to keep them from getting lost.  The covers for the objective lenses are flip-down covers that stay attached to the binoculars with a rubber ring.  They are designed so they can be easily removed and replaced if needed.Like most quality binoculars these Bushnell Legend ones have easy twist adjustable eye cups for eye relief and also a locking diopter adjustment (on the right eye cup only).  They right eye cup diopter adjustment is made with a movable ring that can be locked in place.  To unlock the diopter ring for adjustment you pull it upward (it only moves about 1 mm, so the movement is slight), turn the ring to the desired diopter setting, and then push the ring back down to lock the setting in place.  There is a knurled knob on the ring, I presume to make it easier to adjust, although I found the ring was easier to lock/unlock and adjust without using the knob.  If I were Bushnell I would get rid of the knob as it really doesn't improve function and prevents the right rubber eyecup cover from seating all the way down on the eyecup.  This is a minor quibble, though, and does not detract from the overall quality or performance of these binoculars.Compared with my Minox binoculars the Bushnell binoculars are noticeably heavier but about the same size.  They have a very solid feel with good construction.  The quality of view is equivalent to my Minox BV binoculars, and these Bushnell binoculars provide a very sharp image.  I had no difficulty focusing at both great distance and close up (within about 4 feet).  About the only downside is there is no mount to attach the binoculars to a tripod, but my Minox binoculars do not have this feature either.Overall, these Bushnell Legend Ultra HD L-Series 10x42 binoculars are very nice binoculars for their price.  They compare favorably with Minox BV 10x42 binoculars in size, features, and performance.  Being somewhat heavy and having no tripod mount they would not be the best choice for star gazing.  They would be ideal, though, for anyone wanting good quality binoculars for hunting, sporting events, bird watching, and target shooting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14Q72Z1P9ZF97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9N2M0K#wasThisHelpful","R14Q72Z1P9ZF97","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To maximize and optimize the flavor of wine it needs to be aerated.  One way to do this is to open a bottle of wine and let it sit for an hour or two to aerate.  Another method, often used by wine enthusiasts, is to decant the wine into a special wide-based decanter that allows for air to contact s larger surface of wine for aeration.  Even with this method the wine needs to sit for a while to let aeration bring out its maximum flavor.This Tanors wine decanter aerator arrives nicely packaged for gifting.  It aerates wine quickly while pouring by exposing wine to air more directly and quickly as it is poured into the device.  There is a removable plastic upside down umbrella that has numerous small holes in it that works as an aerator as wine is poured through it.  The aerator introduces air into the wine and brings out its optimum flavor without having to let the wine sit for an hour or more.  I found this aerator system works better than an older Venturi aerator that I had been using up to now.  There is no question wine tastes better if poured through this aerator into a glass, but it tastes even better if allowed to sit for a half hour or so to aerate further. A small plastic stand is included to store the aerator upright between uses.If you enjoy drinking wine and prefer not to wait for an hour or longer to get the optimum flavor this aerator will help optimize its flavor quicker.  It is easy to use, works well, and is easy to clean and store between uses.  It is inexpensive and would make a nice gift for anyone who enjoys drinking wine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13NQEEYBBDE4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ORZHJZI#wasThisHelpful","R13NQEEYBBDE4U","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have five adult cats ranging in age from about 3-1/2 years old to 12 years old.  They typically like to eat fish, chicken, and beef cat food in various preparations.  I took this Nutro Company Adult Cat Chunky Loaf food and put it out with other canned cat food that our cats usually love to eat to see what would happen.  Our cats devoured the Nutro cat food like it was a rare treat.  The other food I sat out for them went largely untouched.  So based upon our cats' apparent preference I would say this Nutro food is very much preferred (by my cats, at least).  It is not cheap, but it is comparably priced to other premium cat food.

"I have well over $15,000 invested in my home audio system.  For a long time I have looked for a set of headphones that can provide the audiophile sound I expect from the rest of my system.  I think I have found them in these Philips X2/27 Fidelio Premium Headphones.The headphones arrive attractively packaged in a black box.  They come with a detachable cable with standard 1/8"" stereo plugs on both ends and a gold-plated adapter for use with conventional amplifiers and receivers that use a 1/4"" plug.  The cable is too long for listening with a portable mp3 player and too short for listening with a home audio system from across the room.  I will be looking for a suitable extension cable to use with it since I plan to use these headphones solely for listening with my home audio system.  Sadly, there is no bag or carry case included, which I think is a major oversight for headphones this expensive but not a deal-breaker.The headphones are quite large, but very comfortable to wear.  The head band is designed with comfort in mind, and the velour ear cups are very soft on my ears even with prolonged listening.  I have been listening to a wide variety of music with them, music with deep bass, music with predominant midrange sound, and music with delicate high notes.  These Fidelio headphones reproduce all of it with ease with no noise or artifact.  Unlike other high-end headphones I own, there was no break-in period to hear music the way it was meant to be heard.  There is no muddling of sound at all.  Listening to music with these headphones I am hearing things that have for years gone unnoticed while listening with high-end tower speakers.  It's like having all new recordings to explore.If you love music and have the ear to appreciate quality sound reproduction you will find these Philips X2/27 Fidelio Premium Headphones to be well worth the expense.

"We have 5 cats ranging in age from 3-1/2 years old to 12 years old.  All but one usually likes cat treats.  I gave all five these Wellness Kitties treats to try.  Three cats ate them readily.  The other two pretty much ignored them.  One of the two that ignored them was the one who normally doesn't like treats anyway, so I consider this a 75% thumbs up in our household.  Compared with Whiskas Temptations, which our cats absolutely love, these treats are expensive and were not eaten as readily.  So before buying a bunch of these expensive treats you may want to have your cat try a few to see if they even like them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R357SGK6CQFY90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IP05CRS#wasThisHelpful","R357SGK6CQFY90","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third time I have purchased this exact model of clock.  I keep buying them because I really like the ceiling display which makes it very easy to tell the time while laying in bed at night, but the digits of the ceiling display just do not hold up well over time.  I think the longest one of these has lasted is about 3 years or so.  The clock is easy to set and maintains time well by setting itself by synchronizing with an atomic time clock.  The ceiling display can be turned on or off. The front LCD display is easy to illuminate by tapping the bar on the top of the clock.  It is operated on AC (adapter included) and also has a battery backup that can also power the clock in the absence of AC power.  The overall design of this clock is kind of goofy and looks like something that would have fit in better in the 1960's.If you want an alarm clock that can display time on the ceiling this Oregon Scientific clock is worth considering.  But plan on replacing it every few years as the ceiling display does not hold up very well over time.  The LCD display seems to hold up better, though, and the clock can still be used without the ceiling display.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZUHT7ZS9CCLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002H4I2C#wasThisHelpful","RZUHT7ZS9CCLQ","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this tool set on sale during Amazon Prime day.  It is smaller than I thought it would be, but it does have some useful bits for working on smaller items.  The bit sizes are about what you would see on a jeweler's screwdriver, although this is clearly a much larger assortment of bits.  Quite honestly, though, the construction of this set feels very cheap and does not look like it will hold up very well over time.  It looks and feels like a tool set that one might find in a discount bin somewhere for $2 and not the $11 I paid for it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHTNEZKHB2W6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009MKGRQA#wasThisHelpful","RHTNEZKHB2W6N","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Yes, they are made in China, but compared with other similar hangers I considered on Amazon these are truly the best value for the money spent.

"I have never used Axe branded products before but have always been curious about them.  This Axe White Label body wash has a very strong but masculine smell.  Actually, I really like the scent a lot.  So does my wife.  The soap is purple, which I could tell even before using it as some leaked out during shipping (disappointing, Amazon -- something like this really should be wrapped in a plastic bag prior to shipping).  The soap lathers well and rinses off nicely.  It does not make my skin feel overly dry.  Definitely a product I would recommend for any man.  The scent is quite strong and lingers, though, so if you can you will want to smell it before purchase to make sure it is a scent you like.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HE60VJ4HMUAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATK1HI#wasThisHelpful","R1HE60VJ4HMUAE","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These tags are perfect for what I needed them for.  I have a large collection of firearms in a safe.  Each one is stored in a fabric bag to prevent rust.  These tags enable me to label each bag with the firearm brand, model, caliber, and even the serial number with room to spare.  The wires attached to each tag are long and thin enough to easily run through the fabric of the bag without having to punch any holes.  Using these I can easily identify each firearm in my safe without having to remove it from the bag.These tags will also be perfect for attaching prices to items for our next garage sale.  Retailers would find these very useful to mark prices on items for sale.The tags are advertised as ""shipping tags.""  While they are definitely handy for attaching identification to items, the cardboard tags are very thin and would not likely hold up well if attached to items for shipping.  The hole in each tag is reinforced, but I think the paper tag itself would rip right off around it pretty easily.  So for that purpose I can't say I would recommend them.  But for price tagging or identification of items that won't undergo rough handling these are great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39DGCU6PLTYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00485FCG0#wasThisHelpful","R39DGCU6PLTYQ","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was first introduced to Philips earphones with their Philips NC1/27 Fidelio Noise Cancelling Premium Headphones with Ergonomic Memory Foam Cushions, Black, which I absolutely love.  I do listen to music and watch movies on my iPad while riding an exercise bike, so I thought these ActionFit Earbuds would be worth a try.The earbuds arrive in a nicely packaged box that is easy to open and reseal.  The earbuds are fully assembled and come with three different sizes of ear tips for a more custom fit.  The band is designed to be worn behind your head, and hooks go over each ear to keep the earbuds secured in your ears.  The cord is sturdy, seems tangle-free, and has a handy clip to secure it to your clothing if desired.  A lightweight mesh bag is included to store the earphones when not in use.I found the earbuds very comfortable to wear, and the design of the band keeps them in my ear no matter how much I move my head.  There is no adjustment to the positioning of the ear tips, though, and I found I could not get a good seal in my ear no matter which size tip I tried.  The end result was no sound isolation and very little bass response, although midrange and treble were good.  The cord is very well-insulated, and there was no noise artifact when it brushed against my clothing with movement.Pros:solid constructionband keeps them secured in your ears wellcord is well-insulated with no artifactmultiple sizes of ear tips providedwaterproof and sweatproof designCons:lack of adjustment in earbud tip may prevent sound isolation for some peoplepoor bass reproduction (could be due to lack of good seal in my ear)somewhat bulky (can't be folded up for compact storage)In summary, these are comfortable earbuds that are clearly designed for wear while exercising.  They are well-constructed and fit very securely no matter how much you might move around.  While they do have different sizes of ear tips included to help customize their fit these earbuds have no swivel at the tip which may prevent a good seal in your ear and, as a result, may compromise sound isolation and bass response for some people.  If you want sturdy earphones that will stay in place during running or other exercise these may be a good choice if they fit your ears well.  If sound quality is more important to you then you will definitely want to try these out before purchase.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGA7MPLQTT6KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V0JYQ50#wasThisHelpful","RGA7MPLQTT6KQ","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used a wide variety of wireless routers from DLink, Mediabridge, and TP Link up to now.  For years I have wanted to try Linksys to see if their routers are worth the extra money.Unlike the other routers I have used up to now, the new Linksys AC2600 4x4 MU-MIMO dual-band wireless router uses technology that sends data to multiple devices simultaneously.  By doing so this technology is supposed to speed up data transmission and prevent delays and buffering while downloading large amounts of data while streaming movies, etc.  I will say after installing and configuring this router it does seem to speed things up.The router arrives in a large cardboard box and is protected on all sides by large cardboard boxes.  The size of this router is huge.  It is about 1-1/2 times the size of my previous routers and over twice the size of my cable modem.  The only assembly involves screwing on its 4 antennae.  The included AC adapter is large and heavy.  The router has a power on/off switch that is nice compared with some of my other routers that require you to unplug the power cord to turn them off.  The user manual is in digital format written in numerous languages on an included CD.  Quite honestly, I found the manual to be largely useless compared with other routers I've owned.  This is disappointing, and for the amount of money spent I think more comprehensive and detailed manual should be provided.There is a quick install card provided that provides very skeletal information but enough to get you connected initially.  The setup for this router is not as user-friendly as it is on other brands I've used, but if you are reasonably computer literate it is pretty easy to set up.  Once you have connected the router (in Windows - I do not have a Mac on my network) you have to go to your network settings to add it to your network.  Linksys provides a temporary name and password for the router which you can change later.  Once your computer has recognized the router, and you have logged on to it with your password, you then open a web browser and log in to linksyssmartwifi.com to finish configuring and setting up the router.  You can allow the router to do this all automatically for you (the preferred method) or, if you want to do so manually you can do so.  The automatic set up was quite fast and easy, and I had no trouble reassigning a new name and password for the newly connected router.  You can also sign up for a Linksys Smart Wi-Fi account that enables you to log on from anywhere and make adjustments to your router settings.  The ability to access and change router settings remotely is handy and a feature not available on other routers I have used.Unlike most of my old routers, the AC2600 provides 2.4 and 5 gHz access along with guest access for each of those frequencies as well.  You can assign different passwords for each or keep them all the same if desired.  The router also has USB connections for adding a USB printer or hard drive to share on the network.  This is especially handy for attaching newer 1 terabyte or larger USB hard drives for easy backup among multiple computers on the network.Once your router is completely configured it is easy to access the settings using a web browser to make changes.  There is also a built-in speedometer that can show you how quickly data is downloaded and uploaded.  Range transmission is excellent.  I have excellent signal strength showing throughout my home.Overall, I am very pleased with the Linksys AC2600 router.  It does seem to speed up transmission between computers connected to my home network, and I have had not delays or issues streaming music, movies, or TV shows with the Amazon Fire box connected to my home audio-video system.  It does add an extra guest account in the 5 gHz range that my TP Link router lacked.  The firewall security is excellent.  This Linksys AC2600 router has a premium price tag attached to it, but it is comparable in price to other brands of routers offering similar features and performance.  If you have a lot of wireless devices in your network using a shared Wi-Fi connection, especially if 3 or more are operated simultaneously, it may be well worth the added expense to prevent delays in data transmission.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDYYR9V1QIH9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN21DK#wasThisHelpful","RDYYR9V1QIH9T","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For many years I have appreciated audiophile sound and have owned very high-end audio equipment to enjoy music at home.  My hearing is good enough to detect subtle sound differences from both speakers and headphones.  Over the years I have listened to music through a wide range of headphones from those that are inexpensive to those costing several hundred dollars, and I can hear the difference between all of them.  Now that I have started streaming music on my iPad and iPhone for less formal listening I have been looking for some nice headphones for that purpose.The Skullcandy Grind headphones arrive in a cardboard box that opens much like a cereal box.  You have to rip off a tab on the bottom flap of the box to open it, which kind of cheapens the presentation of the product.  Inside is a folded, rigid plastic tray that contains the headphones.  In a small plastic bag is a straight cord to plug into the headphones and two pieces of paper folded up very tightly, a warranty description and a sheet of very brief instructions printed in several languages.  There is no case or bag to keep the headphones in.  This is a no-frills item, to say the least.Seeing the headphones packaged in such a cheap way I was instantly skeptical about how they would sound.  I plugged them in to my iPhone 5c and streamed some of my music from Amazon's cloud for listening.  I was immediately blown away by the excellent sound reproduction through these headphones.  The mid-range was clear, and the high frequency sounds were very audible and crisp.  Bass was full and firm and not at all muddy or booming.  I listened to several different types of music from Pink Floyd to Allman Brothers to popular vocalists, and the music consistently sounded absolutely great. The sound was consistently good whether I listened at high or low volume levels.  There was no rattle when I cranked them up loudly.  I could not help but compare them by listening to the same music through other more expensive headphones that I own from Sennheiser, Bose, and VModa and was shocked at how much better the Skullcandy headphones sounded.  Usually, most headphones require a break-in period of several hours of listening before they will sound right.  These Skullcandy headphones sound perfect right out of the box.  Truly amazing.Clearly, these headphones were designed for usage with smart phones and other mobile devices.  The headphones have a built-in microphone (which I did not test as I don't use headphones to talk on the phone) and a button on the left ear cup that allows you to answer and end phone calls, turn sound on and off while listening to music, and switch between music tracks.  They are lightweight and comfortable to wear.  The headband adjusts easily.As I pointed out, this is a very no-frills product.  The packaging is cheap, and there is no case or bag to keep the headphones in.  The headphones cannot be folded up for compact storage. The detachable cable has standard 1/8 inch stereo plugs but no adapter to 1/4 inch size is included, so you will have to purchase this separately to use these headphones with a home receiver.  The cable is straight and not coiled or non-kink, but it seems sturdy enough to hold up over time.  It is not long enough for listening across the room from the sound source, but keep in mind these were designed for use with mobile devices and not a home stereo.The sound from these headphones, though, rivals that from headphones costing far more than these, and you get that wonderful sound right out of the box.  If you are looking for good-sounding headphones for not a lot of money, these Skullcandy Grind headphones are a steal for the sound reproduction you get in return.  I was truly amazed by how great they sound and have thoroughly enjoyed listening to music with them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZQIVJOL3SYFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TS1AZJ8#wasThisHelpful","R1ZQIVJOL3SYFM","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For many years I have been in search of a quality, compact grooming kit.  Over the years I have had kits given to me as gifts, and have purchased kits myself, but all have been the typical Chinese junk one finds at the local discount stores.  For a long time I have had to settle for nice nail clippers made in Japan, which I really like, but I have still lacked the nice matched set I've wanted.  So when I received the opportunity to review the Zwilling J.A. Henckels grooming set I got very excited.  The set arrived in today's mail and was perfect timing as my nails have very much been in need of a trim, and I have been waiting for the set to arrive.First off, this is not just over-priced junk.  This is a very precision-engineered grooming set manufactured by the same company known for its premium chef knives.  This grooming set falls in that same category of quality craftsmanship where you get what you pay for.  So before fainting at the price keep in mind you are paying for very high quality.The set arrives in a nice box for gifting, and the grooming tools are neatly arranged in a stylish, thick leather case with a zipper closure.  There are only 5 tools in the set, but the case is overly large and has extra slots in it that lead me to believe it was designed to hold additional tools (a comb and/or razor, perhaps?).  Each tool has its own slot with the longer file and cuticle pusher needing to be kept at the edges of the case or it won't close.  The case is a bit bulky for this grooming set, but the leather is very nice and no doubt contributes to some of the high cost of this set.The nail clippers are very unique and frustrated me at first.  Unlike other clippers, these are designed to fold completely flat for storage and arrive that way.  To open them you must gently pull back on the top half of the clipper (there is a small ribbed area on it to give you a surface to pull it backward with) which allows the two pieces to separate a little bit.  This is where I got initially frustrated as the tool will not clip or work properly without taking the additional step of lifting the back end of the upper clipper upward and then pushing it forward to lock it into a clipping position.  I don't know if the one I received had a stuck spring or if I just didn't use it correctly at first, but once I figured it out I had no problems using the clipper.  The manufacturer really should provide a little instruction sheet with this set as I have no doubt many have been frustrated thinking the clipper was useless from not knowing how to open it correctly.  The clippers are so lightweight and frail-feeling that I was afraid they might break easily, but I quickly found that very little force is needed for them to precisely cut my nails.  And when I say cut, I mean cut.  These have very precise and sharp edges that cut the nail off with absolutely no jagged edges or tearing like ordinary clippers.  Even the fine Japanese nail clippers I own do not cut this easily and precisely.  After clipping my nails I found little need for usage of the nail file, although the file in this kit is equally nice and works great.The scissors in this kit are also remarkable in their precision and sharpness.  The rounded tip makes them very safe for trimming eyebrows, nose hairs, and hair that always seems to grow out of men's ears as we get older.  There is nothing particularly special about the cuticle pusher/nail cleaner or tweezers.  They have the same look and feel as the other tools in the set, but for my purposes won't see that much use.  In a perfect world, for the cost involved, it seems like a small stainless steel comb should have been included in this set.Overall, this is a very fine grooming set.  I would say this is what I have had in mind in my years of searching for a quality groomng set.  The cost of this set will not be appealing or likely appropriate for many men, but for the man who appreciates quality and wants a nice grooming set to stay well-groomed this Zwilling J.A. Henckels grooming set is definitely worth its cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLMRFTI57AKU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006HMAT9C#wasThisHelpful","RLMRFTI57AKU8","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Harley Street Glide that I use this with to keep the jiffy stand from sinking in asphalt.  The pad is a little bit difficult to position under the jiffy stand mainly due to the ridge that sticks up on the top of the pad.  Once it is in position, though, it works well to keep the jiffy stand from sinking into asphalt on a hot day.  There is a hole on one end of the pad and, like another reviewer suggested, I have some paracord attached to it that I tie onto the handle bar so I can easily pick the pad back up while seated on the bike.I would like this pad better if it didn't have the ridges sticking up on it (I really can't see any use for this) but outside of that annoyance it does its job well.  If you ride and park a motorcycle on asphalt in hot weather (who doesn't?) you really need a gadget like this if you don't want to find your bike laying over sideways after a few hours parked in the heat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O6J63WJW8NPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPGQ2DG#wasThisHelpful","R1O6J63WJW8NPY","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Ford F150 pickup that doesn't get much use in the winter.  In the past I have had trouble keeping the battery adequately charged during those months so it won't be dead in the spring.  This Forney trickle charger is fantastic.  I wish I had bought this years ago.  The charger is smaller than I though it would be, and is also quite lightweight.  My pickup sits in our driveway, and I was able to connect the charger to the battery and close the hood to my truck to prevent theft while charging with an extension cord.  After a few hours of charging my truck fired up without a moment's hesitation.  This is a great charger and well worth its very affordable price.  If you have a garaged vehicle that you want to keep charged you can leave it connected to the charger.  There is absolutely nothing to dislike about this charger.

"I use inexpensive microfiber towels that I purchase from a large club store to detail my vehicles and clean firearms.  The ones I use, though, are solid color, smaller, and not suitable for use as a household towel.  So even though the DII towels are more expensive I was curious to see if these would be worth their higher price for household and kitchen usage.The towels arrive neatly folded in a large plastic bag.  The photo of them on Amazon really does not do them justice as the pattern and coloring of the towels is much more attractive than the photo suggests.  These are attractive towels, and they make for nice hand towels in the bathroom and kitchen.  Being microfiber they are very soft and will not scratch glass, so they are ideal for cleaning and polishing anything including glass or plastic.  They are much larger in size than the bulk towels I have bought locally which makes them more useful for larger jobs or for usage as a hand towel.  They do shrink a little after laundering, but this was to be expected, and the shrinkage is not excessive.In summary, the DII microfiber cleaning towels are large in size, very attractive in appearance, and a great value in bulk purchase for usage as hand towels and cleaning towels around the home.  While they may cost more than ones you can find at the discount club stores, these towels are larger and much more attractive for usage inside the home making them worth the additional cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CD4D7TU8NPPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRQ4S2C#wasThisHelpful","R1CD4D7TU8NPPN","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a Bissell cordless stick vacuum that has worked fairly well, but it has a Ni-Cad battery in it and doesn't hold a charge very long.  So when I saw the Electrolux Ergorapido Lithium Ion Plus cordless vacuum I had to give it a try.The vacuum arrives almost completely assembled.  You simply have to remove and replace a single screw to attach the handle assembly to the main body of the stick.  There is a cord that runs from the handle to the removable hand vac so the vacuum can be turned on/off from either the handle of the upright frame or from the detachable hand vac itself.  It's a pretty clever feature, actually.The instruction paper that is included with the product is pretty poorly written, but it is not difficult to figure out how to use the vacuum and all of its features.  I tried several times to register the vacuum and download an electronic version of the instruction sheet but was unsuccessful despite numerous attempts.  The Electrolux web site and product support is quite poor in this regard, and I hope they will get this corrected.The instructions advise charging the vacuum for 24 hours prior to the first usage.  After that the vacuum can be recharged in 4 hours and will run for about 20 minutes on a single charge.  Unlike our Bissell unit, the Electrolux Li-ion unit can be left on its charger, and the light on the charger will blink very slowly to indicate that the unit is fully charged and has switched to a maintenance charge to keep the battery up.  This is a nice feature and should not shorten the life of a lithium ion battery.The fully assembled stick vacuum is lightweight and pushes easily across the floor.  There are brushes in the head of the stick to facilitate vacuuming.  This type of vacuum really works best on hard floors and really can't compete with a conventional vacuum on carpet except for very low pile carpeting.  We have hardwood floors and flat rugs in our home, and the vacuum works really well for quick clean-up jobs.  The head swivels very freely and is extremely easy to move around obstacles on the floor.  The stick is designed so the vacuum can be left standing upright without it falling over.The hand vac section is easily removed from the stick body and is handy for small vacuuming jobs.  There is a thin plastic extension included that fits into the opening of the handvac to extend its reach into smaller areas.  There is also a small, soft plastic brush attachment that fits into the end of the plastic extension so the hand vac can be used for dust removal.  The instructions don't show it, but there is a little wedge in the back up the upper part of the stick handle to hang the extension for storage when not in use.The container in the hand vac body that collects debris is pretty small and does not hold much before it needs to be emptied.  It is no smaller than other similar hand vacs, though.  There is a double filtration system in the debris container that can be washed with water if necessary, although it has to be fully dried before using it in the vacuum again.Overall, my wife and I are very pleased with the Electrolux Ergorapido Lithium Ion Plus vacuum.  It is versatile, lightweight, easy to keep charged, and works well.  It costs about twice what one might spend for a quality cordless hand vacuum, but being able to use it as both a stick vacuum and a hand vacuum makes the added cost worthwhile due to the added versatility.  The Electrolux web site does not provide very good product support due to its web design, but I would hope they will improve this over time, and I would not let that sway you from buying this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R204SXT12OQRZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1P3WNE#wasThisHelpful","R204SXT12OQRZL","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love tacos and for years have wanted a way to heat the shells without the shells deforming and collapsing.  This rack solves that problem.  It is simple to assemble, and it separates into four flat pieces that are easily stored in its original package in a drawer.  Functionally, this rack is perfect.  I can heat up to 6 taco shells standing them upright on a baking sheet.  The shells keep their original shape after heating them making it easy to fill them with taco meat.  Even better, I can toast the shells, fill them with meat, and then melt some cheese on top by putting the rack back into the oven for a minute or two.  Overall, I absolutely love this taco rack.  It seems over-priced, but for me the higher price s worth paying for the convenience of creating perfect tacos in the oven.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OM7IPM3YHJS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018STDWO#wasThisHelpful","R1OM7IPM3YHJS8","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Years ago I owned a ""Mickey ticker"" that I loved but lost, so when I came across this watch while perusing Amazon one day I had to buy it.  The watch looks much nicer than the photo makes it appear.  It's very stylish in appearance and has a heft that makes it feel very well-made.  There is no date feature on it, but it seems to keep time well.  My only complaint with this watch is the leather band that comes with it is far too small for most men.  My wrist is not that large, and I can barely strap it on.  So if this watch will be used by a man you should plan on purchasing another wrist band.  Aside from that, though, it is a very nice watch and fun to wear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R379PNEWYETARO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TOXP3W#wasThisHelpful","R379PNEWYETARO","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this tool after reading about it in one of the gun magazines recently.  It is a handy tool to keep in my range bag when shooting my AR-15 rifle.  Most of the implements swing out like a Swiss Army knife, and there is a small compartment built in to hold small things like screws.  I will likely never use most of the implements on this tool, but it is nice to know they are available if needed while at the range.  Like the other Avid tool that I own for handguns, this AR-15 tool is well-constructed and well thought-out to meet a shooter's essential needs without a lot of baggage.  This tool comes with a tough fabric carry case that can be attached to a belt or pack if desired.  I'm very pleased with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26PQ5H7VFOHCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMHX5KA#wasThisHelpful","R26PQ5H7VFOHCQ","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a carton of these furnace filters a year or so ago and just got done ordering another carton of them.  They are well-made and filter air well.  I have used each filter for about 3 months before replacing it.  In our home a carton of these will last a year and a half.

"I purchased two of these recently, one for my wife and one for myself, to keep handy for personal protection purposes.  My wife often has to work until well after dark, so I wanted something small she could easily carry in he purse and hold in her hand while walking to her car.  This Sabre red pepper spray fits the bill perfectly.  The device is much smaller than I thought it would be, which is a real plus.  At first I thought the built-in hand strap was too small, but I quickly realized it stretches making it easy to strap it onto even my large hand.  Usage of the spray is quick and intuitive.  You merely turn a lever on the top with your thumb, and it is ready to spray.  I tested it out and not only did it spray without a problem but the spray shot out a good 10 feet or more.  I have no doubt this little sprayer would work very well against any close encounter threats.  Add the fact that the sprayer can administer over 30 sprays per canister and you can't beat it for the money spent.  Compared with a Kimber product that I bought a few years ago, that was far more expensive, much larger in size, and had fewer available sprays to it, this Sabre red pepper spray is perfect for a non-lethal form of self defense.  I highly recommend it and will be buying more of these in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UYYVAR1G38E5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002E6RERU#wasThisHelpful","R1UYYVAR1G38E5","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of men's colognes the ones I like are those with light scents that are more subtle and appreciated most up close rather than the strong, harsh scents that can be smelled from across the room.  Up to now I have liked one from Taylor of Old Bond Street quite well, but my wife wears perfume from Calvin Klein that smells quite good, so I was curious to see what Calvin Klein's euphoria might be like.euphoria arrives nicely packaged, and its bottle is larger and heavier than I would have expected for only a 1 ounce supply.  Its mister sprays a light amount of cologne.  Not knowing if I would like the scent or not, I first used it right before exercising figuring I could easily shower it off afterwards if I didn't like it.  I found the scent to be quite pleasant with a faint hint of citrus to it, but the scent is far more complex than that.  The scent is light when applied, and I found it intensified when I started sweating during exercise.  I like the scent, and I was surprised to find that it persisted even after I showered after exercising.  It lingered for many hours afterward as well.  So there is no question this cologne will stay with you throughout the day or evening.Describing the scent of a cologne is a lot like trying to describe a color and really needs to be experienced to understand and appreciate it.  I can say I really like the scent of Calvin Klein euphoria.  It is light, pleasant, and lingering yet not overpowering.  It is an ideal scent to wear for any intimate occasion.  Because the scent is subtle yet pleasing, I can easily envision women wanting to get closer to smell it.  I know my wife likes it.I will say Calvin Klein euphoria is quite expensive compared with any other cologne I have used up to now.  Before purchase one would be wise to visit the perfume department of a local department store to sample it before spending this amount of money on a new cologne.  The largest size appears to be a much better value for the money, so if you really like euphoria you would be best off spending a little more up front to get the larger size bottle.  It should last a long time even with regular usage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FANPSMP6EFS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FWXJQ4#wasThisHelpful","R2FANPSMP6EFS1","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The copy of ""Reagan: The Life"" that was sent to me for review was a softcover ""gallery"" print meaning that it is not a finished product.  For that reason some of my comments in this review may not accurately reflect the finished hardbound version of this book.  I presume the gallery print is pretty complete, though, so I expect the bulk of the content of the book I received is essentially what a purchaser of the finished product would read.The book proclaims itself to be a comprehensive biography of Ronald Reagan.  It does start off with his childhood and progresses rapidly into his adulthood.  The author spends a lot of time juxtaposing the politics and surrounding events of each time period  in Reagan's life that he is trying to depict.  This happens so frequently that the book reads more like a history book with comments about Reagan along the way rather than a biography with a primary focus on Ronald Reagan himself.  As such one does not finish this book feeling they have learned a lot about Ronald Reagan as a person.  This is sad as I have long felt Reagan was not only one of our most important and influential presidents in modern times but also a man of high ethical standards and morals.  The author hints at this a little bit but really doesn't flesh this out very well.  In fact, there are times when the author presents Reagan in an unflattering light, implying he was a poor student, a poor athlete in school, and an unsuccessful actor.  Any mention of Reagan's first wife, Jane Wyman, is so brief that one would easily miss it.  There is equally brief mention of the two children he had with her and literally no mention of his family life with her.  A little more text is devoted to his second wife, Nancy, but even she, who so profoundly influenced Reagan's life and decisions, is discussed very little.  The book I received had no photos in it whatsoever, which I think is a staggering omission in a biography about such an important person.  I sincerely hope the final print has some photos of Reagan throughout various stages of his life to help bring him to life a little better.While very lengthy, almost 800 pages, I did find this an interesting and easy book to read.  Unlike a typical history book, this biography presents a lot of political history along with information about Reagan in a manner that is interesting and not dry to read.  The author does seem to do a good job of highlighting some of the most important events that occurred throughout Reagan's early adulthood, his years in radio and acting, and his political life but barely mentions much of his private or personal life.  There are numerous sources of information listed in the final pages of the book, although none of these sources were footnoted in the text that I received.  One would hope the final edition contains the relevant footnotes.Overall, I found ""Reagan: The Life"" to be a biography worth reading.  It does not flesh out Reagan, the man, as well as I would have liked, but it does a good job of describing Reagan, the great communicator, and Reagan, the leader.  I enjoyed reading it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MZFPCRC8CCWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536399#wasThisHelpful","R3MZFPCRC8CCWD","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My order of Jolly Rancher candy arrived in today's mail, and I am sucking on a piece of this tasty candy while writing this review.  Those familiar with Jolly Rancher candies know exactly what to expect with this candy.  It is hard candy, and their flavors are always very intense, fruity, and delicious.  This blue raspberry flavor is no exception.This particular product is an 88 ounce (almost 5 pounds) bag of candy.  That is a lot of candy.  As another reviewer pointed out, the bag it arrives in is not resealable, so if it is not going to be used up all at once at a party or some other large gathering you will probably want to store it in a bag or container that can be sealed so it will stay fresh, although I doubt candy this good will remain uneaten for very long.  I see Jolly Rancher also offers a similar bag of candy in watermelon flavor, which I am sure would also be delicious.  I think this size bag of candy would be a more attractive offer if there was a mix of flavors rather than just a single flavor in such a large bag.My only complaint with this product is its cost.  I have a hard time picturing someone spending $25 on a bag of candy.  That's about $5 per pound, which seems pretty expensive for candy other than gourmet chocolate.  But if cost is not an issue, and you need a big bag of hard candy, you will never go wrong with Jolly Rancher.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQHKFIF8JXRPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3WWWMO#wasThisHelpful","RQHKFIF8JXRPH","ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLA5CJH0ZZHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 3:09 Mins Another great quality external battery product from Anker! This slick aluminum 13,400mAh battery is a power horse in a sleek small package.If you find the video and review helpful...please hit the YES button below this review. Thanks!This new Anker PowerCore+ 13,400mAh battery combines their proprietary PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology into one sleek metallic package. The aluminum anodized housing is super solid and well built. The two  charging technologies combine to provide the fastest possible charge up to 2.4 amps per port.The VoltageBoost tech actually measures the resistance in the cables you are using, and adjusts the output voltage as necessary to maintain as quick as charge as possible.NOTE:  Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 output not supported. It will NOT fast charge your Galaxy Note 4, Note 5, S6 S6 Edge, or S6 Edge +.It will charge my Galaxy S6 Edge Plus' 3000mAh battery up to 4 times! This is important as most newer flagship devices from Samsung and Apple do not have removable/replaceable batteries, and these external batteries are becoming more and more important.The package also includes the user manual, mesh carrying case, and a MicroUSB cable.Anker offers a crazy good 18 month no hassle warranty. So you have little to loose in trying out this battery.I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20UJNWFJF5NWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HSWY5K#wasThisHelpful","R20UJNWFJF5NWG","AAC6H648IWEKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAC6H648IWEKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I like that.  The smell is more minty than medicine.

"The Apexel lens kit expands the photo opportunities of your cell phones built in lens. Great quality lens set, at a fantastic price.The attachment clip that comes with this kit will fit most phones and/or tablets. This is a really good thing. Because most other special effects lenses on the market are usually geared towards a specific phone type, and are built into a special case you need to use for the lenses to work.With this design, the lens clips to your phone, and the lens attachment covers your camera. You can focus the lens by twisting them while in the adapter.I found each of the 3 lens combination to work great, and as advertised. I was actually quite please with the result. The kit includes a micro fiver lens cleaning cloth, a small case to store everything, the clip, a wide angle lens, a fish eye lends, and a macro lens.The lens I was really most impressed with was the macro lens! It works amazingly well! Almost like a microscope. I attempt to demonstrate all the lenses in my video review. It's better to see it than describe it here.

Thanks!Being stuck in a dark parking lot at night with a dead car battery, waiting over an hour for roadside assistance is a scary prospect. That is why having the security of the DB Power jump start external battery is worth its weight in gold!This battery is solidly built. Fit and finish is top notch. The kit comes with a set of jump starter cables that you attach to your dead battery. The red light on the jumper cables will turn green, and you start your car. Super easy. This device is rated at 400 amps peak power, and at 12,000mAh, you should get multiple jump starts from one charge. I set a calendar reminder in my phone to make sure I check the charge of this every two months.There is also two 2amp outputs built into this device that provides charging power for your phone or tablet. There is also a built in LED light that is very handy, as well as a compass. Moreover, this Jump starter with built-in AI technology can deliver the power intelligently once you connect the power cord and clamps on to the car, so you can directly trigger the engine button to jump start the car without pressing the ON/OFF button.This DBPower product is super solid, and works great.

If you find the video and review helpful...please hit the YES button below this review. Thanks!These Snore Vents worked great. I had no discomfort. And I was able to breathe well. It took a few tries on my part testing out the different sizes supplied before I found the one that fit perfect, and did not cause me discomfort while sleeping.There are 4 supplied sizes in the package as well as a carrying case. I used the 2nd largest pair, and they worked well. They manage to do what they are supposed to, and that is to keep open your nasal passageways while you are sleeping. I suffer from bad allergies, and have difficulties breathing in the evening. I have been using Breath Right strips every night up until now. But, at $13 bucks a box, it starts to get expensive, and I did not like the adhesive it left on my nose every morning.These Snore Vents are very reusable, all you need to do is rinse them in soapy water, and let dry.They stay in my nose, and after a day or two using them I forgot they were there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39LUFRK0C7Z79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011M7N3F8#wasThisHelpful","R39LUFRK0C7Z79","AAC6H648IWEKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAC6H648IWEKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This super bright LED solar light from OxyLed is an amazing addition to a dark spot on your yard.As you watch my review you will see that it took me a few minutes to figure out how to actually turn this light on. Make sure you read the instructions!! There is a small pin included in the package that you need to use to turn on and set the correct mode of this light. The two models are either a constant on mode when it gets dark, or the lights comes on when it detects motion.But once this bad boy comes on it we blind you! There are a boat load of LED bulbs that are very bright.The bottom half of this light is plastic, as is the mounting bracket. The upper half where the large solar panel is is made from brushed aluminum. Its a good looking package over all, and is very well built and sturdy. It should provide years of service.The light does a great job in illuminated the side of the house where I mounted it. I set it to come on at sundown.

"My friend Simon sent me this rugged waterproof Bluetooth speaker to review. There are a lot of cool accessories that come included in the box: a caribeener (to hang), a USB to USB cable, and a Aux Audio cable.The housing is a metal speaker grill,What is really, really cool is that there is an included 5200mAh built in battery that you can use to recharge your wireless devices! You can do all this while listening to your music over the excellent sounding Bluetooth speakers. Bass in strong, and these speakers are really very load.This speaker has excellent fit and finish. It definitely feels high end. The whole speaker is encased a rubber housing to help it withstand drops and bumps.Pairing the Bluetooth is fairly easy and straight forward. The speaker includes Bluetooth 4.0, so it provides for superior sound transfer.I really like this speaker... it is well made, it sounds great, it is affordable, and it has a built in battery to recharge my devices.

"This little low tech stud finder works like an absolute champ!!! I was easy able to find the stud bolts in my wall to identify where I wanted to mount the TV wall mount. Once I found the stud, the stud finder ""stuck"" to the wall like magic, which allowed my to place my drill marks. The addition of the built in level is nice touch, and a huge help.

"This wall mount is a truly excellent value! Not only do you get a sturdy and well made wall mount, you also get a level, and a 10' long HDMI cable! I went shopping for a wall mount in both Target and Walmart... and neither one of the stores had a TV wall mount for less than $79. This one came to me for about $35 bucks with free 2 day Prime shipping, with the extra goodies. The only other thing I had to buy was a stud finder.The wall mount is very easy to assemble and install. This was the first time I has attempted an install such as this, so I took my time to make sure my valuable investment would not fall off the wall. My 50"" tv is not securly hung on my wall, and I can easily changes the viewing angle.The only small hiccup I had was that mu Google Chrome dongle stuck out the back of the TV a little to much, and I had to use the TV's side HDMI input... not a big deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQC96DCGHUUDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TIG36C#wasThisHelpful","RQC96DCGHUUDI","AAC6H648IWEKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAC6H648IWEKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OxyLed makes really great solar products for the home. The are sturdy, weather proof, and work as advertised, and are a really great value. If you find this review valuable and helpful, please hit the THANKS button below.This light is definitely no exception to the previous lights I have reviewed for them. This solar yard light has 8 bright LED'd powered by a large solar panel collector. There is the ability to set it to come at night or to act as a motion sensor, turning on the lights when motion is detected in the area. This light works great in both modes.The light throws a really bright beam, and I am using it in a very dark area along the side of my house. The light has a pretty compact size, and is very easy to install. There are just 2 screws needed, and they are provided in the package. There is also a large piece of double stick tape included if you want to mount it that way.All in all, a great product from OxyLed.

"I love this TRONFY 1080p DIGITAL LED PROJECTOR! It is a truly solid product in a small package that is truly affordable. I did a full HD video review on YouTube. Just search for ""TRONFY 1080p DIGITAL LED PROJECTOR REVIEW"". If you find the video and review helpful...please hit the YES button below this review. Thanks!First off... I think this projector does a really good job at what its designed to do... and that is to project images onto a screen at a high resolution. And this projector does that.I use this projector perfectly with my Google Chromecast dongle. It takes about 30 seconds to get setup, and I am watching Netflix on a wall in my house at about 100 inches. All you need to do is to adjust the focus, and adjust the viewing angle. Both very easy to do.There is also a very comprehensive menu system in this LED projector, so you can tweak settings as needed to get a picture you want.This projector has a output of 1000 Lumens. This is just fine for a home environment with the lights off in the room. Which is how I tend to watch movies anyway. So again, no issues with this box.There are multiple input sources for you to get your video on the screen. Again, I easily use a Chromecast dongle. Sound on this projector is OK, and you can add a external speaker if desired.The remote control is great, and is very responsive. It makes setting up the menus much easier.All in all a really good product for under a $100 bucks!I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIV8J2JKL4RJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOI31K4#wasThisHelpful","RIV8J2JKL4RJR","AAC6H648IWEKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAC6H648IWEKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anglink sent me this newly released compact selfie stick to do a review for.So, to start off... The packaging is great. I really like the design of the product and the concept.The handle of this stick has built in Bluetooth shutter controls. You unfold the rest of the handle, and there is a spring loaded ""X"" that opens to hold your device. It held my iPhone 5 just OK. I was not 100% comfortable with the safety of my phone in this cradle setup.Additionally, the extension part of the ""pole"" is super shaky! I wish it wasn't, but I could not hold the phone steady to take a good picture or video.Bluetooth pared easily with my phone.

"This book is absolutely amazing! Short of actually getting out on the water and sailing, or taking a traditional class, this book does a great job of teaching the basics of sailing a boat. It is laid out in step by step chapters that walk you through the basics, and get you up to advanced skills you will need to know including navigation and weather.It is a large book, with many illustrations, photos, and references.

"My review really should be 3.5 stars. I liked the book much more.This story ends exactly where the last book ends. So they do not miss a beat in the story line. And thus begins the journey of pages and pages and pages of Harry and Jack running and dodging ""goons"" (their words) from Global Alliance. The story is one not so long (its not a very long book) cat and mouse story where they have to find boats, cars, and bike to get to their final destination. The end was more interesting when they finally made it to their destination, and were not having to run away at every black Range Rover that seems to be around the corner. In this apocalyptic state, with no electricity, internet, radios, etc, it is a little too far fetched that the ""goons"" were always easily able to find these guys.Anyway... the end of the story leads into the third book. I am already invested into two of them, so I will more than likely read it to see how it all ends.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23TX4EUNHGKR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVD4DBY#wasThisHelpful","R23TX4EUNHGKR8","AAC6H648IWEKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAC6H648IWEKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this quality made sleep mask from Smarter Rest! It does a really great job at what is designed to do, and that is to keep out the light while trying to sleep.This sleep mask is made from a really nice grade of very soft satin. It feels amazing. The mask is very light weight. The inside (or the part that touches your face) is a super soft cotton material. The Velcro straps are adjustable. The straps are also wide for a better fit and comfort. There are a pair of soft memory foam ear plug included, and built into the sleep masks straps (so you can't loose them)! The package also includes instructions and a guide, as well as a satin storage case for your mask.The masks performed wonderfully! It successfully blocked out all ambient from a well lit room. It stays in place, even after tossing and turning on a pillow. In fact, it is a little disconcerting because it is so dark when you open your eyes, I have to remember I have the sleep mask on.

If you find the review helpful...please hit the YES button below this review. Thanks!All in all, this is a great product. It does what it is designed to do, and it does it well.

"The pictures on Amazon do not do this speaker justice! This speaker kicks out crazy deep bass, and is really loud. This speaker from Arespark really belts it out! I did a full video review that I posted to You Tube. You can find it easily by searching for ""Arespark Camo Bluetooth Speaker Review"". If you find the video and review helpful...please hit the YES button below this review. Thanks!First of all, the speaker ships in a really nice hard plastic package. I am keeping the packaging so I can store the speaker when I am not using it. In the package there is the speaker, instruction, a MicroUSB charging cable, a Audio to MicroUSB audio cable, and a carabiner  so you can hang the speaker someplace for easy listening.Pairing the speaker is very simple. Controls are are large and are located right on top of the speaker, so they are very easily accessible. The only small complaint is that to raise the volume, you have to push and hold the skip forward button for three seconds. A separate volume control would have been a nice addition. But, once you crank the volume up, listening volume is easily adjustable via the controls and Bluetooth on your phone.Sound is very crisp. With the volume turned up this speaker is very loud, with very deep bass. You can feel the bass pumping through the table top the speaker was place on. Thankfully there is a rubber base on the bottom of the speaker to prevent it from sliding around due to vibrations.I like this speaker... a lot! I think I was a little surprised. Not sure why.

The arms that go over your are comfortable and sturdy. You can remove these arms and replace it with the included elastic headband. This is great for more active sports where you don't want your glasses flying off your head.In the package there is an additional next strap, so your glasses can hang from you neck. There is also a very necessary micro fiber cleaning cloth to clean the lenses. There is also a small fabric satin like case you place your glasses into for extra protection from scratches.Changes the lenses is fairly simple. They unsnap, and snap back in relatively easily. Be forewarned that you will get fingerprints all over the lenses when you do this. It's pretty much unavoidable. Not a big deal, just use the included cloth to clean them.I found the included lenses to be really nice. They each function as they are supposed to. I could easily see out of them, and felt that they covered and protected the my eyes well. Personally I do not need all the different lenses, I am really just using the dark polarized lens. There is also a little card in the box to test the polarizing aspects of the lens.I think there is a lot of value in this kit.

" 4:38 MinsNever get stuck with a dead battery again with this 12,000mAh 400Amp battery jump starter set from RoyPow. I did a complete video review of this product and it is on You Tube. If you search over there for ""RoyPow J12 All in One 12000mAh Car Jumper Kit Review"" you can find it easily. If you find the review helpful...please hit the YES button below this review. Thanks!Being stuck in a dark parking lot at night with a dead car battery, waiting over an hour for roadside assistance is a scary prospect. That is why having the security of the RoyPow J12 jump start external battery is worth its weight in gold!This battery is solidly built. Fit and finish is top notch. The kit comes with a set of jump starter cables that you attach to your dead battery. The red light on the jumper cables will turn green, and you start your car. Super easy. This device is rated at 400amps peak power, and at 12,000mAh, you should get multiple jump starts from one charge. I set a calendar reminder in my phone to make sure I check the charge of this every two months.There is also two 2amp outputs built into this device that provides charging power for your phone or tablet. There is also a built in LED light that is very handy, as well as a compass. Moreover, this Jump starter with built-in AI technology can deliver the power intelligently once you connect the power cord and clamps on to the car, so you can directly trigger the engine button to jump start the car without pressing the ON/OFF button.The only two negative I will speak off are:- I will there was a storage case to place this in along with the cables. I want to keep this in my trunk, and I do not want it to flop around.- I would have liked to have seen a AC and/or a DC power adapter included. I have reviewed a few other of these types of devices, and they all included AC and DC power adapters and cases.Aside from that this RoyPow product is super solid, and works great. I have also communicated with the manufacturer, and they truly listen to the feedback of their users, and I was told they are working hard to include the accessories I mentioned above.I was sent this product in exchange for an unbiased product review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J0ENZKZL5UU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WYO2TMM#wasThisHelpful","R1J0ENZKZL5UU6","AAC6H648IWEKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAC6H648IWEKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A GoPro camera is somewhat useless without an assortment of mounts.  Purchasing GoPro mounts individually can add up quickly from a cost perspective.  This GoPro mounts bag from Puluz contains an assortment of essential GoPro mounts.  The head strap, chest mount and suction mount are some of the most common mounts that it includes.  It also includes a LOT MORE plus adhesive mounts as well.  I love how it contains an assortment of GoPro-style thumb screws as well.  Those are always easy to lose while in the field and it's great to have extras handy!  I wish that it contained a frame-style housing but other than that, it's the perfect assortment of essential GoPro mounts IMO.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23NQQWHLFE636/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UH0AYA#wasThisHelpful","R23NQQWHLFE636","A2LIGTSDHJY7U6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIGTSDHJY7U6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent snorkel and mask kit for travel!  My wife and I previously traveled with a set with much larger fins.  The fins not only added weight to our checked bag but they also consumed a lot of space.  This smaller snorkel set is optimal for travel and it likely costs less than renting inferior snorkeling gear, while in a tropical destination.  I like how the bag is vented, so that it dries quickly when wet.  I also like the build quality of the mask and the snorkel.  I wish that the part behind the foot was a little better made though.  It seems as if the snap will likely wear out after extended use but for a few weeks to various tropical destinations, this snorkel kit seems like it should hold up well!  I like the blue color that I purchased but there are a variety of other color options to choose from too.  I wear a size 12US tennis shoe and the large size fits me perfectly!  I would definitely buy the same set again if I needed another.  It's worth mentioning that although Cressi is touted as an Italian brand, my set said ""made in China.""  That's not an issue for me but I wanted to mention it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGGC9MXHZCTPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB7I18K#wasThisHelpful","RGGC9MXHZCTPV","A2LIGTSDHJY7U6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIGTSDHJY7U6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great way to charge USB devices such as iPad, iPhone, iPod, GoPro batteries and most any USB-rechargeable device. It's great because it consumes a minimal amount of space and has 6 USB charging ports. I prefer charging devices with this vs. a computer's USB ports, since devices won't attempt to synch with the computer while they are charging. The build quality is very top-notch and it looks right at home on my desk alongside my Apple computer equipment.

"If you use a Feiyu gimbal for the GoPro, then this is a must-have add-on.  Just like holding a short monopod vs. a longer monopod, the longer monopod produces smoother and more watchable video in my opinion.  The Feiyu gimbal itself is smooth but while walking, etc. there still can be some noticeable shake.  These poles extend the length of the Feiyu gimbal's handle to make the quality of the video even smooth.  One or two of these extension poles can be screw on.  Actually, if someone wanting to make it even longer, they could buy more poles.  I light how these are small and lightweight to travel with.  My two minor complains are #1 Even though the poles that I received were new, it seems that they left the factory with some sort of oily/sticky substance towards the ends.  That seemed to be surely cosmetic though and I was able to remove it with a paper towel #2 This kit includes a power switch but unfortunately you have to screw off the top handle to turn the power on/off (the switch remains inside and there is no switch on the exterior).  For the intended purpose, this add-on works great and has greatly improved my production quality but those are two minor things that the manufacturer should address to make it better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8THHUF0WQ4RK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S0TBVKG#wasThisHelpful","R8THHUF0WQ4RK","A2LIGTSDHJY7U6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIGTSDHJY7U6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great case for traveling with the DJI Phantom 3, as it has wheels and a pop-out handle for rolling to and from an airport, etc.  It comes in a variety of colors but the bright orange is nice, as it's easy to see.  Should it fall into the water, this case will likely be easier to see and retrieve than a darker color.  For added security, up to two TSA-approved locks can be attached using the included holes.  The interior is perfectly setup for the Phantom 3 (Advanced or Professional) and most common accessories.  This is the type of case that will likely be able to handle most any abuse (careless baggage handlers, rain, etc.) associated with travel.

The brushes are nice too and to be quite honest, all that I'll use from this kit is the retractable brush, cleaning clothes, air blower and squirt bottle for my lens cleaning solution.

"Previously I had purchased an egg timer and modified it for my GoPro panning time-lapses.  I was looking for something that could support the weight of my RX10 II camera and found this.  The build quality is nice but is nothing exceptional.  It's small and light enough to toss inside of my DSLR backpack along with other gear and not really notice that it's there.  The ability to connect a tripod to the bottom is a huge plus!  Operation is very straight-forward and it doesn't require batteries. Simply rotate and 360 degrees is 60 minutes, 180 degrees is 30 minutes and you can do your own math for other degrees of rotation.  It makes a ticking sound while in motion which isn't a problem for me, since I record videos without audio.  It's also nice to have an audible acknowledgement to know that it's working.  One feature that I would like to see in a future version is the ability to choose different rotation speeds.  Sometimes I may not have an hour to spare for a 360-degree time-lapse and some cameras' recording duration and/or battery life could become an issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF9HQPWDU66RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV5LBE2#wasThisHelpful","RF9HQPWDU66RB","A2LIGTSDHJY7U6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIGTSDHJY7U6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the past I only used a UV filter.  That helped to better protect my camera's lens from damage but it didn't do much more.  This filter helps to make beach photos and video look a lot more colorful in my opinion.  Take a photo without this filter and then a photo with this filter.  The visual quality improvement is highly noticeable in my opinion.  I use the 62MM version with my Sony FDR-AX100 and Sony RX10 II cameras.  Also worth mentioning is that there are other brands available but the weight and overall build quality of B+W is the best that I have found.

As soon as I pulled my RX100 IV out of the box, I immediately attached this screen protector to it.  Looking at the RX100 IV, it's next to impossible to tell that a screen protector is installed.  Installation was simple!  It was simply  a matter of visually confirming proper alignment (you may want to turn the camera on to make alignment easier), pushing down and then gently rubbing to ensure that it has adhered properly.

"After breaking my IPhone when it fell to the floor from a CHAIR, I decided to buy a sturdier case. I ordered this one, and yes it very protective, but it makes my IPhone 6s plus, feel really heavy and bulky. Yes, I know, this is what ultimate protection feels like. If it protects my phone, I'm ok with it. My gripe however, is once your phone is in this case good luck getting it out. I actually broke the bottom piece that is next the plug trying to get the phone out. Now, I'm skeptical. If I can break it with my bare hands, how well can it protect my phone? I'm sending this back and waiting for Lifeproof to come out with their case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K73QQED3J1DM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N28AOVW#wasThisHelpful","R3K73QQED3J1DM","APMAMNLZCQJ76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APMAMNLZCQJ76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:24 MinsEDIT 2/25/2015I have uploaded a snippet of video showing the Scooba cleaning my foyer. You can see how wet the floor gets, how the Scooba travels over the floor. Please note there is no audio on the video.Original Review:I have done a lot of research on floor cleaners/scrubbers over the past few days. I will be the first to admit that this product does not get the best reviews here on Amazon, and mixed reviews elsewhere on the internet. I purchased this model for a few reasons:1. The seemingly good customer service from iRobot2. The great track record of the Roomba - I just got my first one today3. I hate mopping my floorsOnce UPS dropped this off, I immediately unpacked it, read over the manuals and let it charge. Oh boy was I anxious. This is a LOT of money to spend on a toy. I didn't want a toy, I wanted a real solution to a real problem, cleaning my floors.I took the Scooba to a bathroom that is about 100 sq. ft. I figured I might as well try it out there, as there is really no obstacles in the room and its a relatively small sized room. I used two capfuls of iRobot Cleaning Solutions, warm water in the tank, and I set it down and pressed 'Clean"". It's good to note, that if you get lost in what you are supposed to do with Scooba, just press the 'I' and it will tell you in plain english what to do. If you set the option for cleaning a small floor, it will clean a room that is about 100 sq. feet in 20 mins. The larger room setting will clean a room that is about 300 sq. ft in 40 mins.At first, my heart sank, as the Scooba just kind of went in circles and no water was on the floor for the first couple of minutes. Then, water started coming out, but still, it was not soaking the floor as the description says it should. Finally, the floor was pretty well saturated with water, and I could see the swirls of the brushes in the water on the floor.The patterns that it chose to follow, seemed haphazard at first, but if you read the manual, you will see that Scooba follows a few circular patterns kind of 'mapping' out the floor. It then proceeded to use an almost random pattern to clean. It got around the perimeter of the room, under the cabinet, and around the toilet. Boy was I impressed. There was not a dry spot in the room.The machine even vacuumed up small hairs and lint that it encountered alog the way, while laying down the soaking layer of water. It would be a good practice though, to vacuum the room first, or let your Roomba roam before you start the Scooba.  The Scooba will suck up small particles, but I don't think it's meant to do a real through vacuum. It is a bit hard to see the cycles that it goes through, because there is no 'starting point'. The Scooba will pass over the floor first sucking up the small particles, laying down the presoak, scrubbing  and finally sucking up all the water that is left. By the end of the cycle, my floor were dry. I could walk on them to retrieve the Scooba and put her back on the charging stand.The final and deciding result was that my floor was really clean, the room smelled fresh and I was pleased. We are going on vacation tomorrow, and this is one job I can cross off my list. Just like many of you, I like to come home to clean house, but I ALWAYS neglect to mop the floors, because frankly, who has time?The Scooba will certainly do well with tile, marble, or stone floors, and they even say hardwoods, but honestly it does lay down a LOT of water. I'm afraid to use it on my bamboo flooring so I purchased a Braava for that. Maybe one day I will try it out on my hardwoods.It does come with 1 virtual wall, but if you have virtual walls from another iRobot product they will work. It is a good idea to use them to confine the Scooba to a smaller space so that it cleans effectively.Some tips to remember:1. Don't expect this to work on your 1000 sq ft floor. It works best on smaller spaces. If you watch the promotional video on IRobot's website, you can see that the spaces that they have it in are smaller. It works best on spaces up to 100 - 350 sq ft.2. If you are expecting to clean your whole house while you drink a glass of wine in the bath, I'm not so sure that this is right for you. Yes, it takes the work out of cleaning your floor but it still needs to be monitored. It may get stuck under something or it may knock something over. But you can still drink your wine while periodically checking on it.3. Make sure you ""Scooba-tize"" your room. Don't expect it to clean your floors, with shoes in the way, mats on the floor, etc. It works best unobstructed.4. Be Realistic - it will not scrub your floors clean that you have not cleaned in the past year without running it a few times. Get in a habit of doing it frequently.5. The battery life is decent. You will probably get one 40 min cycle out of it before you have to recharge it. It recharges in about 2 hours, so go do something else while you wait for it to charge.Overall a great product and I am glad that I purchased it. Now, if they can finally make a clothes dryer that folds my clothes, I'll have it made!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27PTVARABQ7DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IO9U06I#wasThisHelpful","R27PTVARABQ7DA","APMAMNLZCQJ76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APMAMNLZCQJ76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pillow completes the oasis that is my jacuzzi bath. Almost every night I take a long bath. I light candles, have a glass of wine, and watch at least an hour long TV show.I never had a pillow before, and I'm glad I waited to buy just the right one.This pillow is vinyl and suction cups to the edge of the tub from the long rectangular piece, and the rounded part folds down into the tub and sticks there.It is relatively soft, so that you feel like you are relaxing on a real pillow. The vinyl makes the pillow easy to wipe clean and the suction cups are strong, I have not had to restick them since I bought the pillow.I'm glad I purchased this pillow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HEVPV8YLQ5GA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008MP481M#wasThisHelpful","R3HEVPV8YLQ5GA","APMAMNLZCQJ76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APMAMNLZCQJ76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these headphones. First off, they are worn behind the head, and not over your head. They hook slightly over your ears, and are lightweight.I have used these headphones on the treadmill, while cooking dinner and listening to the video on my iPad (my kitchen is near my living room and the family is watching TV while I am cooking dinner), I have used these in my jacuzzi bath, while listening to music or watching a video. I have also used this while cleaning the house.The range is great. I can walk all over my house, and listen to whatever I want, while my device stays in another room. The sound is great, and you can easily control your device - sound, song skipping, and pause and playback from the buttons on the side of the earphones.Pairing is easy, I have it paired to both my iPad and my Kindle Fire with no problems whatsoever. I have not paired it to my phone, as I would not use it for phone calls.Lastly, the battery life is awesome.

"My husband and I stay in hotels a lot, and we like our Starbucks coffee. We went on a trip to Las Vegas where our fancy 5 diamond hotel does not have coffee makers in the room, and our only choice is going to the lobby for Starbucks for at least $3 coffee. We also like to have several cups in the morning, and we needed a solution.We purchased this kettle and purchased the Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Italian Roast Coffee (50 count). Not only does this kettle get the water extremely hot, but it boils quickly and has auto shut off too! Now, we don't have to worry about burning the hotel down. On the plus side, the Starbucks VIA is the best instant coffee I have ever had. Pretty close to fresh brewed coffee.The only con about this little baby is that it is small. You cannot make two 10 oz coffees at one time. However, for size you will gain function and portability.The kettle also comes with I guess they think should be travel cups and spoons, however, they are best fit for a kids tea party and baby food containers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JWHR25WXYW4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARYZH4S#wasThisHelpful","R2JWHR25WXYW4L","APMAMNLZCQJ76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APMAMNLZCQJ76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We purchased this for our boat, and yes it dissolves and not we have not had an issue with it, and we use a vacuflush system.Now, if you're like most boaters, nobody is allowed to doody on the boat, so most times the toilet paper never even goes into the tank.But, if it does, you'll have no problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C1F3CF7YLZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BH5334#wasThisHelpful","R3C1F3CF7YLZH","APMAMNLZCQJ76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APMAMNLZCQJ76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, I have a love hate relationship with this case. The material feel great, the phone fits snug, and it does what it says its supposed to do. The separate credit card 'thingy' that you're supposed to carry around with you to jam into the back to make the phone stand up in landscape view is annoying and dumb. Really? I'm going to carry this thing around with me? Dumb, just make a kickstand.I am on the fence about this case, because after I threw my phone on my handbag, a later found a scratch on the screen protector that I had put on the phone the day I bought it. If I had a case with a cover, that would have not happened.So, if you want a simple case that will cover your phone, and protect against drops, its great. Otherwise, keep looking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14XXR12GT8ZQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTQ57QQ#wasThisHelpful","R14XXR12GT8ZQT","APMAMNLZCQJ76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APMAMNLZCQJ76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE this mirror. This mirror is 5X magnification, versus 10X, which makes me feel like I'm looking in a funhouse mirror. My eyes aren't so bad yet, that I cannot see my face, just yet. On the other hand, the 5X, will definitely make you see EVERYTHING on your face. It's also great to be able to see your WHOLE face too. My other mirror allowed me to see sections of my face at a time. Hated that.I love how it comes on when you come close. No reports yet of the mirror coming on when a ghost is near like some of the other reviewers, but I'll keep an eye out.I love the feel of it. For a mirror that costs as much as this one, it should feel heavy and sturdy, as this one does.I charged it initially when I purchased it and have not needed to charge it since then.Overall a good purchase and I'm happy I bought it. I'm considering the travel one as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37UOIGUL9APC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZSNW3E#wasThisHelpful","R37UOIGUL9APC2","APMAMNLZCQJ76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APMAMNLZCQJ76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eh, it's ok. I had a case similar to this for my Galaxy Note, and it was great. You can manipulate the screen through the cover and it just worked. This case for the iPhone 6 does what it says, it allows to see who's calling, I have had only one success of being able to answer a call while the cover was closed, by sliding my finger along the metal contacts, but thats about it.My issues with the case are not so much with the case, as it's with the phone. Apple does not allow the iPhone to be put to sleep with the case, so if you close the case, you're phone is still on.The case does not stay closed, however on the other hand, you know this going in. If you want a case with a dedicated snap closure, get another case.The materials feel nice, but feels more felt-like than suede or leather.My phone can be viewed in landscape mode easily.

"I purchased these after a manicurist used them on me during a procedure. I previously used to soak off my gel nail polish with a bowl of acetone. That seemed to take forever. These little babies are awesome. Dip the little pads in the polish remover, and wrap around your nails. The wraps will be somewhat secure, as secure as tinfoil on your nails can be. I found it easier to do one hand at a time, because it can be somewhat hard to wrap both hands at once. Wait for about 15-20 minutes and your polish will be melted enough to remove easily. Yes you can probably achieve the same effect with tin foil and cotton balls, but that's a lot of effort when these are already pre-made. I recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KP0AWTXAAPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073KABJ0#wasThisHelpful","R3KP0AWTXAAPJ","APMAMNLZCQJ76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APMAMNLZCQJ76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the Bose QC 20s a while ago, and while I had used them almost exclusively for noise cancelling, I almost never used them for listening to music. Weird right? Well...my husband snores, and rather than killing him, I though it best to wear something to block out the noise.The QC20s allow me to lie next to my husband and never hear his snoring. At All. In fact, I take them off, thinking he has stopped and am surprised to hear that he is still going strong. I also wore these on two flights and all the noise from the flights were silenced almost completely. I barely heard the wailing babies, and the guy behind me who thought it ok to crank up his Ipad because he forgot headphones.I often use my QC 20s to be in the same room with my husband and boys who love to watch football and basketball games, and I honestly cannot hear a thing.Well, just lately, I started using these to listen to my music collections, and it seemed, flat. I feel like I have to crank up the volume to hear the 'color' of the music. I'm not an audiophile, just a regular person that likes to really hear music. In fact, when I listen to my music on my Ipad with the QC15s or the QC3s, and switch to the QC20s, the drop in volume and tone is astounding.Well, I went to Bose and ordered both the QC 15 and the QC 3. The QC 3 blew me away with the beautiful sounds of my music, but the noise cancelling was just so so. I could still hear my husband snoring, the cheers from the televised sports games. Also, the on ear design of the QCs left my ears hurting. I still wanted to use them just so I listen to my music like I never heard before.I received the QC15s and was thinking that the over ear design would surely offer better noise cancelling and great sound for music. Boy was I surprised. I put the 15s on and I could clearly hear my two employees talking across the room. I switched to my QC20s and they sounded like they were far far away. But of course my music sounds great! *Sigh*I am clearly upset as I want both great sound and noise cancelling, but I guess I have to choose. The 15s and 3 will go back, and I will stick with these. It makes more sense to pay for the noise cancelling, rather than the music sound.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R58VNO87OYDD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D429Y12#wasThisHelpful","R58VNO87OYDD6","APMAMNLZCQJ76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APMAMNLZCQJ76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 3 cases for my 10 day old Kindle Fire HDX. Why you ask? Because it is a crime to saddle down this beautiful lightweight tablet with  huge bulky case. I have tried a leather sleeve case, which I like because sometimes I do not like to have a case at all, mostly when reading. I purchased the Amazon Origami case, which makes my HEX feel like a ton of bricks and increases the thickness of the tablet a lot, it's going back tomorrow!What makes this case so great? Here it is in no particular order:1. It's lightweight - does not add much weight to the HDX at all2. It's slim. Your tablet will fit snugly inside the case and it does not increase the thickness .3. Felt like inside cover will protect against scratches on the face4. Camera will operate  in the case5. Button cut outs allow for easy access and use.6. It's slim and lightweight - did I say that already?I love this case.

"My daughter uses her iPad at school and complained about having to use the on screen keyboard. I purchased this and she loves it. Her IPad sits like a little laptop on the keyboard, and it backlit. When closed the case forms a nice case/cover for the iPad. One issue we did have however, was that the keyboard lost the bluetooth signal, and we had to 'forget' the bluetooth settings and then turn the iPad on and off and reconnect the bluetooth before it would work again. Otherwise, good keyboard.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZISSO8PDNE10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AI3RRAA#wasThisHelpful","RZISSO8PDNE10","APMAMNLZCQJ76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APMAMNLZCQJ76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will start out saying, I am a techie, I have several Android tablets and phones, and both Apple iphone and ipad (several versions). I purposely waited to purchase the PRO over the RT version because I knew that the PRO was a full function computer.I needed/wanted a Windows tablet as I work for myself and I wanted a more portable solution. I frequently may need to work with my staff while from a remote location and I also need to work on Office documents and access files from my desktop computer.I have tried (and tried) to use my Ipad and while it offers functionality, nothing beats a Windows Machine. I also wanted a more 'airport friendly' device than a laptop. I'm tired of dragging it out for TSA and trying to beat the other 100 travelers trying to get their shoes and belts back on.I have owned the Surface for 2 days and I couldn't be more pleased. I 'tried' it out by taking it to an office training class, and streaming the web training session, all the while working with my office and answering emails, and looking up accounts.I have set up my computer (Yes I don't call it a tablet) with the office 365 trial, and I have been able to create documents, save to my computer and skydrive and send out via email. Ah!The ONLY issue I have had with my Surface is that my Outlook would not open (the profile) would not open AT ALL. I have been searching in vain for the reason for it, and without getting too technical here I believe it is an issue with the Surface. Google it.I have however, been able to set up the mail and calendar app, and yes it works perfectly, so in retrospect, I don't really need outlook.To answer most FAQs:1. Yes it is small. Too small? No, just right. It is supposed to be portable. Just adjust browser and document settings and you are good to go.2. IT IS A COMPUTER, MORE THAN A TABLET. You have full function capabilities that you would have in a desktop/laptop. I have installed programs, and yes I use a mouse. You actually can use it without a mouse, however I think the combo of tablet gestures and mouse works. I like the wedge mouse, it's small and Bluetooth, so no dongle sticking out of the ONLY usb port.3. I am using the type cover. It is a respectable keyboard and easy to use. I would use this over anything else, since the keyboard is the cover and when you fold it back it disables the keys and you don't accidentally type as its folded back.4. Using it without the keyboard cover is good too. I am actually liking the windows 8 tiles, which took a little getting used to. But now I wish I had windows 8 on my desktop. I lay in bed and use the Surface frequently without the keyboard and it is a good tablet.5. Screen is glossy and gets fingerprinty fast. Use of mouse and the pen works but only so much. I wish the pen had more of dedicated holding spot instead of the charging port. I can see myself losing it, and soon. I bought a carrying case to hold all of the accessories when not in use. Screen protector will probably work to cut down some of the fingerprints but I haven't gotten one yet.6. Battery life.....eh. Not awesome. Today I used the surface while working and it lasted about 5 hours. I did not decrease the screen brightness as I like it high regardless. Yes, I would carry my charger with me.7. Charger has a usb slot to charge another device while charging your Surface. Pretty awesome. I used this to charge my phone while I needed my phone's hotspot to get internet for the Surface the other day.8. It is not a TOY. This is not a kid's tablet or play toy. Yes you can get apps (all types from games to business) but it is a full function portable computer. I'm mad I didn't think of purchasing this for my high school daughter instead of her ipad that she takes to school every day to take notes on.9. Love the kickstand. Some people hate the kickstand, I however think it is perfect for sitting in a chair or laying in bed and not having to prop it up or have some bulky case on it to prop it up. Don't want it, push it in, done!10.I have not watched any movies or played any games on it, and I probably won't. I'm just not a game or movie tablet watcher unless i'm on a airplane.11. It gets a little hot. The battery gets a little hot and its a little heavy. But we are all used to the slim weight of the Ipad and android tables, but compared to a laptop its not heavy, at least to me.12. It is not comparable to an Ipad or any other type of tablet. It is a computer. You will be disappointed if all you are getting it for is to play angry birds.13. Side note about Skydrive (Microsoft's cloud drive) if you set it up on the computer you use and the Surface you can choose/open documents that are saved in the Skydrive as well and the documents that are stored locally on the respective computer. I just found this out today, and it has a great feature. No longer do I need to use Log me in, or the remote desktop tool on the Surface.14. There was an HP Printer app on my Surface which allowed me to connect to the HP Printer in my home right away. I was able to print in seconds, from email, documents, etc.14. I typed this whole review on my Surface, while sitting on my patio.Conclusion: This a a great solution to the tablet world and the real computing world. I'm sad that microsoft wasn't first to market, then everyone would be comparing everything else to this and not the Ipad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROFSNA7UU49QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BE5T2TA#wasThisHelpful","ROFSNA7UU49QS","APMAMNLZCQJ76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APMAMNLZCQJ76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are in doubt, get buy this. I went to Las Vegas for 1 week and took wayyyy to many clothes, but packing and unpacking were the easiest ever with this Pack It Folder.I probably had about 10 shirts, 5 dresses (nice evening types) and a few t shirts packed into this. My suitcase has never been so organized before. Once I got to Vegas, nothing had shifted and I just simply opened the Pack and hung up the dresses & shirts and placed the t-shirts in the drawer.I can't really lie and say there were slightly wrinkled from being folded, but nothing that when they were hung up the wrinkles didn't fall out of.The pack is very durable and the velcro that holds it closed is strong.

"This is my first book by Joyce Carol Oates, which is sad since I found out she is from my hometown of Lockport, NY. Subject matter aside, this book is a bit hard to read. It is written from the prespective of the main characters and sometimes seems a bit jumbled. I think that may be the style of the author, but I'm not sure. The abduction scene played out so many times with almost the same wording I thought I had someone retread the same page many times over.Of course the subject matter is quite disturbing, but in all fairness fascinating as it was told. Yes, I agree with others that the ability of Ms. Oates to get in the head of the kidnapper is extraordinary. There is no graphic detail sex in this book, but the way it is described is probably more graphic than an actual blow by blow description.I can't say that I was surprised by the some parts of the ending, but the actual ending I did not understand.maybe someone can enlighten me, so as not to spoil it for others.I will say this book kept my attention and even had me thinking about it when I was not reading,but I can't say as though it was the best book I've ever read, but it did keep me entertained.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R160V2XAQSCCB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802120997#wasThisHelpful","R160V2XAQSCCB2","APMAMNLZCQJ76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APMAMNLZCQJ76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Louise has been devalued and abused so much at she may never be truly happy with a man again and Spike is just so masculine do they even stand a chance?This is my favourite so far and I'm glad because I've been a little in love with Spike since Diesels book and I just loved Devon and Tommy.This series had a slow start for me but now I'm truly hooked and just waiting for Amy's book but unfortunately I have a longish wait because it's not expected out until 18th March 2016.I'm really going to miss these guys since I've read these four books over the last four days now I've got to find something else to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTFDNVA5273G0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MX9ZAU#wasThisHelpful","RTFDNVA5273G0","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an emotional read and it's one of those books where just when you've written someone off the author makes it impossible for you to hate them.Paige and Chloe may be identical but they're nothing alike, Paige is awful, I'm not talking just rude and ignorant she's devious and conniving and at times positively evil, there's really nothing likeable about her and although we know there's some issue, some reason why she's acting out its hard to see past her behaviour.Then she does something totally unforgivable and I'd decided that was it, there was no coming back from this regardless of her demons.Now Chloe is as different again, she's sweet and has tried her best to befriend her sister she's also had a crush on a club member for years but he's never shown any interest other than friendship but she's eighteen now is it time she let him know how she feels? But even if he feels the same it's forbidden, he's in the MC and she's a members daughter.I read this in one sitting, I just couldn't put it down I was really hoping everything for both these girls, for me it's the strongest book yet and on top of all the existing characters we're introduced to the mysterious Cade, I'm sure we'll catch up with him in the future because I'd like his story.One thing about these books and I should maybe have mentioned it in my previous reviews is that the story continues on, while each book, each character and each romance is a standalone there's always elements which continue which makes reading just one of these difficult which isn't a problem for me because I'm slowly becoming hooked.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TCTZ49RMJG6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011N3MWJO#wasThisHelpful","R2TCTZ49RMJG6E","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While on the whole I enjoyed the previous book 'Diesel' I did have a few reservations and it's the same with this book.Taylor is twenty-six years old, has just moved to England from America and is opening her own hair and beauty salon, she's beautiful, confident, witty and intelligent a difficult combination to ignore which is why when Duke meets her for the first time he's blown away. Taylor is also instantly attracted to Duke but Duke doesn't do relationships, at all, like never plus his life is dangerous and that's not the life that Taylor wants so is there anyway they can battle the odds and make it work?I already liked all the Ace MC characters from 'Diesel' and this book just cemented that, it takes a while getting used this, not only is it a softer read but it's first and foremost a romance and I think that's the difference.Most of the MC books I've read have been gritty and darker with a lot of the story revolving around the club and their activities, building the tension and angst often with a very strong sometimes disturbing thread. This book is more character driven and while it's based around an MC it's the romance that's the main thread, everything else revolves around that and I think I like it for a change, with reservations of course.In 'Diesel' Harlow confused me seeming almost bipolar at times and Taylor also confused me in this book.I was moving on to 'Spike' he's one of my favourites but I've just realised the next book is actually 'Paige and Chloe' so I'll give that a go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH6SFIW2FN2JJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VECC6I2#wasThisHelpful","RH6SFIW2FN2JJ","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harlow is twenty years old and looking for a fresh start, her mother died when she was just four years old and she was raised by her father and his MC The Skulls MC but now her father is dead and she no longer feels comfortable there, in fact the President of the Skulls 'Hawke' made her feel so scared she had to leave.Harlow's dream has always been to be a tattooist so armed with her portfolio she heads for Aces Tattoo shop.Now I have to say I struggled at first with this, even allowing for Harlow being nervous and with everything she'd been through recently she still seemed a bit off, almost bipolar. I don't want to make this a spoiler review but you'll know what I mean if you read it.Harlow meets Diesel and the attraction is instant but they both come with loads of baggage, some of it dangerous. Is it possible for these two to beat the odds?I have to say after the bumpy start I enjoyed this read, a British MC book as well its not often I come cross one of those, although I'm being honest it didn't seem that British.I liked all the Aces MC characters and I'll be reading Dukes book next, its already on my kindle waiting.This is a softer MC read, I noticed one review compared it to Mills & Boon and I suppose it is a kind of Mills & Boon does MC and while I generally prefer a nice dark and gritty MC this made a change and overall I enjoyed it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29DM5LW20JEO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPDKAM4#wasThisHelpful","R29DM5LW20JEO6","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is actually the second book in this series and while I downloaded 'Rose' a while ago I've never actually got round to reading it, something about 'Lily' just drew me in and I started reading immediately.Lily has been in love with Daniel since she was twelve and she's nearly eighteen and therefore eligible to start dating. She needs to give a list of potential suitors to her aunt which she does but the list only contains one name, Daniel. The problem is even though Lily is in love with Daniel and admits he's the only man she'd ever consider marrying she believes he's still in love with her married sister Rose. Daniel was one of Rose's suitors for years before she married and Lily can't honestly believe that he could go from loving the feminine and ladylike Rose to loving her but she'll take him however she can.I really liked parts of this book and the sisters seem an interesting bunch and I'm considering continuing on and reading Amaryllis's book, even though this one drove me nuts in places.It was just too much, the constant 'he loves Rose not me' went on for far, far, far too long, I lost interest to the extent where I took a break and read another book, I thought Lily was never going to get it and I started to skim read just to get through it, never a good sign.##### SLIGHT SPOILER ######Not sure about the time line....they want to get married in December. Her mother suggests a Christmas themed wedding then says 'Are you thinking the beginning of the month or the end?'Yet one week later it's Christmas!Picky I know, I can't help it but that means the conversation took place one week before Christmas, the middle of December so how could they get married at the beginning?","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS3J9ZURB030J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMLQH8I#wasThisHelpful","RS3J9ZURB030J","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do love a good Mail Order romance and this one comes with an extra bit of spice.Annie Michealson left New York with her sixteen year old brother Beau, New York held no real future for them with nothing but factory jobs and she wanted more than that for him,Annie now finds herself stuck in Colter Canyon, Texas. Having left New York to become a Mail order bride, she arrived to discover her husband-to-be Eustace Fontaine was nothing like the man he'd pretended to be and Annie refuses to go ahead with the marriage.That was ten days ago and she's been living at the saloon ever since, she works at the bakery struggling to make enough money for her and Beau to travel further west but a single attractive girl living over a saloon collects attention and people make assumptions.And then there's Nick Kendal, he's tall, handsome and arrogant, the saloon girls flock to him but Annie's not sure how she feels about him, she can't deny he's attractive but he makes her nervous.I enjoyed this book as I said I do have a weakness for Mail Order brides and this one is slightly different.The 3.5 stars is not a negative and partly a reflection of the length after all it is only 57 pages long.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSBWGSB0RUWID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014VN8C0G#wasThisHelpful","RSBWGSB0RUWID","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book I've read by this author and even though I'd read the blurb and scanned the reviews it still wasn't what I expected but then I'm not really sure what I expected.I'll admit for a long while I was confused, I wasn't sure exactly what was going on, oh I had the basics but it was the details and how all the pieces fit together that eluded me, and that's the point, we get hooked in and need to know what happened, we slowly get the answers and sometimes the questions as we continue reading.Maya Petrov is just sixteen, beaten, bleeding and strapped to a chair blindfolded when she hears her father's voice:""I don't care if you have to wipe her entire damn memory, just make her forget. I pay you to make people forget.""""She is a liability, make it go away or she dies.""So we know her father's not exactly father of the year material but the more we read the more we realise just how truly depraved he is.It's hard not to love both the main characters, they've been through so much and both suffered their own hell, Nikolai more so, he's brilliant but tortured, not only by his own decisions and actions but his family and their history.I totally lost myself in this book and while it's a standalone I did wish several times that I'd read the 'Elite' series and therefore had some background on some of the Italians.This is very close to a 5 star read for me the only thing that I didn't like was Nikolai's family history it just seemed a bit too much, but this is a small point and the book is well worth a try don't be surprised if you're confused at the beginning everything is explained so stick with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25YNKTTIAURU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CU7PEA#wasThisHelpful","R25YNKTTIAURU1","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked the blurb but I couldn't find a review anywhere (I only found one review after I'd given up) so I put it to one side and decided to wait but I kept coming back to it and eventually I thought I'd just give it a go.I struggled at first because I didn't find Elizabeth particularly likeable, at all and then there's the writing English is obviously not the authors first language and the translation makes it difficult to read, it may seem picky but it doesn't flow and therefore makes reading slow and tedious, here's just a couple of examples but the book's littered with them.Of course! This is MY building and nothing happens here without my consent! Youre stealing me a time you cant imagine how much it costs. Your salary for life wouldnt come to so much.

"It's a long while since I last read a really good shifter book so after reading the blurb and reviews I thought I'd give this a try and it turned out to be an entertaining read.Damon Trahan is a Werewolf Guardian, all he wants is to do his job well and belong to a pack.He's on a mission when an urgent call comes through, a female werewolf has been kidnapped and he's to rescue her at all costs.Ava Renfroe is the female in question, she's been drugged and kidnapped and thinks she's hallucinating when she sees men change into wolves. She's twenty-four, has never shifted and has no idea she's a wolf.There's some great characters here, Damon, Ava, Jayden, Jeff but especially Granny she's hilarious.On the whole this is a good book, it's a bit abrupt in places and I got a little fed up of all the 'I'm not worthy' but there was only one part I really didn't understand and I'm putting it as a spoiler.######## SPOILER #######The wolves respect and revere women, they are precious and treated as such so why then when a queen finally appears:""The Were Laws state that when a Queen arises, she will be mated to the strongest Alpha in the Pack.""If you dont accept ????? as your mate, you will be put to death.""Thats murder.""Thats the law.Now this is just ridiculous one of the things I've always loved about werewolves is the way they treat their women they adore and protect them so the ideal that a rare queen would be murdered for not marrying who she's told is plain crazy.Am I being picky?Yes I suppose I am but why put that, it's not as if we were worried we all knew who Ava was going to end up with, we knew before we even started reading.While I'm moaning I can't understand why the General continued to withhold Ava's shift, was he going to do this indefinitely?","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NAQHGVENZ4C7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZM952G#wasThisHelpful","R3NAQHGVENZ4C7","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Mia still annoyed me in the beginning but this wore off as the book progressed, Korum again was, well what can I say I loved him. The new characters were great I'm hoping there's more of them in future books particularly Adam and Saret.The third and final book 'Close Remembrance' was also addictive, I won't give any details because I don't want to spoil anything for you but I loved this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFBF4HI4GYHBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXZANPW#wasThisHelpful","RFBF4HI4GYHBO","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start by saying this is not your typical romance or even a romance at all and if you start this book expecting one you will be sadly disappointed.I noticed a friend had marked this to read so I thought I'd check it out but after seeing all the reviews I decided not to bother, however my friend absolutely loved it and gave it 5 stars so I looked again.I wasn't sure exactly what to expect and it's a difficult book to categorise, Alasdair Kyriakous is an old, feared and powerful vampire and he finds himself inexplicably drawn to Leo Chapel, a human, he can't stay away he tries and fails and then he feeds from Leo....Strange things happen between Leo and Alasdair and neither one of them has any idea what's going on.This is a highly erotic read the tension builds and we're teased and tormented but surprisingly there's little actual sex but this works and works well.The story drives the book and it's an intriguing read but I missed the romance even though and I can't believe I'm saying this but the book worked better without it, doesn't mean I didn't want it or missed it but it's a stronger read without it, if that makes any sense at all.I liked the history of the vampires, even the brutality, which surprised me, and all the characters, I loved Alasdair and Leo plus the story which slowly reveals itself.So what didn't I like?The cliffhanger and this is a big one so now I'm left waiting for the next book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UAAO45PF7WHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122DD7HU#wasThisHelpful","R3UAAO45PF7WHO","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Apart from her temper tantrums she has a lot going for her, she's intelligent, loyal and capable of so much but every time she'd start to win me over she'd then throw another temper tantrum and I was back to disliking her again.I considered continuing on with 'Darkest Dawn' after all it's on KU and I loved all the council characters but I just don't think I can read another book full of Jessica so I'm passing for now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8668WIK9QU5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDGPD4W#wasThisHelpful","R8668WIK9QU5R","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ruby lives with her mother and step-dad Frank, she hasn't seen or heard from her brother Seth in over three years ever since he took off just after his eighteenth birthday, before he left Seth had been acting strange leaving their mother to assume it was drugs.Her best friend is Carly and she knows Ruby's secret, she's the only person that does, Ruby can read people's minds and possibly see things like images or memories.Ruby's life begins to unravel starting with Seth, she discovers he's coming to collect some stuff, he's not on drugs and he's written her letter after letter which their mother has confiscated leaving Ruby feeling forgotten and abandoned.This book has some interesting characters and it's funny and it has a great cover plus an interesting blurb but unfortunately that's not enough to safe it.I had lots of issues with this including the repeated use of the word 'encase'""So, basically don't speak to Micah or Seth encase I put my foot in it,""It had a lot of potential but it was painfully slow at times and ultimately failed to deliver.There were so many things which annoyed me and so many times I nearly gave up reading and with hindsight I should have.My main issue was Ruby, I hate stupid females, she took forever to put things together which I excused but then once we'd settled into the book she made stupid decision after stupid decision. You know when you're reading or watching tv and there's always the terrible, guaranteed to get you into trouble decision and you're thinking 'don't do that, whatever you do don't do that' well Ruby makes the bad choice every single time, I'm not exaggerating, every single time, her friend Aimee is arguably worse believe it or not.I knew this book was a first in series and suspected it would be a cliffhanger, which it is but there's no point reading this is you're not planning on continuing, it raises loads of questions but provides no answers.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ85MFU5SJEUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y19N5EY#wasThisHelpful","RJ85MFU5SJEUD","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From their very first appearance in The Last Riders books I've loved these Porter boys so I was excited about Tate's book.I love the craziness which surrounds these guys, the way they interact and the humour.Tate and Sutton fell in love one summer back when they were young, she stood by him when his parents died she helped and supported him and his siblings, he was her future.Then they were ripped apart, their futures no longer together and no longer happy and while they've both struggled Sutton truly suffered.I really enjoyed this book I wish it had been longer but after reading this I can't wait for Greer's book.In the interests of a totally honest review I have to admit I didn't like the cover and I was disappointed that Tate didn't realise what was happening at the time, ok I'll give him that but he didn't even realise later and then even after basically being told by someone he still has no idea.Now I'm waiting for Greer's, hopefully he's the next Porter brother although I'm hoping the next book released is Penni and Jackals it seems like I've been waiting forever for theirs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J9GYP0EV3IZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015Y80IGS#wasThisHelpful","R3J9GYP0EV3IZ3","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been with this series from the beginning I absolutely loved 'November' and most of others were really good, ok 'Lilly' and 'July' not so much.So I was really looking forward to this book, I mean it's Jax after all and yes I enjoyed it but, I know there's always a but...It was missing something, the characters are great, Hope was so cute I loved her but it's all getting a bit too similar. I know there's restrictions like the instalove, while I'm not normally a fan of this it's part of the story every Mayson has their 'one' and when they find them 'boom' the whole series is based around that so I can't complain. There's always the ex-girlfriends, a delusional one, a bitchy one or in this case one with a touch of both.We met Ellie in 'July' and we knew from the reaction of Jax she was his 'boom'This can easily be read as a standalone so don't worry if you haven't read 'July' just stick with it you'll be confused initially but things will be explained.I've said since 'November' that Auroras strength is in her characters and I haven't changed my mind while I appreciate the crime parts are good ways to introduce new people, like Ellie for example they never really work for me.This is a nice sweet read, nothing new, very similar to the rest but great characters plus a cute kid and puppies.One thing this book gave us was so much potential for future books, we're positively spoilt for choice and I while Sage's sounds good it's Ashlyn's book I can't wait for but June is next and I think hers might mix it up a bit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25VZU4IONR2QB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015EPMZ0I#wasThisHelpful","R25VZU4IONR2QB","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cami was born and raised in the Savage Disciples MC, it's in her blood and her heart but she lost her mother when she was only six years old and while at college she meets Nate and suddenly a new life is opened up for her. They become engaged but somewhere along the way friendly easy going Nate turns into the uptight and controlling Nathaniel and Cami becomes a shadow of the girl she one was. She's now Camille, drowning in beige, drinking and taking drugs just to cope with what her life has become.This was the part I struggled with at first I wasn't sure how I'd get along with someone who had willingly turned into a Stepford Wife and allowed herself to be told what to eat, listen to, wear etc and I can admit early on I kept reading mainly for Gauge who is smoking hot, but I'm getting ahead of myself.When her father Tank comes to visit Gauge comes along for the ride and the second he sees Cami he's lost, she's the woman he wants. As for Cami, in Gauge she sees a real man, no pretence, falseness or excuses and she can admit to herself that she wants him, badly.It turns out all Camille needed was something or in this case someone to make her realise how much she's gradually given up.I mentioned earlier that I struggled initially with Camille, at first glance she appears weak but it doesn't take long to discover her inner fire and once again she becomes Cami.There's so many MC books available at the moment and I try to read as many as I can, this comes out on the softer side and if you'd have asked me a while ago I would have said I preferred a darker, grittier read but now I'm not so sure since I really enjoyed this, I loved all the characters and the club and I can't wait for the next one 'Shift'Is this a 5 star read?

I used a f***ing taser on you and took you hostage. You watched me kill your ex.""Not exactly a romantic start and not the easiest foundation on which to build a new relationship.I'm not really sure what else to say, maybe I missed a lot because I skipped the first book but so many things didn't make sense to me at all. The main one being after what he did how is Jester still alive?

"This is a cute little shifter read which ticks all the boxes, hot domineering alpha, curvy female, humour, hot sexy scenes and of course a nasty female who wants him for herself.Ginger is down from New York putting 'as much physical distance as I can financially afford, between myself and that cheating, lying, useless pig of an ex-boyfriend of mine. Not that I'm bitter.'And while the Sheriff is the hottest thing she's ever seen, he's got muscles on top of muscles and has women dripping all over him after her breakup Ginger is lacking in confidence and all these women are so slim and beautiful that when he commands her to dance with him she refuses.Expecting it to have blown over by morning Ginger is amazed to discover that everyone knows about it, Winifred has a theory 'Social experiments have determined that in smaller communities, this type of salacious news travels in a manner similar to a contagious virus, only faster.'Well that and it was in the morning paper.To make amends and to keep the peace between the packs Ginger is made to apologise and is given the job of Sheriffs assistant for the next two weeks.This is an entertaining funny shifter read, well worth a try if you want to escape for a while.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT03IWZG8S5FV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDCR48M#wasThisHelpful","RT03IWZG8S5FV","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Maybe that's just me.- It made no sense that Satan didn't just pull the trigger, it would have only taken seconds and not held him up.- And seriously why wouldn't Eve lock her door if she going to get naked on her bed in a clubhouse full of bikers- Satan provides them with footage of him and his boys torturing and then killing Lola they then dump her dead body outside the clubhouse....isn't that enough to have him put away? I can't understand why they would go to all the time and trouble of setting him up on drugs charges when they've got proof he committed murder. Is it just me because it doesn't make any sense at all.- 'I feel bad about giving Angel that sedative now. I hoped tonight he'd have told me how he felt about me' again is it me....seriously Eve wants Angel to tell her he cares Angel is desperate to tell her he cares so she sedates him. Then next morning she's unhappy because 'He didn't say anything last night' that's cos you sedated him before he had a chance.- This is just the main points the list is actually quite long.I knew before starting that this was part 1 of 2 and as it reached the end it was obvious how it would finish and again##### BIG SPOILER #####When Angel wakes from his sedation and gets to the airport -  ""I'm sorry sir, that flight has just departed"" She gives me an odd look.

"If I'm being honest I don't think I actually intended to read this book, after being disappointed with 'Hatred' I waited for the reviews to come out on 'Temptation' and they were very mixed so I'd more or less decided to give up on this series but lately I've been re-reading a lot of my old favourites which included 'Honor' and 'Duty' and I'd forgotten just how good these books are so having decided to continue on I skimmed 'Hatred' to get me up to date.Firstly I have to say I liked all the characters in this book, even Gianna who annoyed me in 'Hatred' her personality works surprisingly well as a secondary character, I love Luca, Aria and of course Matteo.If I liked all the players then what went wrong, frankly I'm not really sure but it was missing something it felt a bit drawn out and dare I say boring in places, there wasn't enough story and the relationship unfortunately didn't carry it for me.This said I'm glad I read it as I enjoyed keeping up with the other characters and while parts of this book were slow it picked up towards the end and finished really well.So yes I will be reading 'Vengeance' when it's out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H2RSSQXJY8YP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRLKJOC#wasThisHelpful","R2H2RSSQXJY8YP","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This series was a bit of a surprise to me, far better than I expected and while I'm not personally a fan of short serial books, if I see what I think is going to be good I wait until all parts are available and read them as one, it also helps if like this one they're on KU.This book is where all the planning and hard work come together as Mark and Sophie try to clean up the city. There's a lot to do and most of it is dangerous but Mark is atoning for his past sins by trying to balance the scales a bit.As with the other books this has some hot scenes, the love between Mark and Sophie is obvious and the core of the book.This is a good conclusion to this series and I'm so glad that Tabby is getting her own book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RILGCRX8KQ9PZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014O5A3MG#wasThisHelpful","RILGCRX8KQ9PZ","A1X87IHRK15RBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X87IHRK15RBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"New York 1901 is a worker placement game set in the world of construction and skyscrapers at the turn of the century.  On their turns, players can draw a colored card that matches lots on the board, players can then build buildings with Tetris-like shapes.  As the game progresses, players can demolish their existing buildings and build the next generation of buildings.  Each time a building is built, points are scored.  Eventually, players can build an epic skyscraper for an epic amount of points.  Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.  The game that New York 1901 reminds me of most of all is Ticket to Ride.  It's a fairly light, accessible game that nevertheless offers a healthy dose of strategy and fun.  This is the kind of game you pull out for your friends who aren't really into niche gaming in order to introduce them into the hobby, and its a game that you and your niche-gamer friends will want to pull out every once in a while for a great gaming experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15VPCU2OE1D5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IP3LEW#wasThisHelpful","R15VPCU2OE1D5J","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not a big fan of wrestling.  It's just not my thing, though I have many friends who enjoy it.  I am, however, a huge fan of Gale Force Nine, which created such amazing board games as Firefly: The Game, Sons of Anarchy: Men of Mayhem, and Homeland: The Game.  With such an outstanding track record, I though I'd give WWE Superstar Showdown a chance.First of all, three stars does not mean I think it's a bad game.  There is a lot I like about this game.  Like Gale Force Nine's other games, this one is super-thematic, and really captures (as much as a board game can) the feel of professional wrestling.  There are different scenarios that players can choose from to mix things up, and in a two player game each player selects one of the wrestlers- both his figure and his unique deck of cards.  Players place three tactic cards before them, and they reveal each once simultaneously, then compare the results.  There is a rock, paper, scissors mechanic to the combat, (grapple beats strike, strike beats maneuver, maneuver beats grapple, slam beats everything), and the winner of each card contest can take the actions on the card like movement, power, or setup.  The loser must surrender cards equal to the winner's power card (plus any setup from the previous card), unless he played a block card.  Once a player can no longer play cards because his deck has been depleted, he is out.  There are also many other thematic elements to the game, like pinning an opponent, throwing an opponent out of a ring, and more.Despite some generally fun play, the game never really captured my imagination.  Part of that is because of the theme (again, I'm not one much for professional wrestling), but also because the ""rock, paper, scissors"" mechanic got old fast, and meant that any pre-planned strategy went right out the window as soon as combat began, (see ""Fury of Dracula: Third Edition"" for a rock, paper, scissors combat mechanic that works really well).  There are fun choices in the game, but in the end it felt too random.  Fans of professional wrestling, I suspect, will really enjoy this offering from Gale Force Nine, but it just left me a little flat.  If a friend suggested playing this I would, and I'd probably have fun, but it's not a game I think I'll ever be suggesting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5UCKAL7GO5Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0P2W3S#wasThisHelpful","R5UCKAL7GO5Z2","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fury of Dracula, 2nd Edition, was one of my favorite games of all time.  As a serious gamer and Youtuber, I recently completed my top 100 games of all time, and Fury of Dracula came in 3rd place.  It's a tense chase across Europe as four vampire hunters attempt to corner and defeat the evil Count Dracula before he can create an army of the undead.  I bought my copy from Amazon a few months before it went out of print in 2012- and I was so glad I did.  For the past few years there has been a renewed interest in the game, particularly by those who had never had a chance to play it before.  Many called upon Fantasy Flight Games to reprint the game, but the company remained silent on the issue.  That is until a few months ago when Fantasy Flight Games announced a brand new third edition that promised streamlined play and easier to learn rules.I was a little reluctant when I heard that Fantasy Flight Games was planning on streamlining this game.  I loved so much about it, that how could they possibly make it better.  The more I thought about it, however, the more I realized that the game did have some clunky rules, and perhaps a new edition could indeed simplify a few game concepts.For those of you new to the game, Fury of Dracula is a contest for 2-5 players.  One player takes on the role of the evil Count Dracula, and the others take on the roles of the vampire hunters form Bram Stoker's historic novel- Abraham van Helsing, Mina Harker, Dr. Seward, & Lord Godalming.  The hunters begin in various cities around Europe, each connected to other cities by road and rail lines, then Dracula can choose his secret starting location.  As opposed to the second edition, in this edition the hunters a daytime action and a nighttime action.  Hunters can only move between cities during the day.  They can move once per road, or by reserving a train ticket (another action) they can potentially move up to three spaces by rail by drawing a random ticket token.  (This is different from the second edition, where players had to roll a dice to determine rail movement, and could be quite frustrated when they were ""detained over papers""- losing a turn).  If players enter a location where Dracula has been, Dracula must reveal the card from his trail.  Players can attempt to resupply while in a big city by drawing an item card, then drawing an event card.  If they resupply during the day, they can draw the event card from the top of the deck- if it's a Dracula event card they can discard it- but at night they must draw from the bottom of the deck, and if it is a Dracula event card they must give it to Dracula.After both the hunter day and night action, Dracula can move.  He secretly selects a location card from his deck and places it on the board.  Previous location cards slide to the right.  Unlike the second edition, where Dracula used cardboard encounter tokens from a pool, here Dracula has an encounter deck, from which he draws cards to lay down upon his location cards in order to set traps for the hunters, and in order to mature his vampires.  Combat is also streamlined in this version.  Where in the second edition players would roll dice and then play cards to resolve the winner's and loser's effects, here players both just play cards simultaneously.  These cards represent tactics available to Dracula and the hunters.  Typically, there are six rounds of combat unless someone escapes first.  There is a real ""rock, scissors, paper"" feel to combat, but it can be incredibly intense, and surprisingly I liked it a lot better than combat in the second edition.Finally, Dracula's victory conditions have changed somewhat.  In the second edition, Dracula had a vampire track that went up to six.  If Dracula matured vampires the track advanced, or if he knocked out a hunter it advanced.  The game could take a surprisingly long time to get to six, and this game could potentially go on for 8 hours or more (though that was uncommon).  Now, Dracula has an ""Influence Track"" that runs to 13- his victory condition, and he can gain influence by maturing vampires and knocking out hunters, but in another important way as well.  In the middle of the time tracker is a sun face.  After each game ""week"" a evil third to this face is added.  After three game ""weeks"" the evil face is completed, and despair among the hunters takes hold.  Each turn thereafter leads to Dracula's marker advancing by three along the influence track.  This adds an important timer to the game which can keep it from going too long.  It is still at least a 2-3 hour game, and can go longer depending upon the players' analysis paralysis problems, but the game just seems to move quicker than its predecessor.All told, this is a brilliant new edition of a wonderful board game.  Fury of Dracula is one of those games that serious gamers can really sink their teeth into (pun intended), and offers some really great board game experiences.  Many games will come down to the wire, (a game I played on Halloween came down to Dracula with just one health point left, and he was able to escape just as his influence track hit 13), and you and your friends will be laughing throughout.  I'm a little disappointed with the aesthetic here.  I do prefer the artwork on the cards, the board, the box, and the overall visual presentation of the second edition, but as far as game play goes, Fury of Dracula third edition is the winner hands down.  I'm really excited that with this new edition more and more gamers will have the opportunity to enjoy this great game!  I cannot recommend it enough.Review copy provided.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QX9JSYU9KNJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013INMYBI#wasThisHelpful","R3QX9JSYU9KNJQ","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This food dehydrator is a pretty smart looking package.  Digital displays, metal trays, and relatively light weight.  The instruction manual, however, is not as clear as I would have liked, and frankly, I'm still confused about how exactly it is supposed to operate.  I recently tried to make some banana chips and made a hash of it.  The manual talks about the two different settings, yet offers little explanation of just what they do and why they are different.  That was nothing, however, compared to actually trying to set the thing.  The manual stated that you needed to put it in raw mode, so I pressed the button to set it, but it kept moving back and forth between that mode and the other, and would not let me just set it for raw.  Am I missing something?

"Osprey Games' They Come Unseen is a game a hidden movement set in the Cold War.  While it plays up to five players, it works best with two or four.  One player (or team) takes on the role of two NATO submarines in the Barents Sea, while the other player commands two Soviet destroyers, and three logistic ships.  The subs and the destroyers each have player boards, which feature dials to track battery and depth for the subs, and fuel and salvos for the Soviets.  The NATO player has access not only to the main board, but also to a smaller board hidden behind a large player screen.  Whenever the NATO player submerges one of his subs, he puts it on the hidden board so that he can keep track of it while the Soviet player searches for him.At the beginning of the game the NATO player selects four random cards that feature Soviet bases- these are his targets.  Since there are six total bases, most of them will be targets, but the Soviet player has no idea which ones to defend and which ones are red herrings.  The NATO player then moves his subs- every point of movement wears down his battery power- and he may surface to recharge his batteries, surface in a Soviet base to destroy it, or lay mines on the hidden board, (the NATO players only form of attack).  The Soviet player then moves his destroyers, which costs fuel points, then they can drop a sonar net to try to locate the subs.  Two clear tiles are laid down with colored webs.  If a sub is beneath one of the colors, he must call out ""Contact Yellow"" or whatever the color is.  The Destroyer can then launch his salvos, trying to guess the exact spot and depth of the sub.  He must pick the correct spot, but if he's close on depth he can still wound the sub.  If he is exactly correct, the sub takes a hit.  If the sub is hit three times, it is knocked out of the game.  The Soviet player can also move his logistical ships which carry ammo and fuel from one base to another, and one of the ships can resupply the destroyers at sea.  If a sub destroys a base all the fuel and ammo in it are destroyed.  Since ammo and fuel are limited, you will want to use the logistical ships to distribute these resources.Weather also plays a factor as storms move over the board and affect the players' ability to move and take actions.  If the NATO player successfully destroys all of his objectives, he wins the game.  If the Soviet player sinks both subs, he wins the game.They Come Unseen has some problems.  Its components- specifically the ship counters- are a little weak.  The game would have benefited from plastic minis.  The problem is, virtually all of the Soviet ships look alike.  Second, the rulebook is not easy to follow, and can be downright confusing in some areas.  The rules refer to ""surface"" and ""periscope depth"" interchangeably, without any explanation that they are the same thing.  If you don't know that they are the same, you might get confused.  Also, it would be nice if the player boards could more easily track information, since Soviets can move, take an action, then move again.  There are a few other little fiddly things that it would be nice if there was a way track, but its not here.Criticism aside, They Come Unseen is a very fun game.  It's a game of hidden movement not unlike Fury of Dracula or Letters From Whitechapel (though those two games are superior, in my opinion).  What is cool here is the cold war theme that really comes through in gameplay.  Each move, players are desperate to stay hidden or locate their prey.  Games typically last about 90-120 minutes, and they usually come down to the wire.  I've had some really intense games where it came down to the last few moves to decide the winner.  If you like tight contests and tense, hidden movement mechanics, you may want to check out They Come Unseen.  I'm only rating this game with three stars, because of the above criticism, but that does not mean that this is a bad game by any means, merely that I think the presentation could have been better.  I have no doubt that for the right kind of gamer They Come Unseen will scratch an itch!Review Copy Provided","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MTPOVERNK8ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1472813960#wasThisHelpful","R2MTPOVERNK8ER","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Hernfar Guardians army pack expansion for Battlelore, 2nd Edition, from Fantasy Flight Games, expands the Daqan faction and brings some fun new extras this great game.  First, there are new units such as the Battlemages, the Ironclad, and the large Siege Golem.  Each has their own new and unique abilities.  This pack also comes with the Crystal Spire terrain tile.  When units start their activation on this tile they gain one additional dice during combat.  There is also rules for shielding, which allow some units to essentially absorb a hit before suffering damage.  A new lore deck is included as well, which can be used instead of the deck from the base game.  New scenarios are also provided.Lovers of Battlelore, 2nd Edition will have a field day with this fun new army pack, which provides many new options for the game.  It seemed as though Fantasy Flight Games was not going to support Battlelore, considering that the base game came out in late 2013.  It's really good to see that this game is still on their radar.

"Fauna is a game in which players attempt to bet on where animals are found around the world, as well as animals' other characteristics.  An animal card is shown and players then place markers on a geographic location somewhere on the world map.  Players score points for correctly guessing where the animal is located, or if they placed a marker adjacent to the region.  Players can also bet on things like the animals' weight, length, and tail length.  Several rounds are played and once one player reaches a certain score based on the number of players, he or she wins.Fauna is a generally fun educational game, that children should really take to.  Adults will be less impressed.  It almost seems that it would be easier if players simply guessed aloud the info, then revealed the cards. It really is a rather simple game.  Still, people are likely to learn a thing or two about nature and geography with this game.  Another complaint- as a member of the Amazon Vine program I received a review copy of this game.  Usually vine review copies are new.  This game, however, was pretty beaten up.  The box was weathered and had a ""demo"" sticker pasted on it, and the board itself looked as though it has seen some mileage.  This is curious because all of the animal cards were still wrapped in plastic.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18A2OM5VWH1IE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P6V2G6#wasThisHelpful","R18A2OM5VWH1IE","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Forbidden Stars is Fantasy Flight Games' latest title set in the grim Warhammer 40K universe.  In this grand strategic wargame, which plays in about 2-3 hours, two to four players take on different factions like the Ultramarines- enhanced humans who fight for their corpse emperor; Orks, brutal space pillagers; the Eldar, a species with advanced technology and psychic abilities; and the Chaos Space Marines, evil humans corrupted by the warp.  Each faction has its own faction cards, combat deck, event deck, and upgrade deck, as well as mountains of plastic spaceships and land forces.  The board itself is made up of tiles ""systems"", depending upon the number of players.  Each system contains worlds and voids- spaces for land forces and spaceships.  Scattered throughout the systems are each factions objective tokens, forcing conflict as players attempt to gain their tokens.The game plays out in a series of up to eight rounds, each round containing three phases.  The first phase is planning.  Players each place four command tokens on systems where they have units or adjacent systems.  During the next phase, player take turns resolving the tokens they have placed.  Since tokens are stacked in each system, players must plan carefully.  Only the topmost token in a system can be activated, and if a player has no tokens on top of a system he must wait until one is next before he can resolve it.  The command tokens allow players to deploy, essentially allowing them to build units and structures (factories, cities, and citadels); the dominate token allows players to exploit the resources of their worlds and gain special tokens that can help in building and combat; the strategy token allows players to upgrade their combat decks or gain upgrade cards, giving them special advantages; and the advance token can be used to move units from one system to another, or move units within systems.  In order to move players must have a chain of land units and spaceships from point of departure to point of arrival.When one or more units enter a world or void where an opponents units exist, combat ensues.  Both players total up the amount of dice they roll based on their units.  The dice can roll a gun symbol, your attack power; a shield symbol, your defense value; and wings, your morale.  After drawing five cards from your combat deck, each player then selects one card to play- first the attacker plays and resolves, then the defender.  Assuming one side isn't wiped out, combat goes three rounds.  At the end of three rounds, if neither side is completely eliminated, morale is used to decide the battle.  Other factors can be included in combat as well, such as reinforcement tokens.The game lasts until one player has captured objective tokens equal to the number of players, at which point he or she wins the game.  Alternatively, if no one has fulfilled this condition, the game ends after eight rounds and whoever has the most objective tokens wins.  The are a few more rules here like warp storm movement and event cards, but that is the gist of it.Forbidden Stars is a game that Warhammer 40K has been calling for.  It is an Axis & Allies-type strategic adventure game that is deeply thematic and offers more than just dice-chucking battle after dice-chucking battle.  Each faction plays very differently, with their units and abilities, and makes for some fun asymmetrical encounters.  What is really great about this game is that it doesn't allow players to turtle.  If you want to win, you have to attack.  Players who just sit there building up units will definitely lose.  In that sense the game is deeply thematic as well as fun and engaging.  The Warhammer universe is all about war, and the game really reflects that.  Combat is fun and engaging, as players must constantly make choices about their cards and how best to mitigate their dice rolls.  Also really fun is the way in which players can customize their decks, building them up for later advantage.  It's a fun deck building aspect that really adds a lot to the game and a mechanic that one would not expect from this big box light wargame.The game, of course, is a beautiful production for start to finish.  The artwork, the cards, the tokens, the minis, the board- it's all first rate.  Once again Fantasy Flight Games has demonstrated why they are a leader in board game design and execution.  This game follows in the footsteps of other great Fantasy Flight Games productions like Twilight Imperium, Battlestar Galactica, Star Wars: Armada, and Star Wars: Imperial Assault.  Top notch components all the way.My only significant complaint with the game has to do with combat.  Combat, while fun for players engaged in it, can take a while.  In 3-4 player games this means a lot of sitting around.  A lot of games have downtime, but this is a game that keeps all players fairly engaged throughout- except when other players are in combat.  This is too bad, and perhaps this is something that the inevitable expansions will address down the line.  Still, this is a relatively minor complaint compared with everything that this game gets right.All told, Fantasy Flight Games'  Forbidden Stars is another fantastic board game that will keep you and your friends riveted throughout.  It's just a lot of fun!Review copy provided.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T0XV1ZRWDU66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616617772#wasThisHelpful","R2T0XV1ZRWDU66","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Salt of the Earth"" is a wonderful documentary about an extraordinary photographer and amazing human being.  Wim Wenders co-directs this film about Sebastiao Salgado, a man who studied economics, but ended up traveling the world in search of the human condition through his art.  The film chronicles Salgado's projects to photograph the peoples of Central and South America, the genocides in Africa, the firefighters putting out Kuwaiti oil fires in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War, the world's workers, the natural world, and more.  The film also documents the successful efforts of Salgado and his wife to replant the rainforests of their home in Brazil.Wenders portrays Salgado as a real-life Indiana Jones adventurer.  The treasure Salgado finds, however, is the rich experience of humanity and the planet Earth.  The film never strays too strongly into politics, though it's easy to see what Salgado's views are on a myriad of topics.  Regardless of your own political standpoint, you can't help but be moved by the man's adventure, and, more importantly, his photographs.  ""The Salt of the Earth"" is simply a remarkable film that features Salgado's beautiful, haunting images throughout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RET0OFTK0RIQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVJ3MOS#wasThisHelpful","RET0OFTK0RIQD","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heir to the Jedi is an adequate Star Wars novel, hitting most of the right notes yet still falling flat a lot of the time.  The story takes place after the events of A New Hope, but before The Empire Strikes Back.  Fresh from his victory at Yavin, young Luke Skywalker is sent by Admiral Ackbar on a mission to open up new supply channels to the Rebel Alliance.  He soon finds himself hooking up with the beautiful daughter of a galactic industrialist with her own grudge against the Empire.  Eventually, the two are assigned to help an alien cryptographer defect from the Empire to the Alliance, and soon have Imperial agents hot on their trail.The book has some clever moments and tense scenes as Luke and his allies face off against the empire, pirates, and deadly alien creatures.  It's fun to see Luke's naive optimism, believing that his father was a great man, struck down by the evil Darth Vader.  The book also offers some decently drawn characters that add to the narrative.  The problem with Heir to the Jedi is that it never really feels that engaging.  Part of that is due to the fact that you know where it is heading ultimately, not only in terms of Luke's overall story arc within the saga, but also within the book itself.  There are not a lot of surprises, and it's easy to spot who will live and who won't make it.Heir to the Jedi is a good Star Wars novel, it's just not a great one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWLMNEML6BXR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345544854#wasThisHelpful","RWLMNEML6BXR8","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"X-Men: Mutant Revolution, from WizKids, is a re-theming of Gale Fore Nine's game Spartacus.  In X-Men, 3-4 players take on the role of a mutant school, each with its own unique vision for mutants, and is headed by either Storm, Cyclops, Wolverine, or Magneto.  A game round takes place over a series of phases where players bid ""hope coins,"" the game's currency, to buy new heroes and students for each school.  There is also a plot phase where player can team up to play cards against other players or work together for mutual benefit.  The final phase is the mission phase, where players set their character tokens out on the board and battle each other, or attempt to overcome some unique objective.  When players' characters are placed on the board, three dice are placed on the board as well, and turned to the character's stats- attack, defense, and movement.  The numbers indicated how many dice are rolled for attack and defense, and when players engage in combat they compare their rolls, from highest to lowest, creating a ""dice string.""  When characters take hits they must lower their dice stats.  The player that wins the mission gets a reward.  The goal of the game is to be the first to gain six revolution points.X-Men: Mutant Revolution is a pretty good game, though there are a few criticisms.  First of all the game is too long.  It would be better if it was a 1- 1.5 hour game, instead of a 2+ hour game.  The ""teams"" players build rarely feel like a team, as players only field one hero or student during missions.  Additionally, the game can come across as a little fiddly with all the steps each round.  Having said all of that, this game is fun.  Players use bidding dials to bid for characters and to become the mission leader, that resemble the dials from Star Trek: Attack Wing.  The Bidding can get quite intense.  The ""take that"" element during the plot phase is a lot of fun, too, as a players' best laid plans can go up in smoke if players band together against him.  There is a real negotiation mechanic going on here that is a always welcome in games- and it may be the most engaging part of X-Men: Mutant Revolution.  Also, while some of the missions are so-so, some of them are really cool.  The combat between players, when it takes place, is a whole lot of fun.In summation, while the game does have some drawbacks, it is generally a fun and engaging game that players will really enjoy.  Fans of X-Men comics and books will have a field day as their favorite characters come to live on the board and with the cards.  If you like X-Men, you'll definitely wand to check this one out.Review copy provided.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFSYU21EOC3RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIVKJE4#wasThisHelpful","RFSYU21EOC3RL","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""Star Wars: Lords of the Sith"", author Paul S. Kemp has written a engaging and generally enjoyable adventure story.  The books centers around events on the world of Ryloth, home of the Twi'leks, several years after the events in ""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.""  Dreaming of a Ryloth free from the empire's yoke, several Twi'lek freedom fighters learn that Emperor Palpatine and his minion Darth Vader will soon visit their world.  They then prepare for a daring plan to assassinate the two agents of evil.  Soon, Vader and Palpatine find themselves alone in the forests of Ryloth.  Battling horrendous monsters, Imperial officers with their own agendas, and the freedom fighters themselves, The Emperor and Vader must use all of their cunning to survive.  But just as importantly, can one Sith ever truly trust another?While ""Star Wars: Lords of the Sith"" is a good Star Wars title featuring the Emperor and Vader, it never quite lives up to thrilling adventure and intrigue of books like ""Star Wars: Tarkin"" or ""Star Wars: Darth Plagueis.""  Those two books were brilliant explorations of the dark side's greatest champions that meshed brilliantly with the wider Space Opera of the franchise.  ""Lords of the Sith"" offers some of this, but the story just feels much smaller.  Rather than a sweeping galactic adventure with grand political overtones, Kemp's book is more intimate, focusing perhaps too much on the Twi'leks and the politics of Ryloth than on the Emperor and Vader.  Still, the book is fun and fans should really enjoy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGQYQB8BOJ5Q7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345511441#wasThisHelpful","RGQYQB8BOJ5Q7","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having never played XCOM the video game, I didn't know what to expect from XCOM The Board Game.  Knowing that Fantasy Flight Games was behind it, however, made picking up this game a no brainer.  In XCOM The Board Game one to four players take on specific roles in order to fight an alien invasion of Earth.  One player plays the Commander, who must keep track of the budget, deploy interceptor aircraft to fight UFOs, and choose which Crisis card the team will have to deal with.  The Chief Scientist must choose which tech to research and how many resources will be devoted to each research.  The Squad Leader will be responsible for selecting missions, deploying four different types of soldiers to accomplish the missions, and deploying soldiers to defend XCOM's headquarters.  The Central Officer is in charge in satellites, which are used to combat UFOs in orbit.  All players have starter cards and can gain techs which allow them to use special abilities to help to the team.  Everything the team deploys, from interceptors, to soldiers, to scientists, to satellites, must be paid for out of the budget, and so players must constantly negotiate with the rest of the team for everything they want to do.The Central Officer has another major responsibility in this game- managing an app on a tablet, cell phone, or laptop (which is downloadable for free from FFG).  The game plays out in two phases- a timed phase and a resolution phase.  During the timed phase, the app tells the Central Officer what action can be taken by which player, and gives them a strict time limit to accomplish their task.  The tasks may be: research tech in a specific slot, an alien invades the HQ, interceptors must be deployed, UFOs appear over continents or in orbit, a new mission must selected, and more.  The Central Officer must relay all of this information as quickly as possible to the other players, and make sure they are not taking too long.  During the resolution phase, players then resolve all of the tasks that they set in motion in the timed phase.  Players roll dice in order to get success for tech, knocking down UFOs, killing aliens in the base, and more.  Players roll XCOM D6 dice, which features two success symbols on, as well as a numbered D8, which functions for the alien enemy.  When you fail a dice roll, you can roll again, but it becomes increasingly likely that you will be defeated because with each non-success you move the threat marker up one space (from 1 to 5).  If the D8 is equal to or lower than the threat marker, it is a fail and you lose the scientists, interceptors, soldiers, satellites, etc...  If, at the end of the resolution phase, there are UFOs left over continents, that continent is moved forward on the panic track (if two nations make it to the orange section of the panic track- the players lose the game).  If there are any aliens left over in the base, the base damage marker moves forward (if ever this marker reaches the end- the players lose the game- and there are also other negative consequences for it hitting red points).  Players are working toward being able to complete the ""Final Mission"" and the app will tell you when you are able to do this (based on completing other missions and other criteria).  Once the Final Mission is completed successfully, the players win the game.XCOM the Board Game is a thrilling adventure that offers a fun yet stressful timed component.  Not all of the decisions in the game are in the timed phase, so players won't be stressed out too much (like in, say, Space Alert or Damage Report).  Rather, decisions of significance are equally divided between the timed phase and the resolution phase.  The app is really fun and adds a lot to the game, without it being gimicky.  It draws players into the high tech feel of the game, while at the same time giving players just enough time to negotiate with other players about how much money can be spent on each task, and then making those decisions.  Essentially, what you do during the timed phase is really about setting you up for the resolution phase, getting yourselves into the best position to deal with the multiple crises the game presents.  The dice rolling during the resolution phase adds a push-your-luck mechanic that may cost the team, but the potential rewards are just too much to ignore.All told, XCOM The Board Game succeeds brilliantly in creating a tense, engaging, and incredibly fun experience.  Each player will get sucked into their role, and the unique game challenge that that presents.  At the same time, all players know they have to work together or suffer catastrophic defeat.  Fun, inventive game play, really well designed cooperative mechanics, and a great theme make XCOM The Board Game a winner!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DDH346HOQSQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616619686#wasThisHelpful","R2DDH346HOQSQ3","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Murano, from Mayfair Games, is a fun mid-level eurogame that takes place in Venice.  Two to four players work to gain the most victory points by manipulating gondolas around the board, building buildings by placing tiles on islands, and various other actions.  On a player's turn he or she may move a gondola along the track around the board, but must stop before entering a space with another gondola.  Whatever space the gondola lands allows players to take a specific action- from collecting building tiles, building buildings and roads, producing glass in factories, selling goods to customers, and more.  Also, an important action is drawing character cards and placing gondoliers on the islands.  At the end of the game, if certain conditions on an island have been met for held character cards, and the player has a gondolier on that island, he or she may spend that gondolier to capitalize on the character card.  Whoever has the most victory points at the end of the game wins.The above, of course, is just the bare bones of the rules for Murano, and there really is a lot more to it than that.  The game is very interesting as it really forces players to decide which gondolas to move in order to do the actions that are required for victory.  Players' strategies must evolve over the course of the game as new character cards are drawn and considered, and players will end up fighting over resources and islands.  Though the game initially looks rather intimidating, it is actually a very fun and relatively quick light to medium level eurogame.  This is a perfect game for families and those who prefer indirect conflict in their board games.  Very fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V7J31IRC3EA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q1FKDEG#wasThisHelpful","R2V7J31IRC3EA8","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dead of Winter, from Plaid Hat Games, is a semi-cooperative board game with a hidden traitor element.  The game takes place in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, as survivors have made a haven for themselves at a place called simply The Colony.  There, plagued by shortages and fighting the bitter winter cold, they hope to make their stand.  In addition to The Colony board, several location cards are set out, featuring places like the Gas Station, the Hospital, the School, and more.  Players choose, either together or randomly, a scenario and place it in the appropriate spot on The Colony board.  Each scenario features a group victory condition that all players must complete in order to win.  The Colony board also features a round track and a morale track, with each scenario noting the starting space on each track.  If ever either track gets down to zero, the players lose.  Also, each player is given his or her own objective cards.  Essentially, each player must complete his or her specific objectives as well as the scenario's objective if they are to win the game.  Players must help each other to complete the main objective, but must also work secretly to complete their own private objective.  As though this was devious enough, one of the players may receive a Betrayal card, making them a secret traitor who works against The Colony's interests in order to win.At the beginning of the first player's turn he or she must resolve a Crisis card, some unique problem that players must all contribute cards to in order to beat it by the end of the round.  If they do not beat the Crisis, something bad will happen to The Colony, most likely a loss of morale.  Then, players take their individual turns.  All players having rolled dice at the beginning of the round players can spend their dice rolls to take certain actions like killing zombies, searching for equipment at locations, or taking out the trash (seriously- an important part of the game).  Players can also take actions without spending dice like moving to locations, trading cards with other players, playing cards, and more.  Whenever a player moves to a location or kills a zombie, however, they most roll the exposure dice, which will either wound them, frostbite them (which makes them progressively sicker), or zombie bite them, which will kill them and spread the infection.Also, at the beginning of each players' turn, the player to the right will draw a Crossroads card and read the top part secretly.  If conditions on the board match conditions on the card, the rest of the card is read, providing a new narrative element and leading to a decision.  The active player can choose between two options- something good with a cost- or all the players may be required to vote on the question.  The game ends if either track hits zero, or if the scenario objective is met.  Each player checks to see if he or she has met their own secret conditions to determine winners.Dead of Winter is a fantastic game that is incredibly innovative on a lot of levels.  First of all the whole dynamic between completing the individual objectives and the scenario objectives is a lot of fun.  Players do not know if other players are acting in their own interests or in the good of the whole.  Additionally, with the possibility of one player being a traitor, the game really succeeds in creating an air of paranoia, perhaps better than any board game since Battlestar Galactica.  Where the game really shines, however, is in the Crossroads system.  The idea that on any player's turn a dynamic new narrative element appears requiring a tough choice is just fantastic, and really takes Dead of Winter from being a good game to being a great game.A game that revels in tough choices, fun narrative play, an eerie theme, and paranoia so thick you can choke on it, Dead of Winter is easily one of 2014's best games and a wonderful tabletop experience.  You will want to check this one out for sure!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A27LQDX2AWQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFKITJC#wasThisHelpful","R3A27LQDX2AWQ8","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Argent: The Consortium, from Level 99 Games, is a worker placement game in which players vie to become the new chancellor of a magical university.  Essentially, players must learn who is voting for the new chancellor, and then adopt strategies to get their vote.

These voter cards are placed face down.  On a player's turn, he or she may take actions to gain those items and tokens, or look under the voter cards to determine who is voting for what.  A worker placement game, players place their figures on spaces in rooms throughout the university, and each space allows players to take special actions.  The order in which figures are placed in the rooms can have an impact as well, allowing for more or less abilities.  Players each have factions that offer individual strengths and abilities, and each player has different colored figures that can perform different actions even as they perform the action of the room they are on.  When the game ends players reveal the voter cards and see who the voters elect the new chancellor.  There is A LOT more to it than that, but this is just a basic overview of the rules for Argent: The Consortium.First of all, Argent: The Consortium is a huge game.  Make sure you have a ton of space to play on, because you'll have university tiles, player boards, bell tower cards, spell cards, item cards, and more all over the board.  Seriously, this may be the largest game in terms of sheer playing space that I have ever played- and I've played Arkham Horror with expansions and Firefly: The Game!  Game play itself is a lot of fun, as players are bombarded with options and potential strategies.  There is really a ton of things that you can do in this game, and a ton of things that can happen to you.  In this sense, Argent: The Consortium's strength is also its biggest weakness.  Players who suffer from analysis paralysis will really suffer in this game (as will those who play with them- waiting for their turn), and even seasoned players will agonize over the best path to victory.  Still, this does mean that the game has significant replayability.With great components, stunning artwork, fun competition, and a great thematic experience overall, Argent: The Consortium's strengths outweigh it's weaknesses.  If you like challenging and engaging worker placement games with lots going on, you will want to pick up this game!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26QWYY1DGUFZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936920204#wasThisHelpful","R26QWYY1DGUFZL","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Armada Invincible, from Zvezda, is a game of naval warfare and strategy set in the 16th century.  One player takes on the role of the English and the other the Spanish in the time of the Spanish Armada.  Each player receives a ship card and a command card, along with a dry erase marker to write on them.  Each player also receives a ship model which must be assembled before play.  Players then pick a scenario from the scenario book.  Simultaneously, players write down their orders on their command card- low mast, half mast, full mast- which give them movement tokens, and in which direction they are moving or turning.  Wind is set before the scenario, and depending on the ship's relationship to the wind, movement will cost more or less tokens for each space it moves.  If the enemy ship is in range and line of sight, players may begin combat.  Combat is also simultaneous, and players roll a number of D20s depending on how many cannons they have that are still active and charged.  Consulting a chart on the ship card, players are told what their dice rolls hit on.  Ships that sustain hits must cross of durability points in the hull along the port, starboard, or stern.  If every all the durability points on either side of a cannon are knocked out, the cannon itself is destroyed.  Also, once a cannon is fired it must recharge before it can fire a again.  One cannon on each side of the ship may recharge per turn.  Also, in combat, players can select which type of ammunition to use- chain, ball, or grapeshot.  There are also rules for crew, pikemen, and musketmen on deck, boarding parties, and more.  Each scenario has objectives and victory conditions, but if at any time all the durability points on one side of the ship are destroyed, the ship goes down and that player loses.Armada Invincible is a fun and engaging naval warfare game that really packs a punch.  The dry erase cards are a great way to keep track of information and the variation in options and scenarios mean that this game has a lot of replay value.  It is a game of constant tough decisions as you need to line up for an attack, but may not have the movement points because you'll turn into the wind.  Do you expose yourself this turn in the hopes of advantage on the following turn?  Or do turn away to regroup.  Do you close in tight and try to board, or do you keep your distance?  Should you try to dismast the enemy ship, or merely bombard and peck away at his cannons and durability points?The game's ship models are beautiful and highly detailed, but they must be assembled.  For those of us without a model building aptitude, that can be quite intimidating, (my friend assembled them for me).  Also, without glue or adhesives, the models tend to lose pieces during play and must be re-attached.  It is a little annoying but nothing that stops the game from being generally enjoyable and engaging.  If you like board games with strong historical themes and naval adventure, you just might want to check out Armada Invincible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7YHH8B8UDO4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L44OX8G#wasThisHelpful","R7YHH8B8UDO4M","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sellswords, from Level 99 Games, is a fun and engaging light card flipping game.  At the beginning of the game twelve cards are dealt out in a pile in the middle of the table.  Back and forth, each player takes one of the cards, which boasts a red side and a blue side, depending on who plays it.  Each card has four attack numbers on its sides, as well as special text that allows for special abilities during the game.  Placing a terrain card in the middle of the table, which may contain special modifiers to the game, players take turns placing their cards next to already placed cards or the terrain.  When a card's attack value on the side that is adjacent to an enemy card is greater than the enemy card's, the active player may flip the enemy card over to his color.  Each card's special abilities, however, can be game changers.  For instance, a card may allow you to attack a card two spaces away instead of just being adjacent.  One card will allow you to successfully any card around it, but then that card itself must be flipped.  Some cards effect scoring.  And there are many, many more.  Once all cards have been placed, scoring takes place by determining the number of your cards in rows and columns.  After two rounds, the player with the most points wins.Sellswords is a fun little card game.  The heart of the game is each card's special abilities, which allow for variation with each play.  Also, this game is very quick, each round playing in perhaps 10-15 minutes once players know what they are doing.  It is very light, and the mercenary theme, while present, is not particularly strong.  If the abstract nature of the game doesn't turn you off, you might really enjoy Sellswords as a two player opener for game night.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9TC9LRJSWW68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936920360#wasThisHelpful","R9TC9LRJSWW68","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Erich von Manstein was quite probably the most capable operational general from any nation in World War II.  The architect of the plan that ensured Germany's victory over France in 1940; the commander who took the Soviet fortress of Sevastopol; and the brilliant strategist who reformed the German line after the disaster at Stalingrad.  Von Manstein was undeniably a brilliant general.His memoir, ""Lost Victories,"" represents his version of events as they played out during World War II.  The book itself makes for some very dry reading.  There is a lot of operational talk (i.e. this numbered unit moved to this town, will on another sector of the line another numbered unit counter-attacked...).  If one is interested in the minutia of the war in Russia, then this book will be very informative and engaging.  Where this book shines, however, is in von Monstein's dealings with Hitler, who as the war dragged on increasingly micromanaged the war, often ignoring the advice of von Manstein and other generals, and blaming them when things deteriorated.  Von Manstein's portrait of Hitler is fascinating, and gives us a greater look at his unwillingness to cede any power when it came to the direction of the war.  The book also succeeds when von Manstein details the people with whom he worked and fought, a driver, a pilot, his son.  Von Manstein's human experience of the war among the most engaging parts of the book.The sections detailing von Manstein's attempts to relieve the 6th Army from Stalingrad are interesting, but again are far too dry to make for truly enjoyable reading.  The same could be said for the chapter about saving the front in the wake of Stalingrad.  The one section I was really looking forward to, von Manstein's role in Operation Citadel, the Battle of Kursk, clocks in at just four pages.  The translators, however, note that this chapter is not directly from von Manstein's notes, but rather a brief report he wrote later.  That was very disappointing.Also disappointing is von Manstein's commitment to only addressing the military matters at hand, and not addressing the dark reality of Hitler's regime.  This perpetuates the myth of the ""Clean Wehrmacht,"" where the German army had nothing to do with eastern front atrocities, which was supposedly the unique work of the SS and Gestapo.  In fact, the German army had a lot of civilian blood on its hands in the Soviet Union.  At Nuremberg, von Manstein stated that he constantly argued and fought against the SS during the Russian campaign.  In fact, his arguments never proved a moral objection to SS atrocities, but rather arguments over allotment of manpower, which was often used to commit atrocities regardless of who commanded- the SS or the army.  Von Manstein's unwillingness to address his role in eastern front atrocities, as well as his cowardly hiding behind a solely ""military"" memoir, echoes the tactics used by other figures from the Third Reich like Gen. Heinz Guderian and SS intelligence chief Walter Schellenberg.All told, ""Lost Victories"" is an important historical document for a number of reasons, but it is, ultimately, self-serving and incomplete.  Additionally, because of its dryness, this is not a book for the casual student of history.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TNRECDXXBJJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0760320543#wasThisHelpful","R2TNRECDXXBJJC","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This digital audio recorder is a great little package that is great for taking notes or other short term audio recordings you might need.  In addition to the recorder itself, the package includes a USB connection, microphone with lapel clip, headphones, and more.  Digital files are easily convertible into MP3 format, and the interface is incredibly easy to use- both for recording and for playback.  I say that this is a good device for taking notes and short term audio recordings because the recordings do contain a little static in the playback- not enough to detract from playing back notes or other similar functions.  I had thought I might be able to use this for audio recordings for video productions, but the quality is just not up to that challenge.  Still, for the price you get a solid digital recorder that is easy to use and produces good, if not great, quality recordings.Review copy of this product was provided free of charge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVKOH24T2TECS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9SI8IE#wasThisHelpful","RVKOH24T2TECS","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Blue Sun expansion for Firefly: The Game adds a map board extension, two new reaver vessels, new captains, new missions, new contacts, new worlds to trade with, and a ton of new tokens and cards.  Essentially, this game offers little in the way of new rules, but tons of ""stuff"" to you Firefly adventures.  Some minor new rules changes involve the placement of reaver ships, and the fact that when they move out of a sector they leave behind tokens that can trigger the appearance of a reaver ship when players' ships pass through them.  The expansion also replaces some existing cards with updated cards.If you love Firefly: The Game, you really need this expansion.  Where the reavers were a minor annoyance in the base game, they are a serious threat in this one.  Also, the expansion provides so many new options, adventures, and places to explore that I will never play Firefly again without it.  Blue Sun just makes a great game even better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RLHCRJV6X5AR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPD03W6#wasThisHelpful","R1RLHCRJV6X5AR","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Citadels, 2-8 players attempt to score the most victory points by assuming roles and building city districts.  Each player starts the game with two gold and a hand of district cards.  Then players pass around character cards- each with different powers.  There is the assassin, who can name another character (but he doesn't know who took that character card), to take them out of the game for a turn.  There is the thief who can steal gold from a named character.  There is the magician who can swap district hands with another player or with the deck.  There is the king, who gets to choose characters next time, and many more.  After you reveal you character and take its unique action, you can take two gold from the bank- also, some characters earn more gold depending on the types of buildings them build.  Or you can take two cards from the district deck and keep one.  Then, you may build a building from your hand by paying its cost.  Many different buildings also allow the player certain powers.  It's gold cost is also its victory point value.  As soon as someone is the first to build eight buildings the game hits the end phase and at the end of the round the game is over.  Players total up their victory points from buildings and a few other factors and whoever has the most is the winner.Citadels is a fun and engaging game of bluffing and hidden roles.  In many ways it is reminiscent of other popular card games like Love Letter and Coup.  When playing characters like the assassin and the thief, you must wisely pick your target, and that often depends on looking at each players' buildings.  A player that has many green buildings may have picked the merchant, because he gets extra gold for the buildings- the king is the same with yellow buildings, the warlord the same with red, etc...  It is a very engaging game that keeps all players invested throughout, because you never know who is who and you must constantly weight the advantages of selecting defensive characters against the necessity of selecting more aggressive or profitable ones.The game does have a few minor drawbacks.  For instance, when passing character cards around players with analysis paralysis can take a long time to select their role, which leads to a lot of downtime for everyone else.  Also, games with a lot of players can go on for a bit longer than you would hope, and sometimes the last few rounds tend to be less fun and engaging because of it.  Still, these are minor complaints in what is really a fun game that both serious and casual gamers should really take to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JI79KQG39VI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=158994030X#wasThisHelpful","R2JI79KQG39VI4","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Villainous Vikings, from Victory Point Games, is a wonderful strategic game that plays in about 60-90 minutes and is set among the rampaging, long-bearded fellows from up north.  Three to five players take on the roles of a viking ship's captain and crew.  First you must select a captain card which boasts special abilities- one static ability and a few abilities contingent on dice rolls.  You ship is made up of three cards which represent different colored dice- gray, white, and red.  A journey deck is prepared using cards from Age I, Age II, and Age III.  The cards are laid out and each turn players can take too actions, traveling to locations in the journey deck, attacking those locations, hiring mercenaries, trading, repairing ships, and other actions.  If a ship moves to a location with another ship, battle ensues.Battle is very interesting in this game.  Essentially, you are rolling to get the most swords.  Some captains have static sword abilities, and some warriors you can recruit will to.  Players roll the dice depending on what condition their ship is in.  Swords add to combat power, but rolling hammers trigger your captain's special abilities, which may result in more swords or other surprises to help you win.  Rolling shields help to block sword damage, which will destroy part of your ship if it is not blocked.  Players may also buy swords for gold, or may sacrifice a warrior card or location card in order to gain more.  There are a lot of choices to make when attempting victory.  Finally, sometime at the end of Age III, the Ragnarok card will come out, leading to one final roll off between the players.  The winner gets the Ragnarok card with it's bonus victory points.  Players then tally up the victory points from their various cards, gold, and bonuses, and whoever has the most is the winner.Villainous Vikings is a great strategy game that offers players some really touch choices and depth.  How and when to sacrifice cards in combat is crucial, as is knowing what to do with your actions each round.  The game is really one of risk management, as you must decide to attack locations or other players and just what you are willing to sacrifice in terms of victory points and persistent bonuses to win the battle.  A beautiful game design and a whole lot of fun, Villainous Vikings was a big hit with my game group, and I think a lot of people will really enjoy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ISMP9WCYDFI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MH7HPVQ#wasThisHelpful","R3ISMP9WCYDFI6","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Star Wars: Imperial Assault, from Fantasy Flight Games, is Star Wars in a box- minus the space battles.  The game can be played in two ways- as a two player skirmish game, and as a 2-5 player campaign game.  First of all, in the two player skirmish game, one player plays the rebels and the other plays the Imperials.  Players select a scenario to play, and set up the tie map accordingly.  They each have so many points with which to build an army, and select various characters and their corresponding cards.  Then players work to meet the victory conditions of the scenario.In the campaign game, one player takes on the role of the Imperials while the others pick heroes to play throughout the campaign, using different cards than they do during the skirmish game.  While the Rebel heroes are largely generic characters created for this game, it is possible to meet up with allies like Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.  Also, the Imperial player can activate Darth Vader and other characters to help him crush the Rebel scum.  Players have two actions each during the game, moving, attacking, interacting with objects, etc...  and play alternates between one Rebel hero and one Imperial unit.  Depending on whether the heroes meet their objectives or not, the story will advance in a certain way.  Between games, the Rebel and Imperial players will all have the opportunity to upgrade, and the Imperial may also prepare a number of nasty surprises for the Rebels.Combat in this game is really cool.  Each unit/upgrade card tells the player which colored dice to roll when attacking and defending.  Players can roll damage points, which damage the target, or surge icons, which can be spent on the unit's unique abilities for different outcomes.  The defender can roll a black or white dice which can block damage points or cancel surge icons.  The ""X"" on the white dice can cancel at attack all together.  The attacking dice also have an accuracy rating which is used for determining success in ranged attacks.  It's a great dice rolling mechanic that contains a lot of luck, but still gives players a measure of choice over how to use their surge icons.  The campaign evolves over the course of the missions.  In addition to upgrades, players will get the opportunity to go on new missions, set agendas, and see an original Star Wars story come alive on the tabletop.All told, Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a fantastic dungeon crawl adventure set in the rich Star Wars universe.  If you love Star Wars- and who doesn't- and great tabletop games, you'll want to pick this one up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TINBX29N42S6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616619902#wasThisHelpful","R1TINBX29N42S6","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was in high school I read Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire trilogy and loved it.  I read several other Star Wars novels after that that ranged from mildly interesting to outright atrocious.  It kind of put me off of Star Wars books for a long time.  Then I picked up James Luceno's ""Star Wars: Tarkin"" on a whim.  I loved it, and when I saw that he had written about the master of Darth Sidious, I thought I'd give it a try as well.  I loved it, too.""Star Wars: Darth Plagueis"" tells the stories of Hego Damask, aka Darth Plagueis, and his apprentice Palapatine, aka Darth Sidious.  A Muun, Plagueis was at the heart of the Intergalactic Banking Clan, and commanded great wealth and influence in the galaxy.  Secretly a Sith, he sought to bring down the Republic and restore Sith rule to the galaxy.  Finding the young, troubled Palpatine on Naboo, a world with commercial interests that fit into Plagues' plans, the Sith master took the young noble under his wing.  What follows next is the story of the two men's plans to overthrow the established order and usher in the reign of the Dark Side of the Force.This novel is highly political, and the action is much more potential than kinetic.  It is a story of plans within plans, misdirection, and subtlety.  Don't expect many grand space battles, though there are a few dramatic confrontations, split second escapes, and other adventures.  If, like me, you find Palpatine a fascinating character, you will devour this novel as his dramatic rise and terrible machinations come to light.  Beginning several decades before the Battle of Yavin, (Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope), the action occurs all the way up through the events in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, and Palpatine's election as Supreme Chancellor.  It's very fun too peel back the curtains and take a look at this iconic character, probably my favorite in all of Star Wars.  The book is a great, quick read and abounds in Dark Side fun!  Though probably not for everybody, if you love the politics of the Star Wars universe, you'll no doubt get a big kick out ""Star Wars: Darth Plagueis"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8REPSK5XXNVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345511298#wasThisHelpful","R8REPSK5XXNVZ","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Munchkin Panic incorporates the silly Munchkin theme from Steve Jackson Games and the Castle Panic mechanics from Fireside Games.  Up to six players must defend their castle, even as they seek to become the sole winner by scoring the most victory points.  In the center of the board is a castle, with a number of walls and towers.  Extending outward from the center are a series of rings, which are separated into ranges- forest, archers, knights, swordsmen.  The rings are divided laterally into three colors- blue, red, and green.  Players receive a number of castle cards for their turn which indicate a color and range, meaning that you can score a hit against a monster in that space.  The monsters are activated at the end of every players' turn, then new monsters are added to the board.  Players also have the option of negotiating for cards, but some players may not want to give other players their cards because, though they all want to protect the castle, other players may not want you to get the points for the kill.  The monsters win if they can knock down all of the towers at the center of the board.  The players win if the castle can survive the onslaught of the monsters' attack.  Then, players add up their individual points and whoever has the most is the winner.I am not a huge fan of silly games, and Munchkin never really captured my imagination.  I have never played Castle Panic, though I did play Dead Panic.  While I enjoyed Dead Panic, I thought that there were other zombie games out there that did what that game did but did it better (i.e. Zombicide).  Munchkin Panic straddles a very thin line here- it's a cooperative game but there can be only one winner.  It's a bit of a contradiction and this kind of semi-cooperative game can be really tricky.  Marvel: Legendary manages to do it quite well, and there are others.  Here, the individual victory must take a backseat to the really cooperative elements of the game, largely because the monsters just keep coming.  You're working too hard to kill them to think too much about stabbing each other in the back.  When some cards allow you to screw over an opponent, you really think twice about playing it because the odds are it will screw over you as well in the long run.There are some fun thematic ideas here (insurance salesmen and lawyers being monsters, for one), and the game is generally enjoyable.  It is not, however, a great game.  Mechanically, it just doesn't quite work the way the designers had intended and, personally at least, the theme didn't thrill me.  There are a lot of Munchkin lovers at there, and I believe a lot of people will really enjoy Munchkin Panic, but it really is just not my cup of tea.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R54Q82CKXJ20C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD176IE#wasThisHelpful","R54Q82CKXJ20C","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Knightmare Chess is back, and it's better than ever!  Combining both Knightmare Chess (1994) and Knightmare Chess II (1998), this new third edition contains 158 cards that really bring some fun adventures and wild chaos to the traditional game of chess.  Both players select up to 150 points worth of cards, (each card has a point value depending on how powerful it is), and have their own decks during the game.  On a players turn he may play a card after his move, though some cards allow players to play a card during an opponent's move.  The cards themselves are a lot of fun.  One card makes enemy knights drunk, essentially allowing a player to move an opponent's knight one space after it has moved.  One card allows the creation of a new unit, the princess, provided the king and queen are next to each other.  One card allows you to move a unit next to enemy pieces, then explode, killing your own unit but capturing all adjacent units (except a king).  One card turns your king into a warlord, allowing him to move up to two spaces per turn.  Some cards allow you to copy enemy cards, or steal them, or negate them.  My favorite card, however, is the Doomsayer card.  When it is played the next player to say the name of a piece loses that piece himself.  It keeps players on their toes and forces them to watch their words as they play.Unlike a traditional game of chess, which forces players to think two or three moves ahead, Knightmare Chess makes planning a long-term strategy impossible.  Because the cards can radically alter the game from one turn to the next, players must learn to improvise and constantly reassess their situation. You and your opponent will be laughing at the unexpected twists every time some unusual card or ability is played.  Knightmare Chess is great fun and really brings something new to the chessboard.  If you're a fan of chess, you will get a kick out of the new options and possibilities that this game offers.  If you don't like chess, you will love this unique variant which plays very differently than the chess you remember.

Each player can build an army of dragons and other fantasy miniatures (assuming you have bought more expansions than just the core set), outfit them with upgrades, and then prepare to battle.  On a players' turn, he or she secretly selects what movement their dragon is going to make with a dial, then, based from lowest to highest on the dragon's level (initiative), the dragons activate.  Players use templates to guide their dragons along a path, moving them to another location in the play area.  Unlike Warhammer or other minis games, Flight Path games require no tape measurers, or awkward movement mechanics.  After movement, players can choose from several action options to help them in battle.  Once all the dragons have activated, the dragon with the highest level attacks first.  All dragons have either front (bite) or rear (tail) melee attacks, or they can attack with their upgrade cards.  All dragons attack within an arc before or behind them.  Red dice is rolled for attacks, while green dice is rolled for defense.  Players can choose to play scenario driven games or basic elimination games.D&D: Attack Wing is a generally fun game, though this is a game that was meant to be played with expansions.  One aspect that is different from previous Flight Path games is ground troops and combat.  Each dragon has two maneuver dials, ground and flight.  Playing with expansions could open up some really fun adventures for this game, but the base game really plays too similar to Star Wars and Star Trek to really feel like anything new and exciting.  The lesson is: if you want to pick this starter set up, be prepared to invest some money in expansions if you want the full experience.  I will not be collecting D&D: Attack Wing, as I am already heavily invested in Star Wars (and for a time collected Star Trek as well).  If you prefer the D&D universe, you may want to get started collecting this game with this starter set.  Just be prepared for the long haul if you really want to enjoy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VOJLH6J0KP4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IR7A4RC#wasThisHelpful","R1VOJLH6J0KP4X","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Golem Arcana, from Harebrained Schemes, is a fantastically fun adventure that takes board gaming to the next level.  The base game comes with six beautifully painted miniatures, as well as a stylus.  Players must download a free app to a smartphone or tablet.  Programming in which minis they are using, players build an army.  Then, tapping the minis, the appropriate cards, the game board, and the app, players can wage an epic fantasy skirmish.  The app is easy to use and really brings a video game feel to the tabletop- in fact, this game brilliantly meshes board gaming and video gaming.  I was initially skeptical about a board game that required an app, but playing made a believer out of me.  Golem Arcana is a very fun game that brings something new, unique, and exciting to the tabletop.  Check it out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7VMW9HEHGA12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LXJBCHM#wasThisHelpful","R7VMW9HEHGA12","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I heard someone talking about Gravwell I thought it sounded very complicated and not much fun.  When I read the rules it seemed less complicated and I thought it could be okay.  I played it- and immediately fell in love with it.  Gravwell is very easy to learn and play.  Up to four players take on the roles of spaceship crews as they try to escape the gravity of a black hole- but they have to use each other's gravitational forces to break free.  Sounds like something only Stephen Hawking would get, right?  Wrong!The game plays out over the course of six rounds.  A spiral arm filled with spaces extends outward from the center singularity, where the players begin, toward a warp gate- the players' objective.  A number of cards are laid out based on the number of players x3.  A three player game would see nine cards laid out- face down, then nine more face up on top of them.  Beginning with the youngest player on the first turn, (then with the player closest to the singularity on subsequent turns), players choose cards they want to use.  Each player then has a hand of six cards that they keep hidden from the other players.  Cards have two pieces of information upon them- a number of spaces to move, and an element corresponding to one letter of the alphabet.  Players play their cards simultaneously, and cards are resolved in descending from A to Z.  Here's the thing- players move toward the closet ship, whether it is in front of or behind them.  Because you don't know turn order until you all play the cards, nobody knows if they will be moving forward or backward during the turn.  In addition to the regular movement cards, there are also repulsor cards, which act in the opposite fashion of regular cards, and move you away from the nearest ship; and tractor beam cards, which pull all ships closer to the active player.  Also, each player has his/her own emergency stop card that can be played once per round, essentially allowing you to cancel your movement for one turn.  In addition to the player spaceships, two derelict ships are spaced out on the spiral arm, and can provide positive or negative gravity to your ship along the way.  The winner is the first player to make it to the warp gate, or, after six rounds, the closest player to the warp gate.Gravwell is a whole lot of fun and surprisingly simple in its mechanics.  This is game that you and your friends/family will laugh with as each of your cards play out- many with unexpected consequences.  It's a game of personalities and outguessing your opponents as much as it is a simple movement game.  I'm constantly amazed at how often times the simplest mechanics and ideas can create such wonderful gaming experiences, and Gravwell is definitely one of those games.  If you love to laugh while sitting around your tabletop, and have a fun space-themed adventure to boot, you will definitely want to check out Gravwell.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ICJ15TA3F2NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617682934#wasThisHelpful","R3ICJ15TA3F2NP","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Timeline -Americana, is another get Timeline game, this one covering American history.  The Timeline games have to be about the easiest games to learn and to play out there.  Essentially, each player begins the game with a hand of cards containing some event or other historical item.  On the back is the year that that event occurred, and players may not look at the back.  One card is drawn from the deck and placed face up, revealing the year.  Going clockwise around the board, players place of their cards either to the right (before), the left (after), or in between cards that have already been placed, then reveal the card.  If you placed the card in the right location, you do not need to draw another card.  If, on the other hand, you guessed wrong, the card is placed in the correct position and you must draw a new card.  The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all of your cards.A very simple game, Timeline -Americana is a wonderful challenge that will engage young and old alike.  Children will learn a lot about history, and so will adults who didn't pay attention in class.  This is great, highly educational game that I recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CZEUEGB3WJ00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGFGC7M#wasThisHelpful","R3CZEUEGB3WJ00","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The First World War, from Mayfair Games, is a fun and engaging light wargame set in the 1914-1918 conflict.  Up to four players take on the roles of belligerents: The Western Allies, Russia and minor states, Germany, Austria and minor states.  The game does not play out like a conventional wargame.  In fact, the game almost feels more like a eurogame with wargame theme.  The board is divided into three theaters: The Western Front, the Eastern Front, and the Italian Front.  Each front is then divided into several sections across which players' armies advance.  These lines of advance contain cities- squares represent victory point cities while circles represent supply cities.  At either end of each line is a base.  Players have a number of army chits of varying power, as well as many dummy armies with no power.  At the beginning of each round players place their armies and dummy armies face down in the various sections of the front.  Then, players take turns launching attacks or moving units around the board.  In combat, players reveal their armies in a section, discard dummies, then roll a dice and add it to their lead unit's strength.  The loser's lead unit is eliminated, while the winner gets to place an advance token on the next city in the line.  If the winner captures a square, he gets a victory point.  If he captures a circle, he can deny reinforcements to the enemy.  If he advances toward a base, the loser must move their surrender token up a point on the surrender track.  At the end of the round if a player has any points on the surrender track he must roll a dice.  If the number is equal to or less that the number of the track, they immediately lose the game.  Otherwise, players play out six rounds and at the end whoever has the most victory points wins the games.The First World War is a fun and unique wargame with eurogame feel to it.  Much of the game is bluffing, placing the dummy armies in sections of the board that are threatened, in order to prevent other players from attacking.  Every player is stretched to the limit in terms of military resources, and the game does a good job of simulating just how powerful, yet relatively evenly matched, both sides in WWI actually were.  Players can also gain tokens which can add factors to attacks and defense.  Some tokens give no advantage- but your opponent doesn't know that- adding to the great bluffing mechanics of the game.There is one drawback for this game.  The rulebook is not good.  It is overly complex and struggles to communicate relatively simple ideas and concepts.  Fortunately, with resources like boardgamegeek and others, you can find examples of play and amended rulebooks online that will make learning the game easier.All told The First World War is a fun wargame/eurogame hybrid that offers a lot of strategic challenge while still being very much about the personalities of the people playing.  I highly recommend this game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R340BMQCY5EDVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009FU02O#wasThisHelpful","R340BMQCY5EDVZ","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me add my voice to the chorus calling this game fantastic!  Commands & Colors: Napoleonics is the best of Richard Borg's C&C system so far.  With 15 scenarios spanning the Napoleonic Wars in Spain and during the Waterloo campaign, the game has a highly historical theme.  Game play is always the thing, of course, and C&C Napoleonics is a whole lot of fun.  The board is divided into three sections- right flank, middle, and left flank, and players play cards to activate units in the specific sections.  Units are made up of a number of blocks representing infantry, artillery, cavalry, and generals.  Each unit has several sub units like line infantry, light infantry, guards, grenadiers, etc...  Each unit has unique characteristics that really add some fun variation to the battlefield.  Also, there are a number of really cool cards that also add some fun surprises to the game.  First Strike allows the target of a melee attack to attack first, possible forcing the attacking unit to retreat.  Rally allows players to return blocks to multiple units and then attack with them.For these reasons and more C&C Napoleonics is now my favorite C&C game.  Memoir '44 may be better for players newer to this system, but experienced players should really get a kick out of the variety that C&C Napoleonics brings to the table.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S0I0S6D72EOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HH11MS#wasThisHelpful","R2S0I0S6D72EOP","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Walter Borneman's biography, ""Polk: The Man Who Transformed the Presidency and America"", is a solid look at our 11th president.  Written with a good pace that never skimps on facts, ""Polk"" examines the life of this extraordinary, though often neglected, historical figure.  Borneman correctly points out that had Clay, Van Buren, or another candidate won the 1844 presidential election, the very borders of the United States might look very different today.  The author also states that few U.S. presidents enjoyed as much success as Polk.  From the start of his administration Polk set out to do four things: create an independent treasury, reorganize America's tariff laws, settle the Oregon question with Britain, and acquire what is now the American southwest from Mexico- by either diplomacy or force.  All four goals were achieved and Polk lived up to his promise to serve only one term.  This work is no hagiography, however, and Borneman frequently shows Polk's less admirable qualities.  Due is given to the ambiguity under which Polk requested a declaration of war against Mexico, and his often petty prejudices and dislikes against other American notables.One of the main reasons I picked up this book was to learn more about the U.S.-Mexican War.  While the book does contain a great amount of detail on the subject, too often it is at the expense of the biography, and the book reads more like a straight history narrative in these chapters.  As history it is a wonderful exploration of the war, but as biography, it falls a bit flat.  There are several relatively large sections of these chapters that do not deal directly with Polk at all, but rather figure like Zachary Taylor, Winfield Scott, John C. Fremont, and others.  In fairness, Borenman notes this in the introduction.  Still, a closet tie to the subject during the narrative is always appreciated in a biography.All told, however, this is a fine look at an amazing period of U.S. history, seen through the perspective of one of its principle players.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ONSCEGN1QSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812976746#wasThisHelpful","R13ONSCEGN1QSB","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Taylor Digital scale is beautiful and functional.  I'm really impressed with how thin it is, and the sleek design is a great addition to my bathroom decor.

"Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion, from Fantasy Flight Games, is a two player card game in which one side takes on the evil empire and the other side takes on, you guessed it, the rebellion.  The game takes place over a series of rounds.  First of all, an event card is drawn from the event deck.  The event card has an objective number, the number both players are trying to hit without going over, as well as telling players how many cards they can play that round.  Players each then secretly choose a strategy card which will be revealed at the end of the round, and can alter the game in certain ways, or give certain advantages to one side or the other under certain conditions.On a players turn he or she can do one of several things: First, players can play cards- essentially drawing a resource card from their deck and putting it on the table.  Next, a player can use a played card's power by rotating it 90 degrees.  Then, a player has the option of spending influence tokens to return a rotated card back to its starting position.  Finally, a player can pass.  Once both players have passed, the round is over.  Players then both reveal their strategy cards, and depending on the conditions of the cards, players check to see who came the closest to the event card's objective number without going over.  Whoever did so wins the round and claims the event card.  Each event card also carries a VP value, as well as possibly an influence number- the winner gets that many influence tokens.  The first player to score 7 points wins the game.That is essentially the game, though there is quite a bit more to it than that.  For instance, resource cards all have a numeric value, in addition to their text abilities, and character resource cards numeric value change drastically when they are exhausted- making manipulation of these cards key to winning the game.  Occasionally, players will paint themselves into a corner, haviong no legal moves left and must concede the round.  It's a balancing act that offers some touch choices and real competition.  The Star Wars theme is there with the photos and text, though it's not terribly strong.  I believe this engine originally started with another game and Fantasy Fight Games slapped the Star Wars IP onto it.  The theme is there, for sure, it's just not as strong as it is in, say, Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures.Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion plays in about an hour.  It is a generally fun, relatively fast-paced card game that fans of Star Wars should get a kick out of.  Fans of fairly light-to-medium card games should enjoy it as well.  The game does get a bit repetitive after a while, though I suspect this is not a game that players will play constantly.  Rather, this is a great once-in-a-while light-to-medium card game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28KMKCMLSQ3HC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616618078#wasThisHelpful","R28KMKCMLSQ3HC","AHHUNTFQGUGX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHUNTFQGUGX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The DC Comics Deck Building Game: Forever Evil is a brand new base set for the popular (or is that infamous?) Cryptozoic Entertainment deck building engine.  Here, 2-5 players take on the roles of various super-villains from the DC Comics universe like Lex Luthor and Black Adam as they attempt to take down various superheroes like Wonder Woman and the Flash.  Mechanically, the game works almost exactly like the DC Comics Deck Building Game and its sequel, Heroes Unite- so much so that cards from Forever Evil can be mixed together with cards from the other sets.  There are a few, slight mechanical differences here.  First of all, the cards in this set emphasize attack far more than the previous sets do, leading to slightly more player interaction in this game, (one of the chief complaints of the first two games, other than the thematic issues, was that each player essentially played their own solitaire game).  Also, players will be able to, and indeed are often rewarded for, destroying cards.  This means, as decks evolve in the game, they don't necessarily become very thick.  Indeed, the game boasts some pretty thin decks by game's end.  Another departure from the other games, Forever Evil features VP tokens.  In addition to the victory points that are on most cards, players may be rewarded with VP tokens throughout the game, and may have opportunities to steal VP tokens from other players with attacks.  Mr. Freeze cards allow players to freeze certain cards in the line-up, essentially taking them out of play for a turn and possibly destroying them, (Why this needs a token, as opposed to just turning the card over, I don't know).As stated above, this is the third set in the DC Comics Deck Building Game line.  Each one of these games, and Cryptozoic's Lord of the Rings Deck Building Games, are essentially the same.  Each game has its minor adjustments, unique cards, and other quirks, but generally speaking, if you've played one you've played them all.  Understanding this, how does one rank Forever Evil?  Mechanically, with its emphasis on attack and card destruction, it may be the best of the bunch.  As stated above, those things really add a new dimension to the game, within the general parameters of Cryptozoic's deck building system.  Also, the VP tokens bring some fun new angles to the game.  The card combinations, however, may be the weakest of the three DC games.  It's nothing I can put my finger on, but generally I enjoyed the flow of the game and the powers of the cards much better in the other games, (Heroes Unite is probably my favorite of the three in that department).  It's something of a trade- best mechanics, weakest cards.  Still, if you like the engine, despite its thematic flaws (which I'm not going to rehash here), you should really take to Forever Evil.One final thing.  Cryptozoic needs to stop releasing these base sets of this game and instead just call them what they should be- expansions.  In addition to main deck cards, each set comes with weakness card, kick cards, punch cards, and vulnerability card.  WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE OF THESE CARDS, CRYPTOZOIC.  Seriously, Cryptozoic is simply upping the price by making each of these titles stand alone games.  It's a bit tacky and fairly off-putting to those of us who have stood by this game system, despite the haters and the thematic flaws.  Please, please, please- no more base sets, just give us expansions like the other good game companies do.

"I know this book is supposed to be a classic and that it has a huge following of devoted fans. Personally, I just couldn't get into it. I trudged and stuck with it as far as I could (3/4 of the book) but, frankly, couldn't identify with the characters or immerse myself in the plot. I found it rather somber and unexciting. It is probably realistic for the time and place (obviously, since it was written by a contemporary author), I found the  constant struggle, never-ending challenges, and an outlook which I perceived as lacking hope and optimism to be rather wearing on me as a reader. The heroine is certainly heroic and praise-worthy, but she lacks the spark and charm which other heroines (such as Elizabeth Bennet) have to get themselves (and the reader) through the difficult times. She is somewhat reminiscent of Mary Bennet, except that she is truly virtuous instead of merely tedious.Is it possible that, in the last quarter, the cloud of doom is lifted, the characters bloom, and the plot becomes uplifting? Maybe.

"This bedrail is designed to take with you when you travel. While I think it's feasible to take with you when you travel by car, I'm not too sure that it's especially feasible to take a bedrail with you--any bedrail--when you travel by plane.Having said that, for me it's absolutely perfect as a home bedrail. I like that it's not  almost bed length, as most are. (I think most bedrails are meant to keep the person from rolling off the bed and falling, not to provide support and stability). It only occupies a little bit of space so as not to limit your access of leg movements when climbing in or getting off a bed. This is good design because many products that are designed to solve one problem end up causing another, but not in this case.My use of the bedrail is primarily for stability. Since my heart operation, I am a bit unsteady going from a lying down position to standing. This helps me, not only by giving me something to hold on to while my world steadies, but also the bonus of something to hold on to getting in and out of bed. The design allows for a place to put my kindle and glasses and does not interfere with the cpap machine tubing.My installation is permanent. I have a king sized posturepedic mattress (which weighs a ton). Getting the safety strap under and across the mattress was quite a project and we had to wait until my son came by to accomplish it. I don't plan on ever undoing it. It did secure firmly to the bedframe on the other side of the bed and it feels solid as a rock and I'm confident and secure when holding on to it and don't let go until I've slipped on my slippers and I'm sure I can walk steadily. It has been a blessing for me and given me and my husband peace of mind as I'd come close to falling a couple of times before I had it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7IHFGGN3FDVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GUDGXW#wasThisHelpful","R7IHFGGN3FDVQ","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lonely Planet's ""Wine Trails"" is an interesting hybrid between between a travel book you can use for planning & a coffee table book you can lay out for eye candy and casualk reading for your family and guests. One could spin that negatively--it neither has the glossy pages and printing of a true coffee-table book nor the detailed planning tools of a normal Lonely Planet guidebook--but to me it's a lovely book that will inspire you to travel and give you at least the first tools to start planning your trip.I should disclose that I'm a big foodie and an even bigger traveler who finds that the world's wine regions are usually spectacullarly beautiful places to visit, but I'm not a wine connoisseur so it will be difficult for me to assess the quality of their vineyard recommendations. I'll leave that to other reviewers and focus here on the layout and detail of the book and its usefulness for travel inspiration and casual reading enjoyment.The book is extremely well orgtanized and easy to search through. Most of the world's famous wine regions are covered, each with it own chapter., as the book focuses on 52 wine regions (one for each week in the year) in twenty countries. Besides the ones I would have expected, there are some under-my-radar choices like Hungary and The Republic of Georgia. Within each chapter/wine region the book gives you nearly a dozen winery recommendations with photos, blurbs, and information. They also give you a handful of food recipes in each place and maps to help begin to plan your itinerary.The photos are beautiful though, again, my one criticism is that their beauty is somewhat undercut by being printed on matte instead of glossy paper. On graphic design, I'd give the book and A+. The wine bottle graphics are gorgeous and clever and the layout of the book is just a joy to flip through..","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36XE7X4FZDAKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743607504#wasThisHelpful","R36XE7X4FZDAKR","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was attracted to the idea of recycled battery power but, as it turns out, so little of what makes up the battery is actually recycled that the difference is negligible. As far as performance is concerned, once you're used to lithium batteries, going back to alkaline is a step back. Compared to other alkaline batteries, I haven't noticed any difference in performance or durability. (I've only tried them on low-demand items such as wall clocks and remote controls.The part I do like is that the unused batteries should last 12 years in storage.

"At times, the balance between fantasy and reality is strongly tilted on the side of reality. For example, if youre making up an imaginary country anyway, why does the actual location of the country matter? Why cant you not set it up between Spain and Portugaleven if that is not strictly possible in the real world? Why have to recruit citizens for a country that exists only in your imagination, or get an internet presence for it, or apply to the UN for membership?This is supposed to be an exercise in imagination and setting perimeters that are too academic might inhibit a child from wanting to complete the project on his own. (Although, as a teaching/learning experience for a classroom project it would be great.)But what the book does very well is make the child aware of all the different and taken-for-granted aspects that characterize a nation and make it functional and unique. Although it sometimes goes into too much detail (flag-raising rules), other factors such as postage stamps, currency, natural resources, border security, education, transportation, health care, and so on are serious and thought-provoking without being boring.The book does succeed in creating awareness of what it takes to govern, the importance of a strong economy, the relationship between governments and the governed and between other nations. When watching the news or learning of current events, he will be more aware of how each event fits into the larger picture.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15EQ8IHD2PT0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743607849#wasThisHelpful","R15EQ8IHD2PT0L","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My grandson has been diagnosed with ADHD and was given a prescription for a medication to help him concentrate in school. My daughter (his mother) was understandably hesitant to medicate him. I found this product on Amazon and figured it was worth a try. It worked so gradually that we really didn't notice the transition or that it was, in effect, making a difference. Then he had a stomach virus and didn't take it for four days. That is when we noticed how much more active and less attentive he became. After taking it again for a few days, we went back to what we call the ""new normal.""Don't get me wrong: this isn't a cure. What it does is tune down the hyperactivity somewhat so he can concentrate a little more, listen longer, get a little less frustrated, and be a little more still when doing ordinary things (like watching Ninja Turtles without jumping on the furniture.) He is still an active child, he still struggles, but he blends pretty well in with the other first graders. His teacher is satisfied with his progress and seldom has a complaint. He is still the same happy, smart, loving, and fun child he has always been and we are delighted that we didn't put him on a strong medication that might have changed his personality. We love him just the way he is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJ50ONFMHGVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GFPCW0#wasThisHelpful","RRJ50ONFMHGVJ","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I somehow missed the moment that made Elizabeth fall in love with Darcy. One page she wasn't and the next she was. That is a fairly common occurrence in these variations--actually, even in the original the transition is sort of forced. But I love the books that build it up gradually. But the main reason for only giving it three stars is that the editing errors were so noticeable that even using a spell-checker would have been an notable improvement.

"I probably ordered the wrong adapter for my particular PC (read the other posts regarding DVI vs something else. The pins did fit in without forcing but maybe that's normal). So that part of the malfunction may have been my fault. In any case, it didn't work.HOWEVER, the design part of the malfunction was not a consumer error. The way the unit is designed you cannot screw in the little screws with your hands because they are small and hard to grasp and turn and, due to the protrusion at the other end it is impossible to hold a screwdriver at the right angle to get access to the screw. You sort of have to use the screwdriver sideways.(Note the illustration: those little silver things at the narrower end are what you have to find a way to fasten securely to the CPU.

"I never believed it was possible to make a laptop that weighs less than the I-pad. Yet, here it is. It's so beautiful. it's almost art. It comes loaded with all kinds of apps; the system is fast in every respect; the keyboard has a soft but responsive feel; the screen resolution is gorgeous; the sound is exceptional. It's not only great to have at home and take with you to work, but it's also the ideal size (and weight!) to travel with--especially now that airlines are getting so nasty about what everything weighs.Is it perfect? We'll, it falls just a little bit short. I am not enamored of Windows 10 (despite the high hopes I had for it as a substitute for Windows 8). As of today, Microsoft is acknowledging that there are networking problems with the operating system that they are working hard to fix. Unfortunately, I am experiencing them and it doesn't make for a happy camper. The internet disconnects spontaneously--assuming I can log in at all, which I usually can. But, since Windows 10 is not the computer's fault and a fix is on the way, let's skip ahead.As you might imagine, it has no cd drive (it couldn't possibly fit in!). In this age of streaming movies and downloading software, that is less relevant than it would have been before, but I'm old-fashioned enough to miss it. The only real problems are keyboard related: 1) in order to keep the design sleek and modern, the letters are thin and don't contrast much against the metallic keys. Some keys (like the period and comma) are so small, you hardly see them. 2) The other design flaw I find is that the lit keyboard, while gorgeous, is not terribly helpful. The part that is lit is the area around each key. You see where the keys are, but not what the keys are. (Other lit keyboards have the letters lit from below so you actually see the letters, but with painted-on letters you can't do that).Anyway, the pluses so far outweigh the minuses that this is an incredible machine to have and the fact that it's drop-dead gorgeous is an added advantage.

"This light saber is pretty impressive. It has a hefty feel (much better than the Luke and Darth Vader light sabers which are much more lightweight and plastic looking) and great sound and light effects. When I received it (around Halloween and before the  December release of The Force Awakens) it has less impact than I'm assuming it will have once my grand son finds out exactly who Kylo Ren actually is. He will also know what a light dagger is (one is included here) and how it's used. Actually, I'm sort of glad because his imagination has to kick in a bit more during play.Right now, he is tremendously impressed with the light saber and will take it out on Halloween dressed as Darth Vader. He is the envy of the block and I'm glad for the light (which is pretty bright and attention-catching) which will make him more visible as he trick or treats.As with other light sabers, it is a toy to play with mostly outdoors if you don't want them to knock over a lamp or something. Unlike others it has the advantage/disadvantage that it is part of a system of light sabers that can interconnect (read: additional purchases) which, I imagine, will be promoted after the film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUI8ZQC2YJALL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOFZZVW#wasThisHelpful","RUI8ZQC2YJALL","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second ""portable power pack."" The first one I owned was a nameless brand I picked up from a display at Target for $5.99 (they have since stopped carrying it.) I liked the concept since I'm the type of person who always forgets to charge her cell phone (assuming I remember to take it). That power packed lasted for exactly 5 charges and then it just died.I figured that something made by HP would be somewhat better and I have not been disappointed. I have used it more than 20 times and it still charges my phone (it takes it from no charge at all to 58%, and I can use it with the cord attached beginning at about 15% charged). So, performance-wise it, so far, earns 5 stars.What is absolutely awful is the ""instruction"" factor. It comes with a leaflet that says the same useless thing about 5 volts in about 50 languages and a gray scale drawing of the unit. Most of it is self-explanatory except the bit about the lights. It has four blue lights (that look no different in either of the gray scale drawings) and it doesn't tell you what the lights mean. I know that they blink when charging but they don't seem to indicate anything (fully charged? 50%? ).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G8F5GL4YPRBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8JGSMO#wasThisHelpful","R1G8F5GL4YPRBZ","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This polarizer is the first I have ever owned and I'm still in a state of awe and wonder. As a new user, it has made me realize a few things:1. If you spent good money on a good lens, it makes no sense to put a cheap bit of glass in front of it. This glass is not cheap in either cost nor quality. It is more of an investment than an expense.2. Outdoor photos, particularly landscapes look so much sharper and richer. Even photographing a simple bush, you notice the difference. The bush without the polarizing filter reflects glare on each leaf and that glare ends up making the image look softer. With the filter, you kill most of the glare and each leaf can come into sharp focus.3. You ""recover"" highlight data better than using the highlights slider in Lightroom or Camera Raw.4. Blues and greens are boosted without crossing the line into fake-looking.5. My camera auto-focus (Nikon D80) has no problem locking in on any subject with the filter on. Quite the contrary, it seems to me that the outdoor photos are sharper.6. I've experimented taking indoor photos and, although I don't see a dramatic change in the colors or quality or focus, I'm glad to know that I don't HAVE to remove the polarizing filter to do so. (I did try photographing the flat screen TV and the photo did come out better than previous efforts, but ""people pictures"" are not affected one way or the other.7. If there are people, structures, etc. in your outdoor photos, they are not affected unless there is some kind of reflection or glare (or sweat) on them. But skin color does not change.7. Photos taken through glass, even in a moving vehicle, are noticeably better than without a polarizing filter. I'm assuming that the ability to shoot at higher speeds accounts, at least partly, for this.8. Photos of fountains, fish ponds, and beaches are breath-taking.I realize my newby observations will not be of interest to photographers who are veterans of the many benefits of using a polarizer but, in case there is someone who (like me) had failed to take advantage of this amazing tool, hesitate no more.I have owned other screw-on filters before and do notice that this particular brand seems better made. It's like comparing a wine glass that is made of lead crystal to an ordinary wine glass. There is something in the clarity, the weight, the feel that tells you that this is a superior product. I am DELIGHTED to have it and will never miss an opportunity to use it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LJT7TZI0K1QX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R69839S#wasThisHelpful","R1LJT7TZI0K1QX","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband's physical therapist walks behind him using exactly this belt to hold on to him. Now that he's moving more, I got one of these belts, too. I walk behind him with my hand on the belt and, if I feel any unsteadiness I pull lightly. In the case of the therapist, who is a hefty individual who could probably carry my husband from the belt using one hand, I think that this belt which, although it isn't worn tight locks firmly, serves many more purposes than when I use it. I think that the support that I provide is 50% psychological and 50% practical. I may not be able to completely break a fall, but I can support him and help him lean against a wall, re-position his walker and so on because of the grip that the belt provides.

"This is a pretty sturdy and very useful ramp to maneuver someone on a wheelchair into the house and, if you have indoor steps (such as in sunken living rooms) this will also do the trick. It can easily bear the weight of a six-foot, 230 lb man plus his wheelchair. It has little ridges that help traction, especially when going down. This ramp is perfect for one-step obstacles, but if you have two steps the angle is too steep.When ordering a ramp, keep in mind that you need to have space, not only for the length of the ramp, but also to be able to maneuver the wheelchair so you can place it in front of the ramp. (This is about an additional 3 feet, at least.)  Indoors this means moving furniture to clear the approach. If, after studying your particular situation you find that you would have room for the 4-foot ramp, I would seriously consider going for that extra foot. Although this ramp has served me well, I think the 4-footer would have been ever easier.Besides the sturdy construction, I also like the convenience of fold, carry, and store.

"I can't begin to tell you how handy this has been for me recently. My husband broke his quad tendon and had a cast that went from his groin to his ankle for 8 weeks. I don't think I need to go into detail of how a man who suddenly finds himself with a leg he can't bend and weighs a ton feels. For the first 3 weeks, he could put no weight on that leg at all.  He's usually pretty independent and finding himself needing help for everything was a worse punishment than being unable to move. I found myself having to hove around where he was resting because, if I wasn't around when he called, he tried to get up to do it himself. (He fell during one of these ill-advised expeditions). We tried calling each other on the cell phone but either one of us didn't have it with us or a battery was low.This little device is a life saver. He wears it around his neck and I carry the little box to my home office or wherever I am. It's reach is phenomenal. There isn't a place in the house it doesn't reach. The bell is perfectly audible but doesn't make you jump out of your skin.  I finally convinced him that, for MY peace of mind, he should call me and he is going with the program.This is a wonderful device. I wish I'd had it when my mother-in-law was sick. All she had was a little bell and, if no one was nearby, the poor thing had to wait. It would also be great for a sick child, someone recovering from surgery, or anyone else for that matter.

"The word ""dictionary"" is a bit misleading. The only resemblance is that the words appear in alphabetical order and broken down by syllables. Although it doesn't have pronunciation keys, it makes some exceptions with easy-to-confuse words.  It is a list of words you might want to know how to spell (but already know the definition of). The selection of words is quite ample and would probably serve a student up to the 6th grade.

"First and foremost, it's important to note that the criteria for selecting 100 buildings among the millions and millions of available choices is a highly personal one. Had it been up to me , I would not have made the same choices. However, Dan Cruickshank is to be congratulated for having embarked on (and completed!) this difficult and bound to be controversial endeavor.For the most part, I think he did a marvelous job. Not only are all his selections photographed, but there is accompanying text as to why he selected them and what makes them important in the history and evolution of the art (and science) of architecture. From a personal perspective (and that is what a review is supposed to be) every building that I love or consider important is included, so I can't think of a complaint of something he has left out. However, there are some that he put in and that, in his opinion, are outstanding or pivotal structures that I see very little virtue in and consider that the space could well have been filled by something a bit more awe-inspiring. But, since he's the one who wrote the book, his opinion rightly prevails.The book itself is not a coffee table sized book. It fits on a standard book shelf which, I suppose, has its merits. However, the size does impact on the size (and probably number) of photographs. The photographs themselves are adequate, but not outstanding and usually only one photograph appears per entry. The text is smaller than I am comfortable with and the layout, while artistic, is impractical. The outer margin is 2 1/4"" from the edge of the page, but the center margin is about 3/4"" and rounds itself towards the center. The combination of font size and text layout makes reading very uncomfortable. (I should note that this is a general description of the layout. There are some random pages that do allow for a different arrangement of the margins, although the size of the text is consistent throughout.) This last paragraph explains why I deducted one star from the book which, otherwise, is a fascinating and stimulating contribution to the study of architecture.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REKXG2IBX0JP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770855998#wasThisHelpful","REKXG2IBX0JP4","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had this book on my wish list for a long time and hesitated to order it because the idea of D & E being siblings in love with each other rather turned me off. Finally, I decided to take the plunge and I'm very glad I did. It proved to be a very well-written story with just the right amount of angst. Our characters (and the author) handled the sexual tension with decorum and dignity. The secondary plot was well-handled as well, emotionally involving the reader in all aspects of the story.The only thing I could not wrap my head around was Lizzy's anger towards Mr. Bennet. It  was unfair and made no sense at all given how close they had been and how loving he had always been towards her. It didn't mesh well with Lizzy's personality which, otherwise, is pretty close to canon.Luckily, after a convoluted but necessary process, all is resolved more than satisfactorily. And, better yet, you don't have to wait to 90% of the story for the HEA.

"Im very impressed with the Epson Expression ET-2500. It has a ton of good qualities in its favor:--it is a compact unit, does not occupy too much desk space but is still capable of carrying out a full work load.--all the functions are up to Epsons high standards from print quality to scanning capabilities (8.5x11 scan surface).--it has an absolutely STELLAR quality: the ink supply. Not only does it come with a huge supply of ink, but the ink holders are refillable by color. This is a huge savings on two fronts: you have ink to last for thousands of copies and, if you run out of only one of the colors (usually cyan) you dont have to replace a three-color cartridge.--the ease of installation is virtually fool proof. You insert the disk in the computer(s), run the wizard, and it practically does everything for you. NOTE: for installation purposes you do need a USB cable for the first computer in order to set up the wireless network. Subsequent computers dont need the USB cable and, at this point, you can just put it away and operate wirelessly (unless you prefer to use USB). An unexpected bonus: at the end of the process you are issued an e-mail address to which you can e-mail stuff to print from your phone or i-pad from wherever you are.--did I mention wireless? Yes, indeed, it picks up signals from all computers in which you installed the disk (even several rooms away) and also from smart phones, I-pads, etc.--Scanner: wireless is not especially practical for scanning since you have to get up to place the material on the glass, but you can preview and adjust the scan (using the usual Epson interface which is easy to use, even on professional mode) and save from your desk. Then you get up again, to scan the next sheet..--Copier: the same surface on which you scan can be used as a copying machine for 8  x 11 paper.There are a couple of minor details Im not enamored of:--the cover of the scanning/copying surface is made of pretty light plastic. Im not saying its flimsy and it should survive use by adults, but a bit more heft would be reassuring.--the paper supply is exposed to air (sits exposed in the back of the unit), not in a tray. Since I live in Florida and turn off the air conditioning at night and some weekends, the paper is not as well-protected from humidity as it would be in a tray. This is particularly noticeable when you use recycled or 20-lb paper. I am now using only 24-lb paper.--like all Epson scanners it uses a proprietary color profile (EpsonRGB). This is just fine if youre printing to an Epson printer but, if you want to have scanned photos printed at a retailer (say Costco, drugstore, mail order, etc.) you have to remember to convert the color profile to sRGB which is the standard color printing profile for photos and artwork. If you forget, sometimes the color differences are minor and sometimes pretty noticeable. However, when printing to this printer, with these inks, on any paper (but particularly when using Epson photo papers, the photos come out really, really lovely. I particularly like the Epson heavy-weight matte paper.But despite the very minor drawbacks you should really take this unit into consideration. It is a great performer and a very good value. I reiterate the ink consideration: recently it seems printer manufacturers sell you an attractive printer for a lower cost and then, forever, nail you on the ink. I am very happy to see that Epson has taken the initiative of selling a well-priced quality machine with a durable supply of ink (good quality ink, at that) and made the replacement process less frequent and expensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AWQ36O4727ML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JHMG#wasThisHelpful","R1AWQ36O4727ML","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I have to confess that the book was a pleasure to read. It was realistic, in that neither E nor D were perfect and made mistakes, but they admitted them, and they grew and learned from them as normal people do. Other than Lady Catherine and Annabelle, who were a bit over the top, the rest of the characters were balanced and contributed to the story.It was lovely to see E&D's  progress towards their happy ending in a way that was natural, unrushed, and believable--even with bumps in the road.. I was sorry to have the book end and happy to have found a book with sufficient length and depth to keep me entertained for several days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3YD97QRNKV04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ZALYW6#wasThisHelpful","R3YD97QRNKV04","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My old Panasonic 1200 W died after years of intense use and I knew I wanted a similar one. Actually, I like this one better: the controls are more flexible in that I don't have to dial in time in 5 or 10 second intervals. I can press buttons to get whatever time I want (i.e.18 seconds) at whatever power setting I want. Much more flexible.I was surprised that there really isn't a notable difference between 1200W (which is pretty powerful)  and 1250W. I still use the time settings I was accustomed to using for each item. The inside dimensions are pretty large (18.5"" wide), the rotating glass tray is also larger than any I have seen before (16.5""), while the outside dimensions don't really reflect the inside capacity.I've had it for only a month and I really like it, even though it's maybe a bit larger than I need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JBLH143W4UGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CH3A7LU#wasThisHelpful","R2JBLH143W4UGR","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Around the year 2000, I discovered Triple-Flex and have mostly used it ever since. We stayed at a hotel that was near the Spanish Steps in Rome and, after three days of going up and down, I thought the pain in my knees would kill me. The next year we went back to see our son who was spending Junior Year in Italy, stayed in the same hotel, went up and down the same steps, and didnt have a problem. I wasnt more fit, I hadnt lost, weight, I was a year olderthe only difference was my supplementation. I have never again had problems with my knees or other joints, which I find rather amazing for a 67-year old.Sometimes to save money or take advantage of sales, I would try products with only two of the three ingredients and I find that products that include MSM work better than just Glucosamine/Chondroitin alone. This is anecdotal data based on my observations over 15 years. Some studies I read contradict this, but I have proved to myself what works and what doesnt.Part of the reason why Ive looked for an alternative to Triple Flex is that they are large, dry, hard-to-swallow pills. As you get older and your mouth gets dryer, they become even harder to swallow. That is why Im so happy to have discovered this Viva three-ingredient product.Comparing it directly to Triple-Flex (the product Im most familiar with) the most notable difference is that you take 4 capsules of Viva and 2 Triple Flex pills. The daily totals if you follow the recommended dosages also varies a little:2 Triple Flex:  Glucosamine: 1500 mg; Chondroitin: 800 mg; MSM: 750. Sodium: 70 mg.4 capsules of Viva: Glucosamine 1500; Chondroitin: 1200; MSM: 1000. No sodium.I dont think the slight change in formulation is particularly important. What I do consider decisive is that these are capsules, they are reasonably-sized, similarly-priced per serving, but easy to swallow. I think Im sticking with these from now on!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TJ6578P0CPGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STSUPCS#wasThisHelpful","R2TJ6578P0CPGY","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty impressive building set. It's a bit of a stretch to call it ""engineer kit"" since the principles of flight are not an issue, it is pure entertainment value and, at that, it excels. It is rather unique in that it comes with a story book in which the models you can build play a role. As you read along, you build the plane. It is not a one-day & put-it-away type of toy, it creates involvement and identification with the planes and the characters.Regarding the age that is appropriate for the toy, I think that 4 to 6 is ideal because the child can follow along with the story and take an active part in the building of the planes. These are projects which need parental involvement for both the reading (my 6-year old grandson can read a bit, but not enough to read the book himself) and for the building. If left to himself, he would rush in a quest for immediate gratification and not assemble it properly. It isn't difficult and the color coding makes it almost foolproof, but it is a question of 6-year old maturity. The I-pad games have spoiled him a bit, and it's great to have something that motivates him enough to want to put some time and effort into it, but he does need a hint here and there.Another plus is that the finished product looks exactly like in the book and is larger than I would have expected from the illustrations. It's very rewarding to see that all the ""work"" was worth it and a lesson in patience and commitment  The benefits (eye-hand coordination; reading comprehension, following instructions, work in a certain sequence, patience) are all well-disguised as ""playing."" . Everything stores in a neat little chest, which is another plus and, in addition to the illustrated planes a child can build his own creations from the provided parts.I do think it's a shame, though, that this toy was not geared towards an 8-year old age group. That age group could handle the whole process, from reading to assembling alone. But the business of having planes with googly eyes and personalities would probably offend them. At that age they would want something more realistic, less cartoony--more engineering.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB7WABPHUNB90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF8ZQJS#wasThisHelpful","RB7WABPHUNB90","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product has made a noticeable difference to the internet connection to a computer that I have in an addition at the end of the house. I was able to get internet there, but pages were slow to load, downloads were slow to complete, and videos went black (with the little spinning dots) so often I simply didn't watch videos there.I was concerned that the two components were going to be so far away that they wouldn't be able to pair, but pair they did. This is the procedure:1. You get two of the units shown in the photo and two Ethernet cables about 6 feet long.2. You take 1 unit and connect one end to the ethernet cable to the unit and the other to your router then connect it directly to a wall socket (not to a power strip).3. Take the 2nd unit, connect the Ethernet cable to your computer and the other end to the unit. (NOTE: while you're not supposed to connect it to a power strip, I have the computer connected to a battery back up/surge protector and I connected it to that instead of to the wall--it worked).4. Press the ""Pair"" button on both units. There are three little lights on the side and, once all of them have stopped blinking (which happens pretty fast) and stay on solid green, you know they are paired and working.5. It is possible to piggy-back additional units onto this system. You would use the same connection to the router, so each additional set of two units would pair two additional devices to this line. Not a bad deal if you have far-flung devices in the same house, which would include TV's and whatever else you connect to the internet (as long as said device has an Ethernet port).I have found an improvement in the performance of my internet connection. I can watch a whole video on you-tube without having to wait for the connection to catch up (or whatever it was that happened before). I haven't downloaded anything yet, but pages load fast and I have none of those delays in moving up or down the page, I can have a lot of tabs open, and I can switch between them instantly. Also, the computer is now recognizing that other computers exist on my network and that there is a wireless printer several rooms down. Up to now, it was oblivious to them.So, I would say that this is pretty outstanding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I7XFZ76JZ5N4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3QPG1A#wasThisHelpful","R1I7XFZ76JZ5N4","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While designed for a younger baby, I have had great success in using this for my 2-year old granddaughter. It arrived on a day that she was feverish and cranky and refusing to cooperate on everything just for the principle of the thing. She needed to nap and I made a big production of opening the box, placing the batteries in, and turning it on (without ever even glancing at the instructions.) She agreed to be in her crib during this procedure and was immediately fascinated by the light show as soon as I turned off the room lights. I turned on the white noise because she thinks that any music is an excuse to dance and that wouldn't serve my purpose at all. While the fish aquarium is really well done and beautiful, she isn't too impressed since they have a real fish aquarium at her house.This was a godsend because she was not feeling well and in one of those moods where everything is a reason to cry. The light show attraction was just the right thing to distract her from her misery. It is attractive (and well done) enough to capture her attention initially and monotonous enough to lull her to relax and start winding down. The white noise is really necessary in my house, not only because of its calming properties but also because it effectively muffles other noises (including the pool pump which is right outside the window and kicks in at the worst times). The music is sweet and has a music box quality to it that is very lulling. I plan to use it sometimes but, for me, the white noise is a must. It is a watery-sound type of white noise, a little bit more subtle than I would prefer but, probably, just right for a newborn.You can pick the combination of features you want to use (such a lights only, lights + music, white noise + lights, etc.) The only thing I wish was different is that everything you pick works in tandem. It starts out strong and starts winding down until it shuts off completely. I don't mind the lights turning off, but I would like to keep the white noise on at the full level but can't control it independently. If I want to, I can start just that again, but it will just wind down again.  I do have a clock in the room that makes white noise and I have to run it at the same time so the room won't go silent. That wakes her up, she needs some background noise to sleep.I don't know if it is because I was exhausted from taking care of a sick child, or if the lulling effect of the watery light show got to me as well, but I lay down while she quieted intending to leave the room as soon as she fell asleep and I was out like a light. We were both refreshed after our nap.  I just might take this to my room on one of those nights when I wake up at 3:00 am and can't get back to sleep.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PEZJPW6GN4WN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFETDR4#wasThisHelpful","R1PEZJPW6GN4WN","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the product and assume that it does a good job of cleaning open wounds. I love the idea of spray-on versus dab on because it not only is much more convenient and it doesn't push debris or dead skin down into the wound (as dabbing does) it sort of washes it away. I recently took a bad fall and the wound card nurse used a spray-on product which I was unable to find so I ordered this one to have at home. I like her product better because it sprays on like this one does but doesn't sting at all.

"If its possible to feel favorably emotional about a computer, this would be the one to qualify. (I know it is possible to feel unfavorably emotionalto put it kindlyabout a computer!). This one has so many things to get excited about that I am listing them in no particular order:--The graphics card, NVidea GEFore GTX 745 is great. Its approved by Adobe to run Photoshop CC2015 for 3D image rendering and operations requiring Open GL and Open CL. Its also a great card for gamers, according to NVidea.--The Intel 7-core processor is incredible. I had a 5-core in my previous computer and didnt expect to see much differencedo I ever!--It has a 1TB hard drive 7200 RPM and 2 open ports to install to install 2 additional internal drives which I plan to do.--It has USB 3, which Id never tried before and is wonderfuland it has 6 of them, in addition to some USB 2s.--With 16 GB of RAM you can easily process photos from any camera, even those huge 24 and 36 megapixel cameras. You can even have several open at the same time as well as multi-task with other applications. I downloaded creative cloud and Photoshop CC2015, Bridge, & Lightroom. Im in heaven, no matter what I do (and Ive thrown in 3-D and all the heavy filters) I dont have to wait for anything, everything happens instantly. No spinning wheel. I cant believe it.--The computer itself is 17 inches tall, 6.5 wide, and 16 deep. On all counts, a smaller chassis than my previous Dell.--It comes with one optical drives that reads and burns and a program called Cyber Link Media Suite that does much more than I need it to do. If you should want to add an additional optical drive, the space is there.--It also has 4 media slots that, between them can read 19 types of media cards. (I didnt know there were that many!)--It also comes with Microsoft Office Trial which you are bound to have to purchase later, but at least you get a breather while youre buying monitor(s), speakers, etc.--It does come with a basic wired Dell Keyboard and Mouse both of which are basic and perfectly acceptable (though Ive lately grown addicted to lighted keyboards).--It also comes with a one-year Dell support contract (renewable yearly for several years) which is a blessing. Ive had Dells since 1998 and, besides the fact that they are great machines; the tech support is so good I wont get anything else. Between laptops and desktops and between my husband, son, daughter, and sister-in-law, this is the 16th Dell in our householdand never have had a bad apple.--The only thing about the computer about which I am totally unenthusiastic is Windows 8.1 which Ive found horrible and annoying. Microsoft makes decisions that control the way the computer is configured and operates that are different from what Id prefer and Im not given the choice to change them. Its sort of a battle between two control freaks and Microsoft wins. I understand Windows 10 (what happened to 9?) will get the start button back and that should be an improvement. I plan to download it when it becomes available because it just cant be any worseBut, others than Windows 8, this is as close to perfect as Ive ever dreamt of being.

"Im very happy with the UP3. My previous experience was with a Garmin product that had all kinds of software bugs to the point that I couldnt trust any of the readings. This is so much more intelligent and the software is so dependable and user-friendly (without being bossy or controlling) that its a pleasure to use. In no particular order, these are my observations (all positive except the last):--The results are portrayed in text and graphics and the tone of the assessments, no matter how deficient youve been that day, are positive instead of scolding.--The app is very user friendly and keeps a sort of history or time-line in a dashboard like format, and you can compare your activities in order to compare today with better days, etc.--On the upper right it shows a battery and how much its charged. This is important information because, with a device you use round-the-clock, you need to think ahead as to when it would be more convenient for you to recharge. Fortunately the charge lasts more than a week so its easy to plan.--It works very well in conjunction with your smart phone. You dont have to have the phone with you at all times, it syncs when they meet.--Attaching the wrist band is not the easiest process, but it works. You need to be aware of where the sensors are and adjust accordingly so they make good contact. It cant be too tight, but it has to be snug. Its never come off during the day, but Im such a restless sleeper that Ive dislodged it twice at night.--The wrist band is made of a rubbery material and the part with the technology in it is only slightly raised. It tapers up to about  high at the center, which is not bad. Its relatively waterproof for everyday activities, but I take it off to shower. To clean, just use alcohol.--It has some little lights that are only visible when youre charging or changing modes. For example, the blue light clicks on momentarily if youve successfully changed it to track your sleep.--Heart rate tracking only at rest so if youre running or exercising rapidly it doesnt measure that heart rate. When you exercise, you have to tell it what you think you did and it will tell you how many calories it thinks you burned. Since all I do is walk, this is fine with me.--If you swipe from the dashboard, you get a lot of software options. Havent use the stopwatch option, the idle or activity alerts or the alarm clock features, but they are part of the software and a good idea.  Overall, its a very good assortment of options. On this screen it shows your battery time in approximate time left, say about 2 days.--One of the options, the one you click on to switch the mode so it will track your sleep, It gives a pretty thorough report but I cant help but wonder how it knows so much about when Im in REM sleep, etc. When Ive had a sleep study for apnea, they had to put sensors all over my body, including my head. Dont know how exact this measurement is, but its a good guideline and, surprisingly, seems to gibe exactly with my evaluation of how the previous night went.--There are a lot of other apps that are compatible with the UP3, you can set goals, track your calories and weight, upload a photo, etc. The diet tracking can be very techy, you can photograph labels to get real specific about caloric content. Trends is about the only one Ive used because it lets me see (via bar charts) how Ive been doing in terms of steps or hours of sleep over a long period.--I only use it for resting heart rate, steps taken, and sleep monitoring. If it did nothing else, Id be happy but there really are a LOT of options, apps, and modes to choose from. Right now, Im on Weight Watchers and I track my food intake their way.--Ive been using it for several days and I think Ive noticed a flaw in the way it counts steps. If your arm is free it doesnt miss a beat. However, when youre walking in a place where you have to push a cart (Costco, Marshalls, the supermarket, etc.)  and your hand is resting on the cart handle, then the steps dont seem to register. Once you take the cart out to the parking lot and its a bumpier ride then steps do register, but not in the soft glide of the store. You can miss out on hundreds (or thousands) of steps that way. Its pretty impossible to maneuver a cart with only one hand, so the only work-around I can see is to pull the cart with your other hand, but thats pretty uncomfortable. (I had the same problem with the Garmin product I used before).","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZWOAC4TUC3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9E6DUK#wasThisHelpful","RNZWOAC4TUC3O","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These cutters cut pretty well!

Most of my cutting is on setting 4 and the only real way to know if it's time to replace is when the designs become hard to remove or there are skips in the cutting.I'm not employed by Amazon, but I have to say that theirs is the best price I can find.

"Years ago, I had gotten another Swiffer mop kit and was disappointed. The pole in that kit consisted of two metal bars that (I believe) screwed together. This left the pole rather vulnerable in the middle and you couldn't press down very hard because it would arc or bend. From then on, I only used the dry wipes for furniture, etc.This kit is entirely different. The pole is made up of several rigid pieces that secure to each other firmly. There is no bending in the middle, it really feels solid, so I give the design of the pole an enthusiastic 5 stars with no reservations.The dry wipes, which I love for cleaning furniture, tv, shelves, books, just about everything except computers--are a welcome addition to do touch up floor cleaning--especially now that my grandchildren are spending the summer in Camp Babba (that's me). There is always something that needs touch up, especially after meals. With this new non-bending pole they are great, really great for dust bunnies. 5 stars here, too.The wet wipes, which I had never used before, I am a little less enthusiastic about. I have Italian tile floors all over the house, including the kitchen. While they do clean well initially, it seems to me that the floor gets dirty faster after using them. I don't know if it leaves some sort of film or what. I gave them to my daughter (who has wood floors in most of her house) as she has used them in the past and she has no problem on the wood.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUHHF94DKOXUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6FT6TM#wasThisHelpful","RUHHF94DKOXUX","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I hate to be a dissenting voice as so many others just loved the book. I can agree with them that it is well-written, imaginative, and well-edited. It is also of sufficient length to justify the price. I have given it a 3-star rating because, to me, the ""enjoyment"" factor is a vital component in rating a book and I wasn't able to enjoy the book as much as I'd hoped.The reason is that, for the first 93%-94% of the book Darcy is dejected (and rejected). The poor man suffers unrequited love and Elizabeth unknowingly adds to the pain. Then, in the last few screens, everything is resolved (although the thrill factor is somewhat muted). There, frankly, was no reason why it couldn't have been resolved much earlier but, when you consider that the actual book ends at 97% (the rest is coming attractions) we get to enjoy his happiness a very short while.  I guess the author ran out of salt to add to the wound.I realize that any P&P variation has to put Mr. Darcy through the wringer for a while, but this was a bit too much. And, to add insult to injury, there are so few upbeat pages. If she had, at least, elaborated a bit more on the happy times but, no such luck.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19SES9JTIZ1JN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKLDGM0#wasThisHelpful","R19SES9JTIZ1JN","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had ordinary plastic shower curtain rings and, while I didn't mind, I have to admit they did require a hefty yank to get the curtain closed. This sometimes resulted in tearing the first (or last) couple of holes in the curtain. This is a completely different scenario. The rings look great, the ball bearings roll and slide beautifully and you don't have to yank as hard (although old habits are hard to break!).I usually try to balance my reviews with a less-than-stellar quality or something I think could be improved but, truthfully, they look and work great and even after staring at them, then coming back here to stare at the screen, I just can't think of anything I would change.Considering how shower curtain rings are, pretty much, a one-time investment, it makes sense to get the best from the start.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL94NI3DBFNF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00017UT6W#wasThisHelpful","RL94NI3DBFNF3","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If this was any other author, it would rate 5 stars but, for Abigail Reynolds, who has demonstrated in her many previous books that she can do so much better, it is just slightly less than I had been expecting.The premise is interesting and could have worked so much better but the obstacles, misunderstandings, unexplainable interferences, and annoying delays before reaching a satisfactory resolution made reading the book a bit more frustrating than it should have been.

"Not only is this water bottle gorgeous, it is extremely functional, too. There are many things that I love about it:--the color is a deep cobalt blue (one of my favorites)--the capacity is excellent (18 ounces)--the opening is wide enough that I can fill it from the refrigerator water dispenser--the water stays cool a long, long time.--the exterior doesn't sweat, even if the water is ice cold.--the drinking hole is big enough that you don't have to make an effort to drink and small enough that you're not likely to spill (about the size of a nickel)--the lid is easy to screw on and secure.--I have no trouble remembering to take it since I put my car keys inside the lid every night so I can't leave w/o it.--the snap closure is also secure and easy to open and close and unlikely to open by itself.--it fits into my car drink holder and doesn't tip over (surprisingly, since it's so tall).--I'm saving a lot of $$ not buying water bottles every time I'm out shopping in the Florida heat.Is there anything I don't like about it? Not really--unless you count that, although the bottle itself is lightweight, adding 18 oz of liquid to it adds a load to my already heavy purse!(The manufacturer says NOT to carry it around in your purse since something might press on the button that clicks the top open resulting in an spill.

"This ""cooling sensation"" is actually a pretty good idea. I think that my 25 month old granddaughter has finally gotten the idea that she's wetting her diaper. Unfortunately, although she promptly notifies us that her diaper is wet, she still wets it unless, by some miracle, we manage to time the potty stop just right. We are working towards having her identify the feeling that comes BEFORE the coolness.The fact that when she's in childcare 5 days a week there isn't any follow-through on toilet training isn't helping. I believe that during summer vacation when I have her more often and can be more consistent, these trainers will be a big help in making a cause-and-effect connection. At least, between the princess design and the cooling sensation, she's somewhat engaged in the process.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N1L5YIKV32PV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TX1KUSE#wasThisHelpful","R1N1L5YIKV32PV","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This may not be a luxury bathroom set, but it will do just fine for a second bathroom, a dorm or starter apartment.The good qualities are:--its bright and colorful and the range of colors is wide enough that it will go well in most neutral colored bathrooms and with any shade of blue.--the quality is pretty good for the price. The shower curtain is made of polyester, which gives it a bit of a shiny appearance, and the print is just as sharp as you see in the photos.--the matching sink accessories have a matching design which is also sharp and bright.--the lotion dispenser can be used for liquid soap of the non-foaming variety and the pump works just fine.The less stellar qualities are:--the soap holder has drainage holes which, while preventing the soap getting mushy, passes the mush right through to the sink. A two-piece soap holder with a removable bottom would have been better.--the shower curtain has reinforced button holes instead of grommets. Im not sure what that means for durability, but I dont find it promising considering how people seem to yank at shower curtains.--the plastic hooks fit fine in the button holes (as any hooks would). They are of a different design than the usual plastic shower hooks, but dont work any less well or feel more fragile.Neutral notes:--since a toothbrush holder wasnt provided, I use the cup to hold toothbrushes and those tiny paper cups for rinsing. Its much more sanitary anyway.--a clear plastic liner should be purchased before first use to avoid getting the shower curtain wet or soapy. (This is standard procedure, regardless of the quality of the shower curtain, but the liner is not provided in the kit.)--the set has a definite masculine feel to it.

"This toy is as much fun as it looks in the TV commercials. My grandson had been attracted to it when he saw it and I was delighted to have it offered on Vine.Knowing how commercials tend to exaggerate, I was a little skeptical that it could live up to the hype. Surprisingly, it does provide plenty of excitement and the toy functions just as we saw in Nickelodeon. The ring does shoot off the shield with great force.Some of the virtues of the toy, such as the efficient and rapid way it dispatches the star rings can also be faults. It shoots hard and far and high. This is very good from one point of view but it has its downside as well.  Its hard to find the right place to use it without losing a ring or hurting a bystander. Its perfectly safe for the child using it, but it can hurt someone in the way of the projectile or (as happened to us) it can get stuck in a tree or a roof. I was able to get one off the roof using a step ladder and the pool brush but Im waiting for the gardener to come again to get the one that is stuck on our live oak in the front yard.The path of the ring is also a little bit hard to control. The slightest breeze or variation in the angle in which its being held and it swerves off what you expect would be a straight trajectory. The only safe place to stand is behind the child shooting it.This is not a toy to use indoors. The best place Ive found is my brothers back porch which runs the whole width of the house and has nothing breakable and nothing on which the rings can get caught.Another con is that it only comes with two rings. Given their propensity to travel fast and high, it is not unlikely that in the near future one will get permanently lost.But all of the above are adult concerns. My grandson loves it. His friends love it. The construction, functionality, design, and colors are just right. It has been used intensely and often by different children (ages 6 and 7) and a couple of so-called adults and there is no noticeable wear or deterioration. If we manage to hold on to the rings, the toy (and the excitement) should last for a long time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17041WA4PZU7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND5ZWQQ#wasThisHelpful","R17041WA4PZU7B","A2VWE5SGNDS8HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VWE5SGNDS8HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He left the SEALs and is now a mercenary for hire who doesnt think twice about killing.Clara Roberts typically found and retrieved US citizens and got them back home whether alive or dead. She's about to take a leave from her job to go and help her father through his chemo when instead he sends her on a mission into Mexico to find a missing young woman. Her father asks Walker to be her guide and muscle to help. The two embark on a harrowing trek through the Mexican jungle running from banditos and the deadly wildlife of the jungle.Walker goes through quite the transformation through out the book. He's lived for so long looking for the man that killed his brother and killing any bad guys in the way he figured he didnt have a heart left. Clara surprisingly makes his dead heart start beating again and he has to decide what's more important  his need for revenge and not caring about anything or to come back to being a human being that cares about someone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKFCKBG8ZROH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017AQ6I2K#wasThisHelpful","RKFCKBG8ZROH7","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didnt know what to expect from new series from Anne Marie Becker. When I first read what the series was going to be about I was skeptical as it seem like such a huge departure from her previous series. Now that I've finished the book and I can it definitely say  its nothing like her Mindhunter series but I'm hooked and loved it. The characters are not your normal everyday law abiding people. Doesnt mean they dont have good hearts but they defiantly walk a fine line.I love strong heroines that can take care of themselves and Skye Hamilton is definitely that kind of woman. She was raised by men who are anti-government and constantly train for any type of disaster.  She trust no one and is an expert with both guns and knives and hand to hand combat.  She's currently helping a friend look for his missing daughter which bring her face to face with a man who at first seem to be working for the enemy.Jared Bennigan didnt have the greatest upbringing and left for the Army as soon he graduated. This is left his much younger two half-sisters in the care of his reckless mother who ended up dead due to her life style choices. He's now back in Las Vegas working for Global Security Solutions. When one of his sister goes missing he goes in as a bodyguard to one of Hollywood's elite after a clue points to him having knowledge of what happened to her.  Robert Stone is also the man Skye is tracking for the same reason.As the reader we know what's going on and who has the girls and for what purposes. Even knowing this the suspense was still pretty high and there were plenty of secrets that were still left to be revealed as the story went along.Jared was a guy that kept his cool pretty much the whole book and had lots of patients on getting the very non trusting Skye to eventually trust him so they could team up to find the girls together. The final showdown with the bad guys was violent and gory but ohh so satisfying.So to end my review I shouldnt have worried about this new series because it was just as captivating as her previous one. Looking forward to future books in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8HZ4PQS9Y6HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EK3ZFS#wasThisHelpful","R8HZ4PQS9Y6HY","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Right after a spur of the moment decision to marry the girl is devastated by something her husband does and runs away for 6 years.After six years she comes back for a divorce and winds up finding out the truths about both families and boy are they shocking revelations.The name of the series is The Syndicate so that should give you a clue that this is about the Mafia so that shouldn't be a spoiler.

BUT once the secret is out from that point on I loved the book. It became the type of love story I've come to love from Kristen Ashley. The only parts I liked with the flashbacks was getting to see how the club was 23 years ago when Crank was the president of Chaos. It was cute getting to meet Tabby when she was just a little girl and getting to see a little of the brothers that were now dead but have been talked about through out the other books. Long time enemy of the Club, Benito Valenzuela is back still trying to stir up trouble for Chaos.So the last 65% of the book gave a great story with plenty of laughs from the women, plenty of hot lovin between Millie and Logan, little bit of suspense and some interesting developments on some possibly future stories..  So all in all I enjoyed most of the book and very curious to see whose story is next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S31YV298WIOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3E76II#wasThisHelpful","R2S31YV298WIOA","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a great love story. I would never have thought a story could be written about two broken people and it not be over the top in angst or drama but Aly Martinez has written that story in The Fall Up.This books deals in some serious subject matters, suicide, mental illness and depression. You would think that would mean a sad story but it wasnt. It was uplifting that two people ended up being the shining  light the other was lacking in their lives and gave each other the confidence to face past and current demons and to do what takes to become healthy so they can start their journey to happiness together.This books was a perfect blend of romance, healing, and laughter with a perfect ending.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VR3ZBSTTMXKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0176JLJDE#wasThisHelpful","R2VR3ZBSTTMXKY","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Secrets, lies, betrayal and shocking revelations are just a part of what goes on in this latest from Pamela Clare.I've come to expect a great story from Ms Clare but knowing what she went through during the writing of this book makes it that much more amazing.To keep from accidentally divulging any spoilers all I am going to say is everything you thought you knew about Holly Bradshaw from all the previous I-Team books is wrong. The hero is this one is someone we had not met before, Nick Andris who works for the CIA and in reading this book my feelings havent changed about the CIA  shadiest group of people that always has a traitor or two in its mist.I've enjoyed all the I-Team books and this was no exception.

"Slower paced and more time spent with character development than in peril but still a solid 2nd book in the series.The Biological Response Team is still searching for the terrorist that wrecked havoc in the first book. This time up its Sophia Perry who is a virologist and hematologist. Sophia had leukemia as a child and even though she went into remission now her bone marrow has stopped producing. She figures she is on borrowed time and wants to do one last big thing before she dies. She gets that chance when the terrorist unleashes a new bio weapon.Connor Button is the latest Special Forces soldier to be assigned to the BRT. He was the sole survivor of an IED blast that killed all of his team. He too is looking for one last big mission to put himself in harms way in hopes of it also taking his life. What he didnt count of was the young genius he was assigned to.  During their time getting to know each other and after being deployed to the latest site of the biological strike two people who didnt figure they would live long lives come to find a reason to want to live.There is one more book in the series which will hopefully wrap up catching the terrorist and will give us the head of the  Biological Response Team story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38ETZSYFR0EDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VYD2FA0#wasThisHelpful","R38ETZSYFR0EDW","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fast paced, intense suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end. I think this book has the highest body count I've ever read. Its like watching the Walking Dead, no one is safe.Having read my fair share of Military romantic suspense I was pleasantly surprised to find this series  goes a step further and incorporates bioterrorism and the Biological Response Team who does their best to make the world safe from the terrorists that use it.The book takes place in Afghanistan where Grace Daniels is both a trauma surgeon and on a Biological Response Team.  She has seen the ugly side of war from all sides and its definitely left its mark on her soul. She has become best friends with one of the men assigned to keep her safe and when a village is completely wiped out from an anthrax these two have to depend on each other to not only keep themselves alive but to also stop a terrorist bent on revenge.Once I started this book I couldnt put it down until I'd finished it. The action is non-stop and every situation was intense. Looks like I've found a new author and series to read and cant wait to start the next book in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VT0RTXWXRYD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQDB6LI#wasThisHelpful","R1VT0RTXWXRYD1","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a journey this series has been. The search for a killer finally comes to a conclusion and in the fashion of how this author has written this series it is not done in an orthodox way.There is nothing more sweeter as a reader to not know the journey I am about to take when starting a book. This series took you places you never expected to go, blew your mind a time or two and if you have the tendency to side more on the twisted side of thinking this ended will satisfy all your cravings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HCCY923OA5QL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016H2ALV2#wasThisHelpful","R3HCCY923OA5QL","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every once in a while you see something come across your news feed that catches your attention. This was that book for me. The title  the blurb and even the reviews drew me in. The two main characters are 17 and still in high school but have known each other since grade school. Delilah Blue has been away for 7 years after punching two bullies that were picking on a boy she was crushing on. Her family then sent her off to a all girls boarding school. Now she is back home and attending public school where she runs into her childhood crush Gavin Timothy again. Delilah has some weird fascinations, one being  medevil torture devices and other morbid things and she doesnt really care what anyone thinks of her. Her crush on Gavin who was always known as the weird boy who lived in a even weirder house hasnt lessoned any during her time away. Now that she's older she decides she is going to rekindle their friendship in hopes that it turns into more.On the surface this was a funny budding romance between two quirky people who just fit together. Once the story got going we saw that Gavin had a strange childhood. He wasnt raised by a person  he was raised by a House. For a short while you think ok that's creepy but what a cool concept. Well House doesnt like to share and we come to find out that if you make House mad bad things can happen.**SPOILERISH**The big showdown between Delilah and the House was cool when she pulled out her inner Buffy and kicked ass. There is a shocking revelation towards the end but we never really find out why the House was the way it was.  END SPOILERThis was an entertaining read and if your looking for something spooky to read around Halloween I'd recommend this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J9X8N2SFRR27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBKYLBY#wasThisHelpful","R3J9X8N2SFRR27","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This had all the elements you expect from Jill Shalvis and the Animal Magnetism series. Plenty of humor, great sexy banter between the H/h and plenty of cute animals. Along with the things you've come to expect it also surprisingly had a good deal of time spent on a suspense plot which gave this more of a romantic suspense feel than just a contemporary romance which was a bonus for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5UR1IS6TPXHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI026L0#wasThisHelpful","R5UR1IS6TPXHG","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This author never ceases to take me on an emotional roller coaster ride with every book she writes. This series has never had any conventional romances. She always takes two people who couldnt be more different from everything from looks to moral values to where and how they were raised but yet as the story progresses you see along with the characters they are perfect for each other.Shane Rydell never felt like he fit in with his family even though he loved his brother dearly. They were raised on a cattle and horse ranch and horses were never his thing. His father was a little rough on him due to this which in turn made Shane once he was old enough leave for months at a time on his Harley. Shane answered to no one and he did what he wanted no apologies. He was happiest when he was fixing old tractors or cars or motorcycles. Give him something electronic and he'd tinker with it. He also didnt believe in relationships. He unapologetically slept with who he wanted whether they were married or not and his conscience was clear because he wasn't the one cheating. His view on life and how he lived it came to a screeching halt once he has to attend his nephews parent/teacher conference when his brother is away on his honeymoon.I look at this book as two parts. The first part was the restoration of Shane's conscience by Allison Gray who is an elementary teacher with aspirations of helping others with reading disabilities. She has a strong moral compass and doesn't hesitate in telling Shane his selfish actions have the potential to harm innocent people. As Shane starts to finally feel in his heart again and look at his actions your heart breaks for him when even his own family has a problem believing the drastic change. The second half of this book is Allison Gray's story. Shane knew right away he loved Allison but he had no idea of the deep rooted emotional pain she was hiding. I'm not going to get into what that was but it rips your heart out a time or two or three.Unknowingly Allison made Shane into a better man which she in turn would need to help her move past some traumatic issues.There was one other thing that was very special to see during this book. In the first book in the series the heroine was illiterate and had suffered because of her never being able to learn to read. Allison knew she suffered from dyslexia that had gone undiagnosed for more than 26 years and through Shane's urging convinced Allison to get educated and certified to teach Erin how to conquer her disability and finally learn to read. Nothing is ever easy for any characters in any of Leanne's books but love and determination eventually get these characters the happiness they finally deserve.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J2HY5JO087QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0113F0UNC#wasThisHelpful","R2J2HY5JO087QH","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: Reading Until July should be done before reading this one as it literally picks up after a rescue done at the end which involves the heroine of this book.The Until Her/Him series consist of the children of the Mayson men from Until series (which I also recommend reading). When Jax Mayson rescues Ellie Anthony  along with his cousin July from human traffickers he experiences the BOOM.  Fans of the series know what the boom is  for those that dont all the men know immediately when they've met the one. Ellie was that one for Jax.Ellie didnt have a good home life and could only depend on her brother but when he and the mother of his daughter are killed in a car accident Ellie becomes the guardian to their infant daughter Hope. Hope is now 3 and she about steals all the scenes in the book.Along with the love story there is also the wrapping up of the human traffickers and also a surprise ending to some thing from Jax's parents book Until Lilly. Plenty of teasers too about the other Mayson kids stories which I cant wait for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA3PEV9V50H94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015EPMZ0I#wasThisHelpful","RA3PEV9V50H94","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HIDDENHang on to your hats - there is a new suspense sheriff in town. I can not express how much I loved this book. I am a huge fan of Karen Rose and when I saw her recommend this author I didn't even think twice just bought it and started reading.From the opening scene until the last, the words just flowed. The author flawlessly takes us on a journey that spans the course of 11 years.There are many cast of characters. The sole surviving victim of the Co-ed Slayer who had murdered nine female students 11 years before. Lacey Campbell barely escaped but her best friend was taken and never heard from again even after he was caught and sentenced to death based on her testimony. She is now a forensic odontologist examining teeth and bones for the state Medical Examiner and is shocked when called to a scene to help identify bones that were found under an apartment that they are the bones of her friend that was taken all those years ago.Jack Harper is a ex-police officer who happens to own the property that the remains are found on. Before Lacey figures out that the bones are of her friend there are some sparks that fly between him and Lacey. Jack who used to date one of the murdered college women and was questioned as a suspect back then and comes under the scrutiny of the press again after the body was found on his property.Michael an investigative reporter who is also Lacey ex-boyfriend and best friend doesn't like Jack and when he sees there's an attraction between Lacey and Jack he runs Jack through the ringer in the paper. But his first and only goal is keeping Lacey safe and that common tread eventually make Jack and Michael allies.Mason Callahan and Ray Lusco are with the Oregon State Police Major crimes and play a big part through out the story.Then we have our sick and twisted killer. Who could this killer be that is going after all the people that put the Co-ed Slayer away. It cant be him as he died in prison.I live to read books like this. I love the suspense and getting into the mind of the killer and watching the quest to hunt the killer down from every person from the Hero to the police.CHILLEDAs with the first book the author flawlessly takes us on a journey where the words just flow.There are a lot of characters that we bounce back and forth with. A search and rescue team is assembled to go into the Cascade Mountains to search for survivors of a plane crash. On board the plane were two pilots, a US Marshal and a serial killer.Sheriff Patrick Collins rounds up his SAR crew who are Jim Wolf and Thomas Todoroff, deputies with the Sheriff's ofc, Ryan Sheridan a cop from another county and Brynn Nealey (our heroine) who is a forensic nurse who goes along in case someone is hurt. At the last minute they get a call that a US Marshal is going to be joining them in there search. Alex Kinton (the hero) has lied his way onto the search team to search for his brother's killer to make sure he is either dead or reprehended.The other characters are the serial killer Darrin Besand and Alex's old boss Paul Whittenhall.We are lead from here on a chilling trek through the forest through freezing temps and snow. We learn about each of the rescue crew along the way. Alex after losing his brother and putting away the man who killed him and then eventually losing his job had done nothing for the past year but drink and take pills. He thought he was emotionally dead inside and struggles for most of the trip to find the plane about his attraction to Brynn and eventually to caring about everyone on the team.BURIEDKendra Elliot has written her best book to date and shows why this series is called bone secrets.Twenty years ago a school bus with nine children and the driver just vanished. Two years later one survivor walked out of the Cascade Mountains with no memory and near death.Now it is eighteen years later and a grisly discovery has been made. They have found the mass grave of the children and others that were not on the bus but one child is still unaccounted for, that is our hero Michael Brodys brother.Fans of the series will remember Michael from the first book as the intense reporter ex-boyfriend of forensic odontologist Lacey Campbell. He is just as intense in this book in his quest to find out what happened to his brother and why his bones are not with the others. This quest leads him to the sister of the lone survivor who he now desperately wants to talk to. But Chris Jacobs has been in hiding and no one knows where he is. Jamie Jacobs is a principal and needs to have order in her life since her brothers abduction and return. She cant just up and leave at the spur of the moment even if it is to help find her brother. That is, until she is attacked by why looks to be the man that tortured her brother all those years ago.Mason Callahan and Ray Lusco with the Oregon State Police Major crimes are also back in this book and these two are such a hoot together.This was a heartbreaking tale especially since it dealt with children. The author did a fantastic job of taking us through the discovery, the ME reports and the investigation on who had done this and a few other big twist that lead up to a shocking ending.VEILEDJack and Lacey are back. We met these two in Kendras first book Hidden. They are at a resort scoping it out as a possible wedding venue when they find themselves in the middle of a murder investigation when a woman in a wedding dress is found floating in the resorts hot tub.Even though this was a novella sized book we still got a good murder mystery to follow from all aspects  the interrogations to the autopsies. One thing Jack and Lacey cant do is walk away from a murder and when they find out Jacks old partner is the Chief of Police in the small town they decide to hang around and help solve the murder. Jack and Lacey work well together and are even closer after everything they went through in Hidden. It was great to get to revisit them again and follow them along on the investigation that has a few surprises along the way.ALONEMy final thoughts as I finished this book were this was a great example of overcoming adversity. The heroine, Victoria Peres overcame many during her life and as the book goes on you realize this woman really beat the odds.Weve met Victoria in previous books. She is a forensic anthropologist that has been nicknamed the ice queen and bone lady. She is perceived as being anti-social and unfeeling. But that is not the case and her walls begin to crumble at the site of a mass murder of young girls when one of the reasons she sealed off her emotions, Seth Rulledge, shows up at the scene as one of the candidates for the medical examiner job that would make him her boss. Seth and Victoria were college sweethearts whose romance ended in heartbreak but Seth has vowed to make up for that now and hopes to win Victoria back.The investigation of the murder of the young girls and its eerie similarity to one from the 60s is treaded throughout the book with plenty of fascinating information on how a forensic anthropologist finds out who a person is just from bones and the inner workings of an autopsy but it was also a character story of how people overcome a bad childhood, relationship heartbreak and traumatic events to still succeed in life by being persistent and resilient and not letting circumstances or events knock them down for long and that in the end love, inspiration, faith and patience can finally pay off.Mason Callahan and Ray Lusco with the Oregon State Police Major crimes are also back in this book and as always are a joy to read as they try to solve the case.It may not seem like it from what Ive written so far but this book did have plenty of suspense. From the moment the girls are found lying in a field all in white dresses and arranged in a perfect circle to the atrocious revealing of why, you are turning the pages and gasping as each clue is revealed.I am never disappointed by Kendras stories and that was no different with Alone. I look forward to the next book from her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RSVTGHJYCU5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015THB084#wasThisHelpful","R2RSVTGHJYCU5U","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"VanishedThe combined elements of a murder mystery and kidnapping of a young child make up this psychological thriller that deals with danger more on a mental level rather than a physical one.Mason Callahan is a character weve met in previous books in the series. He and his partner Ray Lusco are with the Oregon State Police Major crimes division and have been instrumental in solving cases in the previous books. Mason has always been a fascinating character and I was thrilled to learn this book was going to be about him. Weve only got to see the work side of Mason  even though thats all Masons life really is about  so it was nice to finally get to know the man behind the cowboy hat.While I was reading this it came to mind more than once what on earth Mason had done to the author to warrant her putting this poor man through the mental anguish she did in this book. But that makes for good reading and she didnt just stop with him, the heroine FBI Special Agent Ava McLane, who was part of the team working to find the girl, certainly had her fair share of mental anguish too. I really liked Ava, she was good at her job and had great insights and was able to separate personal issues from the job which was something Mason wasnt able to do in this book.There was a large cast of characters in this one along with many facets of the FBI including the Child Abduction Rapid Deployment (CARD) Team which was fascinating to learn about. They deploy teams of experienced personnel to provide on-the-ground investigative, technical, and resource assistance to state and local law enforcement when a child is abducted. There was obviously a lot of homework done in the writing of this book and it really showed. I was captivated from page one and of course was rooting for my man Mason to get his HEA and some peace of mind.BridgedAs a lover of romantic suspense I always find its a sign of good writing when I find myself feeling sympathy for the killer. Now that doesnt always happen as some are just too sick and twisted to relate to but the killer in Bridged is one I found myself understanding his reasonings behind what he was doing.This second book in the series picks up a few months after the firsts one. Mason and Ava are now practically living together and making their relationship work even with the stresses of their two jobs. His as a detective with the Oregon State Police and she is a FBI agent. The work collides with the death of a man found hanging naked on a bridge.I liked how the author writes about the equal balance of home and work between these two. Mason and Ava have always been dedicated to their jobs but balancing a relationship between that is new to both of them and I thought they did a great job of it. No egos got in the way between them as it was clear they respected the other and the work each does.This was a good mystery as to why the killer was doing what he was doing and the reveal slow as to what the main motive was. As the book went along your thoughts on the victims certainly changed.I always enjoy the stories Kendra has to tell and this was no exception. Im looking forward to whats next in this series from Mason and Ava..SpiraledHold on to your seats for this one. Literally starts off with a bang and youre on a adrenaline filled ride to the end. Ava McLane has gotten herself in the middle of chaos again.Its been 8 months since Ava and Mason met and their relationship has sure been filled with intense situations that would test any new relationship but Mason has proven hes in it for the long haul. Ava is supposed to be on vacation from her job with the FBI but instead finds herself in the middle of mass shooting at the local mall. This isnt the first mass shooting recently and before long there is another. Mason and Ray get assigned to the task force to figure out whats going on and of course Ava cant just sit on the sidelines.There are many twist and turns throughout the investigation with some shocking revelations. Ava is brought to her breaking point not only with the shooting but also by her sister Jayne. Avas twin is such a pain as a reader I want to just strangler her for what she puts Ava through. Another great story in the Mason and Ava series and I hope the love these two have for each other continues to hold strong through all their trials and tribulations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OA64L7COGL6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TW5HS8#wasThisHelpful","R2OA64L7COGL6T","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The impression you have of what the book is about in the first chapter is not at all what you get by the end. There are so many twists to the story that were slowly revealed until a surprise ending.

"Part 1Wow.. This is one of THOSE books. The kind that leaves you speechless at the end and still thinking about it hours and even days later.Its so hard to write a review about a book like this because its an experience book. You as a reader need to experience every single thing yourself as your reading it. To talk in depth about this book would give away to many spoilers. But its soo worth the read.My best advice is to read the blurb.. Id like to give you a few warnings but I wont. Well maybe one  plenty of explicit sex.. And a mind blowing ending.I also want to say the cover for this book is 100% spot on. So many covers dont accurately depict the characters but once you read the book and then look back at the cover, its telling you a story all in itself.Part 2This is the conclusion to Contrite which was such a phenomenal dark and twisted book. There were things I was happy with in this book and things I was disappointed in. Contrite was such a rush  like an extreme high and Reprisal was so mellow in comparison.I still recommend reading this series as Contrite was one of the best books Ive read this year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VFA0WXX7MKF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BN27BA#wasThisHelpful","R2VFA0WXX7MKF6","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading this I have come to realize that I have issues with this type of story line. So take my 3 rating and review with a grain of salt. When the lead is a reporter for most of the book they are lying or conniving to get that story. Shelley Jackson finds the body of a friend who she briefly dated in an ally where he had asked her to meet him about evidence of corruption at a large company. For someone she should have care about all she was really interested in was finding on his dead body that evidence and then left him in that ally. Yes she called 911 but it was still a cold thing to do.Jason Mallory is the dead man's step brother and feels guilt over his brother death as he was getting the information for him. Jason is a rich businessman who knows Shelly is keeping secrets about what happened to his brother. As these two eventually team up to find out who killed him a few more bodies pile up and they also start a sexual relationship.Even though I had issues with Shelley's moral character she was a tough woman and I loved how she kept one upping a sleazy fellow reporter. The writing was good and the middle part of the book kept your interest but then we get to the ending. Shelly did a 180 and become a Scarlett O'Hara  begging Jason to not leave her and vowed she would get him back. The switch from strong tenacious reporter to sniveling love struck woman was hard to swallow.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SA07PXWJ3AMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01228ED78#wasThisHelpful","R2SA07PXWJ3AMM","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I applaud authors who want to step out of their normal writing box and write something that's shocking, dark and very taboo. But there is also a risk of either the subject matter or story being a little out of the comfort zone of the reader.The author wastes no time in introducing the shocking and taboo parts of the book in the first chapter. If you can stomach the first chapter the rest until the end isn't so bad. One thing I am not a fan of putting a character through hell giving them a tiny glimpse of normal and then yanking it from them again at the end for reasons that really dont make sense.Something I had not seen before was the author gave us two epilogues so you can decide how you wanted it to end. I got how the heroine could go either way but after reading the book I was left very unsatisfied with all the outcomes. For me where it went wrong was the last chapter before the epilogues.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY5TEP1RERZDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0150BUWLK#wasThisHelpful","RY5TEP1RERZDF","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Its always sad when a series comes to an end but the author always gives us such great epilogues that in the end you feel happy for all the great couples we've met over the course of this series.The last couple up in the 'Berg series are two people that have been in the background since the first book. Cher (Cheryl in previous books) was the Bohemian brash bartender who unfortunately had dated and been deceived by a serial killer. Afterwards her and son changed their last names to stay out of the limelight. Cher is not a conventional mother but she loved her son deeply and did whatever she needed to do that make sure he had a good life growing up. Through out the years she's watched her friend Garrett Merrick mourn over his marriage while having a crush on him. One night when Merry was drowning his sorrows in a bottle of boos Cher decides to lay it out for him about his ex wife and the two end up getting drunk and having a wild night of sex.Garrett is a Lieutenant with the local police department. He and his sister both didn't deal well with the tragic murder of their mother years ago. Her death left them both with inner demons that sabotaged any personal relationships. Rocky finally got her issues worked out with Tanner but Merry was still stewing in his until Cher opened his eyes to maybe its wasnt all on him on why his marriage didnt work out and that maybe his friend Cher was the woman who would give him back his soul.All the previous cast of characters are back in Hold On and along with the romance there are a few suspense plots running through the story. One of the things I've really enjoyed about this series are the characters are in their late 30's to early 40's and some already have kids they are coming into the relationship with along with pasts that need to be worked through. Even though the characters are sometimes over the top and of course fictional they are written to where you feel like these are people you could know in real life and can relate to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VFOYHGENFCFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692467459#wasThisHelpful","R1VFOYHGENFCFN","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A much deserved second chance at love for a man who weve seen in so much pain throughout this series since his wife was tragically gun down in front of BKI headquarters 2 years ago.Dan Currington drowned his grief in a bottle. He had lost his will to live. But with the help of his friends and AA he has come back to the land of the living. Two months ago on a fateful mission in Kuala Lumpur he met Secret Service Agent Penni DePaul. They had an immediately chemistry which surprised Dan but when a bomb takes out the rest of Pennis team they part ways.Dan and Dagan Zoelner have been in Peru for the last 3 months along with CIA agent Chelsea Duvall trying to catch the CIA traitor that was in part responsible for the bombing in the last book. Dan hasnt been able to get Penni off his mind and is shocked when she shows up saying she needs to talk to him. The action takes off from here and the 4 of them find themselves dodging bullets before managing to get out of Peru.As with all of the books in this series there are overlapping story arcs throughout the books along with the setting up of the next couple. It was great to finally get to see Dan get some happiness back in his life and I liked how the author handled still honoring Dans deceased wife along with allowing him to find love again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q8VQ0FQ9CDP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X648S1A#wasThisHelpful","R2Q8VQ0FQ9CDP4","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hatfields and McCoys got nothing on the Parkers and Bainbridges. Knox Parker and Felicity Bainbridge are from two families that hate each other. Regardless of this they fall in love as teens. But the Bainbridges wont have their daughter soil their name by being with a Parker and Knox pays a horrible price for loving Felicity.First off I have to say I loved that we got alternating views through out this whole book. Knox's were in the present and Felicity's were the past to start off with. Some of the books in the series have only been one POV and the alternating in this one blending past and present leading up to a horrible climax made the story work very well.Knox wasnt a character we had met before this book. How the author introduced him to the gang of the previous book was heartwarming and I have to say Pick has certainly become quite the matchmaker. Felicity was friends with many of the girls from the previous books and worked at Pick's bar. Knox didnt think he had any connection to any of group that he worked with at the bar but as the author unfolded his story that was not the case.As with all the Forbidden Men books at the core there is a great love story but this group of friends have all gone through hell before either meeting their soul mate or met them young and circumstances tore them apart until fate brought them back together again.Knox and Felicity story went through so many emotional stages. The young lovers thought despite their families hatred that their love for each other would be enough. And in a way it was even with all the hell that Knox went through and losing so much that it changed him to a angry man he still never stopped loving Felicity even though he didnt think himself worthy of her anymore. Felicity walked away from her family's and their fortune at 18 and never looked back even with her struggling financially. She never though she'd ever get a second chance with Knox and when he came back into her life unexpectedly she wasnt going to let him push her away even with all the demons he was fighting within himself.Asher's story is finally up next and boy does the author leave us with a bit of a cliffhanger about his story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VU9AP3Y2F0BB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012EI55FA#wasThisHelpful","R2VU9AP3Y2F0BB","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You just have no idea what this author is going to come up with in her books and its guaranteed to either shock you or give you the heebee jeebees where your going Oh My God she didnt just go there.Now with that being said I cannot tell you what gave me that moment in this book as it would be a spoiler of course <grin> but its still making me go ICK ICK ICK. I didnt think she could top the ickyness of the necrophiliac in the last book but she totally did.A lot of suspense authors (in my opinion) have gotten into a cookie cutter format and you feel that you've read that before or you can totally guess what's going to happen  no originality. I am here to tell you that after reading 10 books from this author she still has the power to surprise me with what her mind comes up with.If you haven't read this author and love romantic suspense with some of the sick and twisted killers I highly recommend you read her CORE series  all of them!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V2BF28QZAE5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GSX3RS#wasThisHelpful","R1V2BF28QZAE5R","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series has been full of emotions. The Stockton brothers had such crappy childhoods that it left big scars on their souls and none thought they were worthy of love. Its taken women who are just as broken as they are to heal their hearts and the journey is all the sweeter as each couple has helped the other heal on their way to finding that lasting love.Who doesnt like a bad boy on a Harley. From the moment we met Zane Stockton in the first book he had me intrigued and looking forward to his story. He and Taylor were just perfect for each other. Two people so in need of love and affection but yet scared to death of it at the same time.Though we only got 3 of the Stockton brothers stories in this trilogy there are many more of them out there and I hope the author plans to continue the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VOPWT9HNLA9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDCSI0K#wasThisHelpful","R1VOPWT9HNLA9P","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I liked this story about a active Navy Seal trying to find his sister that had went missing. Kevin Rimshot Stanton just couldn't get over her disappearance that had yealded no clues as to what happened to her. His father didn't really seem to care and he was at loose ends on who to contact to help. One night out with his team mates its mentioned he should hire Jaime Hensen a local PI who is known to find even the impossible. Rimshot's never forgotten the one time he met Jamie which was at his friends wedding which they both walked away from without acting on their attraction.Over twenty years ago Jamie's older sister went missing. Jamie has made it her life's goal to find her or at least what happened to her and went on to college to become the best tracker she could. When Kevin comes to her wanting her help to find his sister she was both happy to take the case and to finally get to act on the feelings they had at the wedding.Right up until the end I enjoyed the story and was curious as to what happened to Kevin's sister. I never dreamt we'd also get to find out what happened to Jamie's sister too. The last chapter is where I realized the author tied in a story that was started in another series of hers. It kind of took me out of the story a little as that series is a paranormal series and without having read it was a little confused. Other than that I really enjoyed Rimshot's Hard Target.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGMW20VU1Q1PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0134EZ990#wasThisHelpful","RGMW20VU1Q1PC","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He decides to help her out and offer to drive her their.What neither of them knew until the long drive through a snow storm was their lives were connected by Kimberly's dead husband who was a bad man and whose father was even worse.This was more suspense than romance as the majority of the story is Brier and Kimberly revealing their story  the common thing that connected them  on the drive and the suspense would they ever be safe from her son's grandfather.

"First off that cover is hot isnt it? And the man inside the book was just as sexy. Mason Steele is feeling a little sorry for himself when he's forced out of the SEALs by a heart issue he'd developed. Having to do guard duty for a spoiled rich businesswoman who carries a dog everywhere is not where he saw his life ever going. Pansy Hightower has no idea who this huge hunk of a man is that has been following her but she is grateful he was when she is kidnapped and taken to the desert to be killed and buried.I liked both of the characters even with the super fast tracked romance that had to happen. My only little pet peeve was his calling himself a bedroom Dominate but yet at the start of the book we see him feeling sorry for himself and then when the first bedroom scene happens he is hemming and hawing when trying to explain to Pansy his dominant preference. That does not scream Dom to me. Other than that for the shortness of the book it was sexy and had just enough suspense to keep your attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M69ILZP0YM89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0134EZ9AY#wasThisHelpful","R2M69ILZP0YM89","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

J.M.'s military stories are always very emotional but the subject matter she tackled in this one and how she had her main characters deal with it was  I just cant think of the right word  but it makes you FEEL!!Trying to describe this book in a normal review would give away a lot spoilers.

"Right from the start you see that this heroine can take care of herself. First chapter of this book has Dana Markham kicking ass and not bothering with names.Dana and her 10 yr old son have been on the run for years from her ex husband who is dirty in many ways. She's learned that she can depend on no one but herself to stay alive as the FBI has fumbled more than once. In the latest attempt by her ex husbands hire killers to kill her and take their son she manages to kill all but one and that one turns out to be an undercover FBI agent who ends up taking responsibility for Dana and her son by going on the run with them.I didnt realize until about half way into this that I had read this years ago under another name. I take it since the cover and name of the book have changed its a complete reboot. I only say this to those who may have read the first book Dark and Dangerous (which is no longer available). If you haven't read that book then I recommend Dead Run. This was a fairly fast paced read with like I said a very exciting opening and two people who fall in love while on the run with lots of great scenes with her son and their very protective dog.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TZEQZMAD3I3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VS4K0QQ#wasThisHelpful","R1TZEQZMAD3I3Q","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Stockton boys sure tug on the heartstrings. I figured from the first book that Steen's story would be the most heartbreaking and it was. All of the brothers lived through hell in their childhood years but from that pain forged a tight bond between them. That past also made them leery of women and they each vowed to never marry or let a women ever get close enough to hurt them. Steen was the exception to this as he never felt he forged the tight bond with his half brothers and doesnt think he is the one worthy of love from a good woman.In the last book we knew Steen was in prison and had stepped in front of a knife to save a fellow inmate. It wasnt looking like he was going to make it until his brothers fiance whispered to fight to live because there is a woman out there who needs him and was waiting just for him. When this book starts Steen is getting out of prison still mending from his wounds and even though he was in a coma the words she spoke are still on his mind. When he meets a woman from his childhood he realizes she is as broken as he is and thinks his reason for not dying is to make sure she gains the confidence she needs in herself to move past the damage her parents and ex husband have caused her. He never once thinks he is deserving of anything. But as their time together progresses he see's that maybe he got it wrong she would be the one to save him  to make him see that he did deserve love just as much as she did.This story was just these two spending time together and slowly revealing their painful past to each other. No big suspense plots or action scenes, just two lonely people connecting and learning to forgive themselves for their past mistakes. The author does a great job of just pulling you into their grief and making you feel for them and want to see them finally get that piece of happiness they deserve.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JGU1K3SK4Z59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUPYSI2#wasThisHelpful","R1JGU1K3SK4Z59","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dangerous Waters (Vancouver Island - Carver Brothers #1)Great small town murder mystery with lots of twist and a romance.Opens with a shocking murder that happened 30 years ago and then goes to present day where another murder has happened. The story takes place in a small remote town in Canada. After two divers find a body underwater Sergeant Holly Rudd of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and her team arrive to investigate. Holly's father is a commanding officer with the RCMP and she always felt she had to prove herself. This was her first time being in charge of a homicide by herself and she wants to make her father proud. She is still smarting over getting involved with a staff sergeant who forgot to inform her he was married.Finn Carver, one of the divers who discovered the body has an ugly history with the little town. After serving many years in the special forces he comes back to town when the man who raised him is beat to within an inch of his life.He and Holly have an instant attraction but neither want to be, but they are constantly thrown together during the investigation. As the investigation goes along we see that the town is pretty good at keeping and hiding secrets. And there is a doozy of a one being kept hidden.I really like all the twist and turns during the investigation. The author kept you on your toes as to who was bad and who was doing what with whom.I was excited to here that Finn's brother will be getting his own book next. After you read this book you will see why he deserves his own book.Dark Waters (Vancouver Island - Carver Brothers #2)The author takes us on deeply sentimental journey of gritty realities with two resolute and courageously scarred characters.Right from the prologue you are thrown into a conspiracy of intrigue. When a father whos ex-wife and daughter doubted his innocence when he was convicted of crime many years ago and served 5 years hard time for it finds himself in trouble again he manages to send a message to his daughter to go to the only man he trust, Brent Carver his cell mate from prison, for protection.I fell in love with Brent in Dangerous Waters. He spent the better part of his life in prison and just did not adapt well to the harsh realities of the real world and all the people that lived in it. He has isolated himself in his home and just wants to be left alone to do the one thing he loves, painting. His peaceful isolation is thrown into a tailspin when Anna Silver, the daughter of the only real friend he ever had shows up on his doorstep needing his help.Annas childhood was not only torn apart by her fathers conviction but also by a mother who became distant and didnt pay attention to her and also missed the signs that another tragic thing had happened to her. Due to this Anna has chosen to live her life with white picket fences and teaching children. She is in no way prepared for the mess that her father unfortunately put her in the middle of.As these two skittish people try and figure out who is trying to kill Anna and avoid them they find that they bring out the strong qualities of courage and tough uncompromising resolve in each other. The journey we take with these two not only on the harrowing investigation but also on two broken hearts healing is compelling.I knew from the moment I met Brent that his story would be a powerful one and the bonus is his heroine was just as strong and courageous as he was even though neither of them saw themselves that way. There were some great twist and surprises in this book that kept you turning the pages until the very end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11GMOEQOUFOUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTIHRK2#wasThisHelpful","R11GMOEQOUFOUO","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"She Can RunGreat suspense novel that has dual story lines that end up interconnecting. Beth and her two children have been on the run from her abusive husband, a Congressman who has a secret he wants to kill Beth for knowing, for ten months. Beth's Uncle, unknowingly to her, sets her up with a job with an old Nam buddy of his. But before Beth gets there he dies. His nephew (a cop who is on medical leave) has inherited the place and decides to keep Beth on for the job his Uncle had hired her for as he can tell there is something bad Beth and the kids are running from that has traumatized them.The other story line is Riverside Killer who abducts, rapes and murders women who all bear similar appearances. And the Killer now how his sites set on Beth.This was the first book I had read by this author and being a lover of romantic suspense I was very pleased at how well written this book was.Another great suspenseful novel full of multiple story lines that all converge together with a great supporting cast in a small northeastern Pennsylvania town.Rachel Parker has returned home 7 years after running away. She has come back to try and turn her grandfathers farm into a horse training and breading business after her career ended after being thrown from a horse. Not long after arriving bad things start happening on the ranch. An attempted break in and threatening messages painted on her barn. She just assumes they are from her brother in law who has turned into a mean abusive drunk. She is also suffering from guilt for just leaving town after her mothers funeral which in her eyes forced her sister to marry young to get away from their father. After getting a call from her sister to come and get her and her kids and rescue them from him she ends up having to fight for her life after finding her sister beaten and unconscious. She is rescued by the Police Chief Mike OConnell. They are both blindsided by their attraction but carry a lot of baggage that prevents either from acting on it at first.Mike still carries guilt for not catching a serial killer that had lived right under is nose. This guilt has has turned into an insane need to protect his town, and there are many weird things going on in town. When his growing feelings for Rachel turns into a conflict of interest and bring him under the radar of some corrupt city council members , one of which who wants to get him fired, he has to decide whats more important.There are multiple mysteries going on at the same time that all converge by the end of the book. The author does a great job of keeping your interest in all of these and wondering what is really going on. There was also a greater sense of camaraderie with the town in this one. Lots of great secondary characters and we get to see how Jack and Elizabeth from the first book are doing. I am looking forward to many more books from this author.She Can ScreamCharacter driven suspense with highly engaging characters and a killer to keep the tension high.The main characters Brooke Davenport and Luke Holloway are two souls haunted by past tragedies. Sixteen years ago Brookes roommate was murdered and it still haunts her today. Along with raising her two kids and teaching she feels she must make young women aware of the dangers that lurk around the corner and teaches a self-defense class. Lukes tragedy was more recent. Three months ago in the Philippines a terrorist bomb went off in the building he was in along with his assistant. Luke cannot get past seeing her die in front of him.The two are thrown together when Brookes brother who is Lukes best friend ask him to watch over her while he is deployed. When Brooke stops a killer from taking a young woman Lukes job changes from watching to protecting as Brooke cant let go of finding the perp and the killer decides he is going to mess with Brookes mind by leaving clues on bodies.Throughout the investigation we get to see some previous characters from the other books. Police Chief Mike OConnell and retired detective Jack OMalley are a big part of the team trying to catch the killer.Even though the killer/mystery is at the forefront there is also plenty of family time between Brooke and her kids and Luke and his grandmother and both of them having to finally come to terms with the significant things that has affected their lives and the decisions they have made based on those things.She Can HideA slow building mystery that has many characters that all end up coming together from different directions for the shocking conclusion.My thoughts on this one are that the author has written it so that the readers must deduce for themselves what the characters are like through their thoughts, actions, and interaction with other characters. When you got to the end of the book some of those conclusions you made throughout the book were not the right ones. Sometimes its refreshing to be wrong when reading a suspense or mystery trying to guess the who and what.This book was the perfect example that not all books have to be filled with tons of action to keep you turning the pages. Every character was interesting and you wanted to know more about each even though at first you didnt understand why all these characters were being introduced. But eventually the author reveals those reasons when the story lines intersect for what was a tense yet very satisfying conclusion.He Can FallWhat an adrenaline rush all packed into a short suspenseful story. All the characters were fascinating even the bad guys. It was also very noticeable that the author incorporated her real life training in Kenpo techniques into this book which for one made me never want to take her on in real life and and loving the creative way the hero took out the bad guys.Even though this was a fairly quick read it was jammed packed with action and suspense from the beginning and had a very satisfying ending. I bow to Ms Leigh and concede I loved it..","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1206NORB62WG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PMI4NDU#wasThisHelpful","R1206NORB62WG6","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Running On Empty (LCR Elite #1)Fabulous start to the series.. I still remember how I felt when I read Rescue Me  the first in the Last Chance series  and this was just as powerful. One of the biggest things I love is that Noah is running the new group. Cannot get enough of that man : )There were plenty of new and old characters in Running On Empty. We meet Sabrina Fox and Declan Steele after they are married. Declan works for another covert group that Sabrina used to work for and Sabrina now works for LCR Elite. They had tons of history and what looked like a very strong bond/love for one another that nothing could tear apart. Well fate had something else in store for the two when Declan is presumed dead after an explosion.I love the women that Ms Reece writes  they may not always come from a good background/childhood but they grow into strong kick-ass women. Sabrina stayed strong through it all even after her husband came back with wanting nothing but revenge against her for thinking she was a traitor and had him tortured for months. Poor Declan (I love his name BTW) mind was messed with so much during his torture/interrogations that even though he didnt break his mind did end up believing the lies they told him. It was painful to watch Sabrina and Delcan together when he first returned because you knew of the love they had before it was ripped from them.Even though these books are fiction, the emotions, partnerships and situations always feel so real. Its like an adventure reading one of Ms Reeces books. I am so happy she started this new series and look forward to many books to come in the series.Chance Encounter (LCR Elite #2)I loved that Ms Reece brought back a character from a previous book to give her story closure. Now of course she put her and her LCR protector through hell before that but that makes a great suspense.For those that dont know, Kendra Carson/Kacie Dane story began in No Chance (Last Chance Rescue #4). She was Skylars model friend who was kidnapped and drugged and raped repeatedly by Skylars sick and perverted uncle.Now five years later she has changed her name and appearance and is working her way up in the modeling industry again. She still suffers from nightmares but refuses to let what happened to her in the past define her. That is until she starts getting creepy messages from a man she knows to be dead.Brennan Sinclair is new to the LCR Elite team and his first assignment is to be Kacies bodyguard. Brennan past was a horribly sad and tragic and has left some pretty deep scars. Kacie and Brennan are like two sides of a coin  they both had traumatic past but Kacie still choose to see the good in people and life where as Brennan was very cynical and trusted very few. Neither had even thought about getting involved with anyone since their tragedies but their sorrow seems to bind them during their time together.As the book went along with the LCR team trying to find out who was harassing Kacie by sending her sick reminders of her time in captivity your page turning wondering who is going to be the person behind it and why. Ms Reece as always has a twisted mind and the revelations are shocking.Im so glad she is continuing this series and even bringing back past characters weve met. Its always a joy to get to see the past LCR characters and I look forward to many more books in this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R86KNACFMH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011M9DNKQ#wasThisHelpful","R1R86KNACFMH7","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Liam Beckett lives up to the proverb of like father like son. Which means the son will have traits similar to his father upon reaching adulthood and boy does he ever.The woman that Liam determines is his has emotionally shut down to prevent her heart from ever breaking again. There were times early in her grief of losing her husband that even her daughter couldnt bring her out into the light.Through the friendship of Cohen Cage who served with her husband and his wife Dani she has allowed herself to open up just enough to allow friends in but yet still keeping her deepest secrets to herself. She finds herself attracted to Liam but is so afraid of opening herself up again that she's been pushing him away for years.Liam finally decides he's had enough and smothers her and her daughter with kindness and love in hopes that she will eventually let her barriers she has erected over her heart down enough to trust him and allow herself to feel and be loved.There were many times I found myself misty eyed through out this book but I also felt it mirrored just a little to closely to Dee and Beckett's story so it lacked a little originality.Overall I enjoy all of these characters and getting to now read the next generation of a great group of men and women who I came to love in the Corp Security series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R114JP4P041QHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010GNOW86#wasThisHelpful","R114JP4P041QHO","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, I am so happy the authors early suspense books are getting cover makeovers and being re-released. Her suspenses arent always about a HEA, your lucky if you get a HFN (happy for now  case in point her Fear the Dark book) and this book also has a nontraditional ending.The plot of this book is LeAnne McVeigh whos a homicide detective arresting the husband of woman who was found strangled to death in their home. Up to the point of arresting him she was so sure he was guilty. But once she interviews Marcus 'Snake' Gallego little tiny seeds of doubts start especially after his request to see her once hes in prison telling her to please dont stop looking for the killer because it wasnt him.LeAnne gets lot of opposition on her thinking especially from her soon to be husband who happens to be the prosecutor and is looking to go for the death penalty.  Not long after Marcus is in prison two things happen. One a witness step forward giving him an alibi for the night his wife died, two another murder happens.Once Marcus is released he and LeAnne try to find out who the murder is but as they are investigation more murders keep happening. The reveal of who the murderer was wasnt a huge surprise but there is a big twist at the end thats shocking.  As I said in the beginning this book does not end in the traditional way. Its not concluded until Eyes Of Betrayal which is also being re-released soon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PP86TQTRCQLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010KNK7A4#wasThisHelpful","R3PP86TQTRCQLK","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Im sure my fascination to watch this came from all the viral hype of this movie. I love horror/scary movies and this premise of this sounded intriguing. I think maybe this would have been a better book so we could at least get the inner dialog of what the characters were thinking. On screen it was just too much of the characters sitting or lying around not speaking waiting for something to happen. There really wasnt a lot of dialog throughout this movie. If youre going to have it be more showing than telling you need to at least show something. Unfortunately I have to agree with other reviews  for what I paid to watch this it was nowhere near worth it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8176HL9SMDCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVXI6OM#wasThisHelpful","R8176HL9SMDCT","A3E8BQOX3OOUH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E8BQOX3OOUH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Do you have a new mommy on your gift list, or a mommy to be? Or is your diaper bag just in need of an upgrade?  My son is now 3, and I have had the same diaper bag since he was born, and let me tell you, it was time for an upgrade!!! What I love about this is that it does not necessarily look like a diaper bag, so now that he is 3, I can carry it like I do a tote bag, and only I know that it is actually a diaper bag!  This bag is big enough to fit everything I need in it for my day, wallet, keys, notepads etc and still has plenty of room for my son's essentials like diapers, wipes and snacks!  The quality is excellent, and I am proud to tote this around with me, knowing that nobody even knows it is a diaper bag!But if you do have a mommy on your gift list, this will be one of those practical gifts that she will be very thankful you got her.I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

With Thanksgiving around the corner, I am sure that these will look great on our dinner table, and I know that my family will love them as well.The color is beautiful, the plates look white with red rims, but when you turn them over they are completely red on the back.

"I love this uFashion3C Universal Clear Waterproof Case Bag Pouch. I have tried many of these, and I will have to say that this is the best one I have yet to get. I love the fact that it has an earphone jack, so you can listen to music on your phone and still keep it safe from the elements.  Another plus is that it has a clear screen for front fro the touchscreen  and back for your camera. Another plus is that it comes with an armband, something none of the others I have gotten have come with. So for the price, this really is your best bet for a waterproof case.I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

"This ZRAPO Copper Magnetic Bracelet is very beautiful, it looks wonderful on your wrist.  But does it really work? I was skeptical, but decided to give it a try and see what happened.  I love that it is made with 6 rare earth neodymium magnets imbedded in in it that send healing energy to painful joints, and seeing as I have really bad knees, I figured maybe it would help with the pain.So I wore it for a few days, maybe 4 or 5, and could not really tell a difference, so I took it off.  Well to my surprise, my knees were really hurting that day, so I decided to put the bracelet back on.  Well the next day, I had no pain in my knees, I really could not believe it.  I guess you don't realize how well it is working until you take it off.I also love how it is meant to increase & improve the flow of chi energy through your body. And you can't go wrong with a product that kooks great on men or women and is adjustable so it fits most wrists.All in all a very nice product, looks great and it works. It does tend to tarnish quite quickly, but if you just polish it, it looks like new.I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

"This Vitamin B3 serum is AMAZING!!!! I don't usually use a B3 serum, I always used a Vitamin C serum, and thought that was the best thing for my skin.  But I could not have been happier with the results after trying this serum.  I just put it on each night before bed, it does not take much, just about a pea size of the serum.  I love that it goes on very well, and it absorbs very quickly.  It does not leave my skin feeling greasy, it makes it feel extremely soft instead.I am noticing that the fine lines around my eyes and lips are fading slowly but surely.

"Being a very busy family, we usually forget to take out meat for dinner, and then end up waiting forever to cook dinner, or end up stopping to pick something up.  But not anymore, thanks to the Rapid Defrosting Tray by Neo Products USA.  The first time I used it, I left the meat in the ziploc bags we had them prepackaged in, and it cuts down the time it takes to thaw it out considerably. My husband touched the tray and couldn't believe how cold it was ( I had to tell him because it was pulling it out of the meat).  The next time I put the meat straight on the tray, and it did thaw even faster.

"I am a huge fan of Lulu Lube, the products that I have tried have all been top notch quality, and this is no exception.  The Lulu Sensual Massage Oil 16oz.comes in a very nice decorative bottle with a nice pumper, making it easy to use as well as easy on the eyes. What I love about it is the nice yet faint smell, it does not have the usual ""oil"" smell. It goes on very nicely and does not leave your skin feeling greasy or slick in anyway.  This is great to just give your partner a nice sensual massage after a long day at work. Of course, I like it much better when I am the one getting the massage :)I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

"I live in Florida, and it gets VERY HOT here during the summer, and my husband is always working outside.  So we are constantly looking for something to help keep him cool while he is out in the sun. We have tried numerous products, but none of them work for him. Until now that is!!! He absolutely loves this.  It is so easy to use, you wet it, ring it out, and put it on, and you stay cool.  If it stops cooling, you just rewet it to reactivate it!! So simple, and it really works!As a wife, I love that it is easily laundered and still does the job.  We have washed this several times, and it still works just as good as the first time we used it.

It also includes 4 color coded forks. This is a very nice set, and comes in a nice box with plenty of protection so that it will not be damaged when moving it from place to place.

It tells you what each brush is and how to use it!!! For a newbie like me that makes this set the BEST I have ever gotten. The brushes are very nice, great handles and the bristles are very soft. I like that they do not shed like others I have tried. Also the brochure tells you how to clean your brushes and make them last longer. The Set Contains:1. Precision Face Brush2. Flat Top Buffing Foundation Brush3. Blush Brush4. Face Powder Brush5. Powder Blush Brush6. Flat Top Shadow Brush7. Angle Flat Top Shadow Brush8. Eye Shadow Brush9. Blooming Brush10.

"I am not big on wearing wigs, just because I have so much hair, and never even thought to try them.  But I really like this EmaxDesigns Cosplay wig.  It is perfect for Halloween, which is just around the corner.  I would not wear this for an everyday wig, as the color is so vibrant it will be obvious it is a wig :) The best part is that it includes a cap to put over your hair, to help the wig fit better, and a very nice comb so that you can keep your wig looking new and tangle free.For someone who doesn't wear wigs, this was very easy to put on and adjust. The only issue I had was the bangs are right in your face and it takes a bit to get them adjusted so that you can see.

" 3:43 MinsWhat a great product this Seya Portable Collapsible Makeup Brush Portfolio Station with Mirror (Black) is.  If you are a makeup artist, this is a must have.  But for us everyday people, it is not a necessity, but it sure is something you will benefit from having. It is very compact so it is easy to stick in your bag when you are traveling.  I love the design, and how well it is made. It has two removable makeup brush holders and a removable mirror, so you can position them any way that fits your needs. It also adjusts with velcro so you can get just the right angle that you like when applying your makeup.

"I don't think I can remember the last time I did not have a great deal of stress in my life, as it has been this way for over 3 years now, I keep saying I am going to the doctor to get me something to destress myself, but then I got the chance to try this, and I figured I had nothing to lose but the dreaded stress. Now do not expect results immediately, it is recommended to take this for at least 4-6 weeks. Each day I feel like the stress is slowly lifting, the longer I take this, the less stress I feel on a daily basis.  Owning my own business I know that I will always have some stress, but this minimizes it greatly! I also seem to be sleeping more restful at night, probably due to less stress.

"Imagine being 15 and having a debilitating, undiagnosable fatal lung disease which severely limits your activities. Then suddenly, you find yourself whole and strong, and the heroine of the sky-world Magonia, with its sky-ships, bird people, squall-whales and canwrs  your own personal bird which lodges in your chest and enables you sing unimaginably beautiful music. The powerful music you sing with your canwr can even help you save Magonia from its enemies, and enable you and your world to survive.This is the situation of Aza Ray (named after the full spectrum of the alphabet, A to Z) once she is called to leave behind her dear friend Jason and claim her birthright.Aza is a witty, snarky teenager. Lovable quirky nerd Jason is devoted to her although both are unable to verbalize their feelings for each other. Aza learned from Jason: ""If you need a certain word to communicate, but that word happens to have years of baggage, and you want to get rid of the baggage it comes with, you cross it out, but use it anyway. Some people do it like this: "" (The text here reveals the word love with a strike-out line through it, which the Amazon site is unable to show).Aza and Jason have had an unusually close friendship since before Aza was five. According to the author, when Aza thinks of Jason, she knows ""I can read the gaps in your sentences. I can read the space between your letters....I know your language. It's my language too.""But when Aza's symptoms worsen, she develops pneumonia, and a feather is found in her lungs, Aza ascends to Magonia, a world that expert researcher Jason knows derives from medieval Celtic legends about people falling to earth from a sky-ship. He cannot bear to be parted from her. He must find a way, however dangerous, to find her and be with her again.During the first third of this original and well-written young adult novel, we are on earth. The characterizations of Aza and Jason, and their banter, are superbly presented. But Aza becomes a flatter character once in Magonia, and although highly imaginative, the characters there and their relationships are one-dimensional. Although original, the bulk of the book which occurs in Magonia is too unbelievable  artificial, hollow, and lacking characters you really get to know and care for.In Magonia, there are pirates, vultures, and a threatening enemy determined to destroy Aza and her companions. Earth's environmental catastrophes are also depleting Magonia's food supply, which is procured by invisible ladders to earth's crops. Most fascinating are the birds-in-the-chest, although the relationship between the birds and their hosts is not sufficiently explored  or any relationships on Magonia, for that matter. The author seems to have become enamored with world-building and left behind her talent for characterization and relationship building which made the first third of the book so emotionally engaging.At least we have brilliant, devoted Jason, who isn't willing to lose Aza Ray, and is even willing and able (unbelievably so) to cause an international incident in order to reunite with her.I rate the first third of the book a strong 5 stars. However, the majority of it, taking place in Magonia, barely rates a 3. However, I give it an overall 4 because of the superb beginning, its originality and the endearing relationship between Jason and Aza Ray.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37T9X4RERUCY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062320521#wasThisHelpful","R37T9X4RERUCY8","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why does a 12 year old, who doesn't even remember her name, wake up in what appears to be a coffin in a room filled with coffins? Are they indeed coffins, cradles or beds? Why is she now in an almost-adult body? Why are the other young persons she frees in a similar situation, but with different markings on their foreheads?Who are they all? Where are they? Who put them there? Why? Why are there so many corpses, bones and body parts in the many adjoining rooms? How can they stay alive in the adverse circumstances they encounter? How can they escape from their seemingly endless passage through macabre rooms?How can Em, as elected leader, deal with the power conflicts among members of her ""tribe"" and the ""tribe"" that they soon encounter? Finally, how can she bear the responsibility of decision-making, and the struggle between her own conscience and her newly discovered aggressive instincts?Reading ALIVE is opening yourself to the same questions that Em and the major characters ask about their circumstances. The novel arouses curiosity from the start and answers many but not all the questions it raises  although not, in my opinion, very convincingly.I found Em and Baker to be three-dimensional characters, although both possessing in-charge macho qualities and violent tendencies. The other characters are one or two-dimensional, and too many are introduced by the middle of the book.At first, although I am an adult and not a young adult, I enjoyed the novel and wanted to keep reading. But by the middle of the book, I was fed up with all the violence, death and gore. I was only interested in finishing the book out of curiosity and an interest in the psychological development of Em. However, her decisionmaking process was well beyond that of a 12 year old, even in a grown body.ALIVE did remind me of THE HUNGER GAMES and even moreso, LORD OF THE FLIES  the latter, because of the dark side expressed by some of the characters in their terrifying situation, and Em's encounter with the beast within. Aggression in life-and-death circumstances is certainly celebrated in the book, but fortunately is balanced to some extent with attention to resourcefulness, leadership skills and interpersonal negotiation.Overall, I became disappointed with the novel because the mysteries it raised were not convincingly answered, and because it was too filled with horror, violence and gore. For young adults, I'd rate it a high 3 or low 4. For me, it's a 3.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVWEXV2BKD1GA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553393103#wasThisHelpful","RVWEXV2BKD1GA","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How do you  review a book that is brimming with theories and generalizations about people that do not pertain to you? When the authors repeatedly makes assumptions which may accord with many people's experience but not your own, so that you are unable to agree with the primary thesis?This is my dilemma reviewing this THE WORM IN THE CORE, which addresses the fear the death.  In my nearly seven decades, I have had many confrontations with death  my own, family and friends. I have always felt connected to the spiritual world, and sometimes felt quite eager (without denying the joys of physical reality) to return the state between lifetimes.So the authors' thesis that people are so terrified of death that they erect innumerable barriers against dealing with it seems questionable to me, although I acknowledge that it is probably true for many people.  But it is not true for everyone.To be completely fair, the authors do (although only in a few sentences) say that religious people of deep faith (what about non-religious but deeply spiritual people?), self-confident people, those who have had close brushes with death, and the elderly may have come to terms with their mortality and be less afraid of death. But after briefly acknowledging these exceptions (which may be a substantial part of the population), the authors return to their central thesis. They are quick to draw conclusions from their research projects and experiments that associations and behaviors people have after being exposed to death-related imagery means that they have a deep-seated fear of death.The authors are terror-management specialists and clearly have considerable experience dealing with people suffering from terror-related disorders. But as a PTSD sufferer myself and a licensed psychotherapist, I am very aware of other terrors that may be at least, if not more, intense than the fear of death for some people. Consider:---the fear of psychological disintegration and insanity;---the fear of repeating an early unbearable trauma;---the fear of complete isolation or alienation;---the fear of being completely overpowered (psychologically or physically)---the fear of having one's life prolonged against one's wishes, one's living will ignored (which happened to my mother, who had previously had after-death experiences during surgery, and was eager to enter the afterlife), being forced to continue in a  helpless semi-vegetable state.Some of these fears are indeed fear of a kind of psychological death, a death of one's self, and end to personality integrity and cohesion.In all fairness, the authors of THE WORM INTHE CORE address the connection between fear of death and fear of losing self-esteem. They also discuss the urge for immortality, which can mean seeking to continue one's existence after death through one's children or creative work left behind (symbolic immortality). They clearly understand how the conscious or unconscious desire to escape from terror can be a central motivating force. Influenced by Ernest Becker's DENIAL OF DEATH, they expand upon his work, attempting to back up theory with scientifically valid research.I just question their interpretation of the results of many of their experiments, which seem to me to be reductionist - as if they had their premise from the start and were stretching their interpretations of the data in order to fit it.I also had the impression that they were dismissive of people to whom spiritual reality is at least as real as physical reality. ""So our ancestors...created a supernatural world, one in which death was not inevitable or irrevocable,"" they write, referring to early conceptions of heaven or the afterlife. Their vague references to people who believe in life beyond death (whether spiritual or physical) give the impression that they think ""believers"" are living in a world of make believe as an escape from our terror.I also question their generalities about the fear of death being related to a terror of one's personal and cultural world view being challenged. Not everyone's sense of self exists in their belief system  though living in the world of academia can lead one to be overly identified with one's thoughts.It also seems to me that a primary motivational force may be approach-oriented at least as much as avoidance-oriented --  movement TOWARD fulfillment in life, not running FROM death. Of course, confrontations with one's mortality (especially if one is over 60) can lead people to become more strongly invested in making the days they have left more meaningful. But many different factors (some pro-active and life-affirming rather than fear-oriented) can motivate the desire for meaning and significance.In short, I did not find THE WORM IN THE CORE to be worthwhile reading, in contrast to half a dozen books (including DIE WISE, which I recently read and reviewed) that I did find personally meaningful. But I acknowledge that THE WORM IN THE CORE may speak to many readers, especially readers in their 20s and those who are completely identified with their physical body and doubt spiritual reality. I therefore rate it three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K9YCM0VUWYVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400067472#wasThisHelpful","R1K9YCM0VUWYVI","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given the opportunity to review the Thule Urban Guide Sports stroller, and used it several times with my neighbor's grandchildren, whom she is unable to take out on her own. One is 1  years, and the other 4 years old. My impression is that this exceptional quality stroller is great for children ages 6 months to nearly 6 years, although children four years and older are likely to become adept at unstrapping themselves. Megan certainly was.When I last took it out on a trek to Trader Joes, I only had one child with me, and used the other seat for two hefty bags of groceries, which worked fine and counter-balanced the child's weight. The terrain between my apartment complex and TJ's is rough and varied  concrete, grass, muddy trail, a steep hill and a few stairs, and the stroller performed exceptionally well on all terrains,  though the stairs were of course bumpy. Because the front wheel swivels to any angle, I could easily turn the stroller, even in the tight 90 degree angled doors entering TJ's.With two children, there is still a storage area in the stroller for a purse, jacket, bag of groceries etc.Because of my own physical limitations in regard to lifting, I hesitated to open and close the stroller to take it in and out of a car, but when I did so recently I found that it was easy to fold up and lift in and out of the car seat then I had anticipated  easier than lifting a squirming four year old who doesn't want to cooperate.I also like that the reclining seats are helpful in encouraging a child to nap, that there is an adequate sun shade (though the summer sun isn't yet a problem here in New England), that the wheels can locked (you would lock the front wheel when jogging anyway), and that you can control the height of the handlebar. I did try jogging with it, and found it easy to do so  the stroller just seems to glide along and the handle even provides some support. The zippered storage area is also particularly useful.I can only compare this stroller to the one I had and used many years ago  which was bare bones, and weak in every way that the Thule Urban Glide stroller excels. I can't imagine that any stroller could be better than this one unless it is equipped with some kind of self-soothing spray oriented to keeping kids on their best behavior.My only gripe in regard to using it  - the strap for locking it closed is not very durable and almost fell off during my third stroller trek.Although I was initially inclined to downgrade my rating for this stroller because of the high cost, I am rating it 5 stars because of its exceptional quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PPOPE62XIDEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U4HDLGO#wasThisHelpful","R1PPOPE62XIDEL","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have thick straight hair halfway to my waist, which has never held wave or curl for more than a few hours. Although the InStyler excels in straightening hair and increasing  volume, I was more interested in creating waves and loose curls (as well as flip-under and flip-up effects) which would hold for several days.Amazingly enough, the InStyler was quite successful in doing so, although the learning curve was greater than I wished, and I still hesitate to use it even after several weeks, for fear of burning my fingers. Of the four settings, the hottest temperature setting  - best for long thick hair  is 425 degrees.When I first received the Instyler, I was intimidated by its size, the various pieces included in the kit, and the instructions, and did not use it immediately. However after viewing half a dozen of the videos about using it at myinstyler.com I gained enough confidence to try. There are about 20 2-3 minutes videos there on such topics as Fine or Short Hair, Flip In, Making Soft Curls, Installing the Thermal Guard etc. At Youtube, there are even more videos demonstrating various  curling, straightening and volume enhancing techniques geared specifically to short, long, fine or thick hair. I highly suggest watching those relevant to you before using InStyler, so that you do not burn yourself or are unhappy with the results.The optional thermal guard attachment which helps you avoid burning your fingers can also catch and tangle your hair, so you may choose not to use it. I snapped it on initially but removed it after several weeks.Because the videos and included instruction manual clearly explain and/or demonstrate a variety of InStyler techniques, and many Amazon reviews also provide how-to tips for different hairstyles, I will not do so here. Instead I will indicate what I like (a lot) and don't like about InStyler, and provide a few hints I've learned about using it.FEATURES: POSITIVE--takes only 30-40 seconds to heat up, and provides 3 heat settings--consists of an automatic rotating barrel and several brushes which keep the hair soft and smooth as they straighten, increase volume or curl--includes an excellent large comb, heat-resistant pad, and readable instruction manual--the 1  inch barrel is just the right size for loose curls--has a thermal attachment to help you avoid burning your fingers--has an automatic shut-offADVANTAGES--keeps hair soft and smooth--does not tangle your hair (except occasionally when you use the thermal protection)--has superb results creating waves with long thick hair--most people can completely style their hair in about 15 minutes--your styling result holds for several days--can be used to straighten or curl hair, and to increase volumeCRITICISMS-- No storage bag is provided.--The drill sound the Instyler makes when in use is too loud - unlikely to please a sleeping partner or nearby roommate.--Anyone who had a rotator cuff or upper arm injury might find (as I did) that raising their arm to hold the large InStyler up for 10 seconds at a time on a dozen or more sections of hair at the back of the head can be difficult and painful. Since I have had rotator cuff injuries and cramps in both upper arms, I find that styling long back hair is difficult and painful, especially near the back of the head.SUGGESTIONS FOR USE-- First, watch the videos that are relevant to you-- Start with dry or only slightly damp clean untangled hair that you have just brushed-- Pin up clumps of your hair so you can work on your hair in sections-- Give yourself at least half an hour the first few times you use it-- Although the highest setting for long thick hair is the hottest, use the medium setting and take additional time if you are uncomfortable with the intensity of heat-- Be very careful not to burn your fingers-- Go very slow, spending at least 7-10 seconds on each section, and hesitating for a second more at the end of your hair-- Gently your hold each hair section up for a second or two after styling it to allow it to set-- If creating beachy waves or loose curls, alternate the direction to which you rotate the brush or twist your hair so that your curls fall both out and under, both left and right-- Don't brush or comb hard when done, but rather use your fingers to fluff up your hair and separate any clumps-- Enjoy the new you!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BOMIUMVJVBWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5N5KZO#wasThisHelpful","R1BOMIUMVJVBWK","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved THE EUREKA FACTOR! Of course, being 100% intuitive on the Myers-Briggs test and a writer and once-upon-a-time photographer and psychotherapist, I was bound to relate to the authors' descriptions of personalities and circumstances conducive to insight, intuition and creativity. Indeed, THE EUREKA FACTOR is likely to be especially meaningful, confirming and illuminating to readers who possess the kinds of minds that psychology professors Kounios and Beeman describe.But it is also likely to be informative and enlightening to anyone who wishes to understand the factors  innate and engineered  which contribute to creativity and insight, especially the AHA experience in which insight unexpectedly bursts into consciousness.The authors are skilled at backing up their assertions with considerable research, which wisely they place in lengthy notes at the end of the book rather than clutter the pages with scholarly footnotes. Unlike most academics, they also write in a clear, highly readable, almost conversational manner, without dumbing down their explanations or inflating their message with unnecessary repetitions and lengthy anecdotes. The examples and anecdotes they do provide are succinct and relevant.Yes, many readers are likely to already know some of the of the points they make. For example, immersion in a problem with substantial preparation followed by a relaxing diversion or sleep contributes to creative insight. But Kounios and Beeman do not just inform us of the findings of neuroscience. They are also practical, and oriented toward helping readers enhance their own insight and creativity. In the latter part of the book, the authors provide more than a dozen suggestions for increasing the frequency and significance of one's ""AHA"" experiences.Examples of some of the discoveries about ""the eureka factor"" which they discuss include:1) People experience an increase in alpha waves before an insight emerges into consciousness, and then a huge burst of gamma rays in the right temporal lobe (the anterior superior temporal gyrus) when it unexpectedly emerges.2) The right hemisphere of the brain far more than the left enables us to make remote associations, drawing from a wide network of neural connections, which remain active beneath the surface of consciousness before the ""eureka"" moment.3) A narrow analytical focus can crush an emerging insight and prevent it from becoming conscious.4) Analytical personalities tend to ""errors of commission"" whereas insightful personalities tend to ""errors of commission"".Suggestions for maximizing our capacity to have breakthrough insights include:1) Attention to the far-off, long-range and general rather than the near, short range, and specific.2) Exposing oneself to new, unusual perspectives and environments.3) Engaging in activities which contribute to a positive and especially a playful mood.4) Choosing to be in an environment which is spacious and open, such as a large uncluttered room with a high ceiling or nature (the colors blue and green are particularly advantageous).Many years ago, when applying to graduate school, I took the Miller Analogies Test and scored quite well. But being particularly fond of making remote associations, I wanted to retake the test and improve my score. I bought a study guide for the MAT, at the same time  started reading a new science fiction series which completely entranced me. Inevitably, instead of  studying the MAT book, I read 15 science fiction novels in the one month before retaking the test. The result? My score improved so dramatically , that it was now at the very top of the scale.  That experience made a lasting impression upon me, and is now confirmed by Kounios and Beeman's emphasis upon opening the mind new contexts and alternate realities.My only criticisms of THE EUREKA FACTOR are very minor ones. Although they briefly address the issue of pseudo-insight or false intuition by suggesting that we ask why we are having a particular insight, the authors don't elucidate the emotional factors that can contribute to such self-deception. They refer to ""prevention"" and ""promotion"", but do not discuss how the role of fear and desire can interfere with the validity and significance of one's insight.  They also do not elucidate the different qualities of consciousness that can accompany different kinds of insight  states of mind of which those of us who meditate or pay considerable attention to the subtleties of our inner process may be aware. But I have yet to encounter any writers who adequately address either of the above topics, so I cannot fault the authors for failing to do so.In short, I highly recommend THE EUREKA FACTOR to everyone who wishes to understand the physiological and psychological factors contributing to creative insight and/or wishes to increase their own ability to have ""AHA"" experiences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R286FEX3E9P75E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400068541#wasThisHelpful","R286FEX3E9P75E","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""My father tried to teach me I have a place. Trying to be out of that place is like the stars fighting to move outside their path. I am on that path, now, and I must stay there.....I gave an oath to my father. I cannot dishonor his memory.""These are the words of Adira, daughter of the caravan. In order to accompany and help her merchant father, Adira has been dressed and raised as a boy. When her father is killed, she is unwilling to be daughter to her uncle and aunt, Abram and Sarai, or to live the restricted life of desert females.Adira heads off alone into the desert, in pursuit of her father's killers and Raph, a mysterious Northman with whom she has fallen in love. She believes Raph and his brother Mika (perhaps variants of Raphael and Michael) to be angels who are seeking out Abram, on some secret mission of their own. Mika even appears to have magical powers.Many years ago, I read Anita Diamant's THE RED GATE,  Biblical fiction with a pagan slant, which soon afterwards became a popular historical read. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed ANGELS AT THE GATE even more than Diamant's excellent novel. ANGELS AT THE GATE is well-researched but not heavy with historical details, and has only a touch of early Hebrew religion as well as paganism. Best of all, it features a courageous yet vulnerable young heroine whom readers cannot help but like.Devoted to her loyal dog Nami and the memory of her father, Adira is determined to be true to herself.  Except for when she chose to take off on her own into the desert without adequate water, I found her to be completely believable. Author T.K. Thorne succeeds in portraying Adira from the inside out, so that we experience her feelings and thoughts, and yet also stand outside of her, caring for her and feeling protective of her as she struggled to survive in a threatening environment.In ANGELS AT THE GATE, the Biblical story of Abram and Sarai remains peripheral. Yes, Adira eventually is compelled to marry Lot, and is confined to life in hostile, degenerate Sodom. Yes, Sodom, is on the verge of destruction. But Thorne skirts around the brief Biblical narrative without altering it, providing her own unique perspective on characters that the book of Genesis does not reveal in any detail.The story that Thorne tells is so engaging that the words are almost invisible, painting scenes that leap off the page and lead us to want to know more.  One lesson that Adira learned from her father was the importance of asking the right questions. As we read about her, we are likely to ask a number of questions ourselves: What is the dreaming stone that Mika and Raph protect? Who really is Mika? Will Lot's unappreciated preaching of the god El bring danger to his family?  What happens to Nami?Most of our questions are likely to be answered . Others remain a mystery, but not knowing the answers does not detract from the fulfilling conclusion to the novel. ANGELS AT THE GATE is a book to be savored. I rate it five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT23FBLMEJ86P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=390619602X#wasThisHelpful","RT23FBLMEJ86P","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I have an abiding interest in ancient Greek myth and literature (which I teach) and have travelled extensively in Greece, I have been ignorant about Greece's contemporary issues, and was eager to read this book. For the most part, it did not disappoint, although the reality it portrays is sobering.THE FULL CATASTROPHE clearly explains the dilemmas of Greece's financial irresponsibility and indebtedness, economic and social welfare troubles, and ongoing multiculturalism vs. anti-foreigner conflict, particularly in reference to the activities of the xenophobic, far right Golden Dawn political party.  This illuminating book reveals how these situations developed since World War II, and especially during the past decade.I did however feel that author/journalist James Angelos spent too much time interviewing a handful of people regarding the immigration conflict, and focusing on the troubles in Agios Panteleimonas Square in Athens. What about the situation in the rest of Athens, and above all, most of Greece? After quite successfully describing the dilemmas Greece faces today and the causes, the book focuses for far too long on one piece of the puzzle and becomes partial and imbalanced in its perspective.Some insights gained reading this book:1) Joining the EU boosted Greece's economy but the large amounts of money borrowed from other European countries was not spent on strengthening Greece's economy, but rather disappeared as a result of increased handouts and corruption. Meanwhile, Greek politicians were slow in abiding by their agreement in regard to ""cleaning up"" the system and cutting back on social welfare.2) The Greek government apparently ""cooked the books"" in order to get Greece into the EU.3) Greek society seems to depend to a frightening extent upon graft, bribery, political patronage, and various forms of trading favors.4) Many Greeks receive benefits they do not deserve (e.g. seeing-persons receiving benefits for the blind) , with the help of officials who take kickbacks for overlooking offenses.5) Unemployment is between 25-30%, therefore contributing to dependence upon social welfare and understandable protests against austerity measures.6) The Greek system which forbids firing of public employees for incompetence and guarantees jobs for life has contributed to the laziness and inefficiency of many government workers.7) Many Greeks seem to be taking refuge in the ""glory of the past"" rather than committing themselves responsibly and wholeheartedly to coping effectively with present circumstances.8) German/Greek tensions are high due to Germany lending considerable money to Greece, and Greeks, still haunted by memories of the German occupation in World War II, feeling they are entitled to war reparations they never received.9) Greece, as a gateway to Europe Proper is an unintended waystation for hundreds of thousands of poor, suffering immigrants from Africa and the Mideast who are unable to reach their intended destinations, and severely overburden an already strained economy and social welfare system.10) A far-right strident and sometimes violent anti-immigration political party called The Golden Dawn has inflamed many Greeks against foreigners, distorting reality in the process. Police support of the Golden Dawn often has led to failure to protect foreigners, who are victims of harassment and violence.Greece truly is the young, not-very-welcome child of the European Union, who unlike Joseph who was thrown into a pit by his brothers, appears to have dug its own pit and want rescue without being willing or able (often for good reason) to climb out of the pit itself.As Angelos points out, the attitude of some Greeks is ""We gave light to the world and held onto the darkness."" And yet Angelos tells us that ""Greeks also often see themselves on account of their ancient legacy, as a kind of chosen people, superior to others....Greeks consequently often feel that Europeans should be grateful for being shown the way out of the cave and into the light.""What is the solution? Angelos doesn't dare to speculate. The problems are deep-seated and extensive, with Greece on the verge of losing its membership in the EU and undergoing an even great socio-economic meltdown. Hopefully, Greece's new liberal government will find a way  slowly and arduously  out of the pit, but it is dark and deep. Meanwhile, author James Angelos sheds some light for us in this engaging and illuminating presentation of the problems of Greece today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13IATO7D0G9Z9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385346484#wasThisHelpful","R13IATO7D0G9Z9","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In these times of self-glorification, celebrity-worship, competitive pressure to succeed, and rampant consumerism, what has happened to personal morality and commitment to such enduring values as integrity, self-discipline, honest self-examination, humility and service? Whether or not you are religious, whether you are Democrat or Republican, you can still choose to increase your worth at least as much as your wealth by dedicating yourself to building your character.New York Times columnist David Brooks admits in THE ROAD TO CHARACTER that he has been a ""narcissistic blowhard"" ambitiously pursuing external values, and that only recently has he undergone the self-searching that led him to research and write this book . ""I wrote it to save my soul,"" he says.Clearly, he is addressing the soul of our society as well, as he points out that the words character, conscience, gratitude and kindness are used far less frequently than they were in the mid-20th century, and that human research reveals a huge drop in empathy since the year 2000.Borrowing from Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, Brooks distinguishes between two kinds of personalities  Adam I (aggressive pursuer of worldly success) and Adam II (persons committed to the inner life, and values such as kindness, integrity and dedication to a larger purpose). He also differentiates ""resume virtues"" of external achievement from ""eulogy virtues"" of inspiring character. This book is about notable Adam IIs and their ""eulogy virtues.""Basically, THE ROAD TO CHARACTER consists of profiles of 11 admirable persons whom Brooks admires for their virtues, in spite of their personal flaws. Although similarities exist in regard to most of these individuals  an emphasis upon self-examination, integrity, self-effacement, kindness, commitment to facing and learning from adversity, service  they also differ in some significant ways.These are the major chapters in the book and personalities discussed:The Summoned Self- Frances PerkinsSelf-Conquest  Dwight EisenhowerStruggle  Dorothy DaySelf-Mastery  George MarshallDignity  A. Philip Randolph and Bayard RustinLove  George EliotOrdered Life  St. AugustineSelf-Examination  Samuel Johnson and Michel MontaigneThe Big Me  Johnny Unitas (in contrast to Joe Namath)Having a lifelong interest in ethics and the inner life, and possessing a philosophy of life deeply influenced by Viktor Frankl, I have felt out of place in contemporary society and hungry for the kind of ethical nourishment and personal examples that Brooks' provides. Two of the persons he profiled have previously been meaningful to me  Montaigne and Eliot  and indeed Brooks' chapter on Eliot was my favorite, apart from his inspiring conclusion.George Eliot not only wrote exceptional novels, she also translated Feuerbach's ESSENCE OF CHRISTIANITY. But as Brooks pointed out, Eliot believed that religious faith is not necessary for one to dedicate oneself to character development and kindness, and that living an ethical, compassionate life can be helped by having a deep personal relationship based on both spiritual and physical love. Defying convention, Eliot experienced such a love with George Lewes, a married writer separated from his wife. Brooks eloquently describes her personal transformation and resulting beliefs, such as ""All love is narrowing. It is the renunciation of the other possibilities for the sake of the one choice.""In addition to Eliot, I was also moved by several others of Brooks' profiles, notably Johnson, Eisenhower and Day. Johnson, for example, felt that we all have a duty to train our will, and to help make the world a better place. He also believed that good literature could aid us in our moral improvement.  Eisenhower was suspicious of hubris and the misuse of power, sought to subordinate himself for the good of the whole, and cultivated a persona which demonstrated as much as possible the traits he wished to manifest.Despite the inspirational examples of many of these profiles and an exceptional concluding chapter, THE ROAD TO CHARACTER is, at least in my opinion, somewhat flawed. Bayard Rustin, who led a wild, promiscuous life certainly did not belong in the book. And too many of the persons Brooks discussed lived stoic, self-denying lives.  I found myself questioning whether living ethically and cultivating such virtues as kindness necessarily have to mean considerable repression of instinct, desire and emotion.My impression that Brooks mostly chose examples who possessed qualities that were the opposite of those he sought to overcome. There's nothing wrong with that  but a virtuous life may not require extreme self-denial if one doesn't have too large a self initially. These persons may not all be ideal role models for those of us who are seeking inner balance and adaptability to today's world.Consider  the many women in particular who still place undue emphasis upon others or may subordinate themselves not due to their ideals but rather due to lack of self-esteem. Perhaps a viable character ideal for them, and for many people today, does not involve self-judgment and self-repression but rather developing a healthy sense of self and healthy balance between meeting the needs of self and responsiveness to others.We all have multiple selves within us, manifesting at different times and in different ways. We can live virtuous lives, and deeply care for others, while being self-confronting, dedicated to self-improvement, self-accepting, self-effacing and self-confident. We can also pursue success in the world while maintaining an internal sense of gravity, being true to one's own conscience and values. We can construct for ourselves the life of an Adam III --- or an EVE III.In Brooks' eloquent final chapter, he presents his humility code which includes fifteen admirable qualities of character. Live not for happiness, but for holiness, he tells us. Cultivate a long-term rather than short-term perspective. Learn to quiet yourself and your ego. Maintain humility and respect for the wisdom of the past. Seek to find and commit yourself to your true vocation, and strive for excellence in your work. Seek maturity above success.""People do get better at living, at least if they are willing to humble themselves and learn,"" Brooks tells us. ""Over time they stumbles less, and eventually achieve moments of catharsis when outer ambition comes into balance with inner aspiration, when there is a unity of effort between Adam I and Adam II, when there is that ultimate tranquility and that feeling of flow  when moral nature and external skills are united in one defining effort.""Despite its flaws  its unevenness, omissions, and occasionally simplistic and one-sided generalization, THE ROAD TO CHARACTER is an important and substantial book. The values that Brooks discusses are indeed being neglected in our society, to our detriment and the detriment of future generations. Indeed, many of these values have the potential to unite Republicans and Democrats who polarize over specific causes rather than seek agreement and cooperation in regard to the values and ideals they hold in common. For these reasons, and the fact that Brooks write in clear, accessible language, I rate the book five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R148GQVVXZEWB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081299325X#wasThisHelpful","R148GQVVXZEWB4","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Hamilton Beach Food Processor is my first food processor so I can only share my experience and opinions without comparing it to other food processors. Basically, I am pleased, and am amazed at what this relatively inexpensive appliance can do.Not quite sure how it worked and anxious about trying new (potentially dangerous) appliances, I was glad that it came with a detailed instruction manual (14pp. in English) with safety tips, diagrams, instructions for use (of chopping blade, slicing disc and shredding disc), processing charts indicating the kinds of foods suitable for each of these three fixtures and the maximum amount of ingredients to use with each one. Also included in the instruction manual  hints for care and cleaning, a troubleshooting guide, and several recipes.I also appreciate a number of hints included for maximum effectiveness such as freezing soft cheese for 30 minutes before food processing and adding ingredients in similar size chunks, if possible. Users are advised NOT to use the food processor for slicing frozen meats or crushing ice.Important safety precautions include: Unplug the appliance when not in use, and never feed food into the chute by hand (use the food pushers).Fortunately, it is  easy to assemble this food processor  just situate the bowl on it and snap in place,  insert the blade or disc you are going to use and the black plastic pusher piece necessary for it to operate, add ingredients into the food pusher, snap on the secure lid, and press the right button for the job  slide/shred, puree/mix or pulse.Although the food processor supposedly holds 12 cups of ingredients, I was not comfortable adding more than 10 cups  nor did I need to do so. In many  cases, you are supposed to leave  of the space open at the top (beneath the lid, of course) anyway.In my first month of having it, I have used it mostly for cutting many fruits and vegetables, preparing soup, shredding carrots and pureeing tomatoes. It definitely is not good with very soft sticky foods (bananas, muenster cheese) but otherwise has not presented any difficulty. The motor is powerful and the blade is very sharp (frighteningly so!).Other features I like about it:a) it doesn't work unless the black plastic piece is inserted and the parts are snapped together properlyb) you don't need to do much precuttingc) it has a spout for pouringd) the blade and lid securely stay in placee) it's easy to clean.My only issue with it is related to my having a kitchenette in a small apartment, with limited counter space. The height of the food processor is  inch too high for the space under my kitchen cabinet, so it takes up the only open counter space I have when in use. Also, as a single person household, it is larger than I need - I would have preferred it to be a bit smaller. But this isn't likely to be an issue for most users, who will probably be pleased at the efficiency and capabilities of this economical food processor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VUW0C1SK05B3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHLN7K2#wasThisHelpful","R3VUW0C1SK05B3","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered EXPLORE THE COSMOS to read and review because I am fascinated by astronomy,  love the book FAR OUT with its amazing full color images of outer space, and was drawn to the publicity about EXPLORE THE COSMOS's ""striking images from the Hubble Telescope.""Therefore, upon receiving it, I was deeply disappointed to note that it not only has no color pictures whatsoever, but that the few dozen black and white pictures it contains are notably poor quality  underexposed, and with very little detail and minimal gradation of light to dark (I teach Photoshop, and even tell students who Hubble telescope images are translated into color and b&w pixels, so I'm not at all ignorant on this subject).If review copies of this book  lack color photographs that the final editions contain, then at least the publisher could have indicated to reviewers that their editions would lack ""striking images"". But since there was no indication, I can only assume that this book contains only low quality underexposed images.EXPLORE THE COSMOS is listed as intended for ages 8-12. I am considerably older than that, but have taught 12-years olds, and chose to read a children's book because I thought it would help me clarify and organize the smatterings of astronomical knowledge that I have into a coherent whole. In fact, it did. In this way, the book is a relatively thorough basic introduction to astronomy.Of the 162 pages in this book, 27pp. are about the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson  the first two chapters and a later chapter. These introduce him not only as an astrophysicist but also as a well-rounded human being who has pursued other interests as well  even wrestling and ballroom dancing. Only 1/6 of the book is about Tyson; the rest is an introduction to astronomy.The astronomy chapters cover:1) the history of astronomy and the nature of life;2) the origin of the universe and galaxies, nebulae, dark matter etc.;3) the Milky Way and our solar system (general);4) the inner planets;5) the icy giants beginning with Jupiter and the outer reaches of the solar system;6) future prospects in astronomical investigation.Apart from an absence of quality color photos, my primary issue with EXPLORE THE COSMOS concerns the unevenness of the text and language, given its 8-12 audience. For example, on the one hand, the book defines light years and the Big Bang, but doesn't clearly explain why we can view light events that occurred relatively soon after the universe was born.This is one of several cases in which the book assumes middle school plus reading ability and understanding. Yet at the same time, it is full of short simple sentences, which seem to be addressing second  grade readers  e.g. ""Scientists expect that our Sun will burn for another five billion years. That is a very long time.""I also found myself wondering why author Saucier would briefly refer to dark matter and yet make no references whatsoever to CERN and recent developments pertaining to the discovery of the Higgs-Boston, and ongoing experiments in that regard, as televised on NOVA and many science shows. Wouldn't a young reader want to relate his new knowledge  of astronomy to the current events in astronomy he or she might be watching on tv?But I did find that EXPLORE THE COSMOS  successfully summarized key astronomical developments and clearly defined its  terminology (with a glossary containing about a hundred entries  e.g. dwarf planet, red shift, Oort Clouds, planetary nebula). It also provided interesting tidbits of information that I had not previously known.Some examples: Before the mid20th century, Hubble Telescope scientists believed that the Milky Way was the only galaxy. The process of a black hole squeezing an object as it sucked  it into its singularity is called ""spaghettification."" There have been no humans walking on the Moon since 1972. Uranus's moons are named for Shakespearean characters. In the next few years, we will be receiving new astronomical data from missions probing Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.One anecdote shared by Saucier was particularly interesting to me, and likely to be meaningful to other female readers in particular. In 1961, a 14 year old girl wrote NASA asking how she might become an astronaut. NASA told her that girls can't be astronauts. (Why? They didn't say.) In 1967, NASA accepted its first black astronaut, and in 1978, its first female astronaut. Who was the girl who wrote the 1961 letter to NASA?  Hillary Rodham Clinton.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26SKYIX8F5O3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880141#wasThisHelpful","R26SKYIX8F5O3","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan of Bosch wiper blades, and this one is no exception. I only got one  a 20 incher for my old toyota, since I replaced the other blade with Bosch about six months ago and it's still working fine. Although the two aren't identical, visually they look similar and both do the job well. This particular ""Insight"" blade definitely suggests quality.What counts most for me is that this blade quickly clears the windshield, which with the freezing rain we often get here in New England is an absolute necessity. And it doesn't leave messy streaks either which impair vision. Also, it doesn't squeak when the windshield is barely wet but still needs some clearing - some cheaper wiper blades squeak, which is particularly annoying.Because we've had very little snow so far this winter, and I haven't driven yet while it's snowing, I haven't had the opportunity to try them out in conditions of heavy snow, but the blade quickly clears the window of accumulated snow. The close friction with the windshield appears to generate heat too which helps with the melting of ice.Not being handy, I had my helpful auto serviceperson install the blade, as I always do. It takes him less than two minutes. . If you've never installed a wiper blade before, ask your service station worker or mechanic  most would do this for free and quickly too  if you're also giving them paid business.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NKTZGXB7CLBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWNZ51C#wasThisHelpful","R1NKTZGXB7CLBG","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE EVIL HOURS is both a personal exploration of author, war correspondent and PTSD sufferer David Morris' own PTSD experience incurred in Saydia, Iraq, AND an informed discussion of the history of the history of PTSD and various successful and unsuccessful treatment methods. The chapters are titled Saydia, In Terror's Shadow, Toward a Genealogy of Trauma, Therapy, Drugs, Alternatives, and Growth. Also included are an epilogue, extensive, well-research notes, and a select bibliography.PTSD is now the most common psychiatric disorder diagnosed in the U.S.  ""Trauma destroys the fabric of time,"" Morris  tells us, describing  how the brain keeps reliving unintegrated traumas which appear to have seared themselves in our brain cells.  ""The more helpless the patient felt, the more likely he was to be traumatized... PTSD survivors are not alive, not dead, but somehow both and neither.""PTSD survivors often live a state of emotional numbing and hypervigilance, interrupted by flashbacks and eruptions of repressed feelings. They may also increasingly isolate themselves in order to protect themselves from exposure to words or events that will potentially trigger the original trauma, ""living inside a PTSD bubble, a severely limited range of activities that doesn't trigger their symptoms"".Morris explains that PTSD was not a recognized psychiatric diagnosis until 1980, a result largely of the battle by Vietnam Veterans Against the War to get the disorder officially recognized.In tracing the known history of PTSD, Morris tells us that an ancient Sumerian text, THE LAMENTATION OF UR (ironically, Ur = Uruk = Iraq) referred to traumatic reactions to war, and that the ILIAD and ODYSSEY have been significant texts in regard to the literary portrayal of PTSD. Having been moved and influenced by Jonathan Shays' ACHILLES IN VIETNAM, I highly recommend Shay's book and related writings, especially since Achilles so thoroughly demonstrates the sudden eruptions of PTSD rage - and the road back to integration within the community.Morris discusses the traumas experienced by Civil War Veterans, many considered to be cowards, and how they were sometimes regarded as having a mental disease, their symptoms being referred to as nostalgia or heart-ache (in the Greek, nostos=home and algia =pain). A more extensive but still incomplete recognition of the adult-onset disorder occurred during World War I, when thousands of soldiers and veterans were diagnosed with what then was called ""shellshock"".Although Morris refers to other kinds of PTSD (such as rape trauma) besides combat trauma, his focus is on the PTSD experienced by veterans, particularly veterans of Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. As a PTSD survivor myself, whose own PTSD was a result of hundreds of small but deeply impactful traumatic incidents in childhood, I wish that Morris had explored in some depth the experience and treatment of non-combat and long-term chronic PTSD.Nevertheless, much of what he wrote was meaningful to me - especially the sharing of personal experiences of PTSD survivors and the effects of various kinds of treatment.What might enable the PTSD victim to cope more effectively with his PTSD symptoms? In quoting a VA researcher, Morris tells us that ""the major PT factor is whether the traumatized person received social support."" ""Accept that there are things in this world that can break us,"" Morris advises readers suffering from PTSD. ""Only then can we begin to make meaning out of everything that came after.""The resilience of PTSD survivors is helped by ""having a solid moral compass, spiritual faith, having a role model, social support, confronting one's fears, and seeing oneself as having a mission in life. The key predictor of who would bounce back....was a sense of optimism.""One focus of Morris' book is the process by which Vietnam Veterans against the War with such leaders as Robert Jay Lifton actively fought to recognition of PTSD in opposition to the Nixon White House and often the VA itself, which wished to minimize the negative consequences of war.In his very informative chapters on treatment options, Morris warns us that the focus on pharmaceutical means of treatment and mass-produced treatment programs neglect the important interpersonal dimension of the healing process involved, short-circuiting and ignoring completely the therapist-client relationship. It can also can lead to avoidance in regard to confronting moral issues such as torture that contribute to the onset of PTSD.""The problem, really, is that while humanity continues to experience huge leaps in technology, we experience no equivalent leaps in our ethical capacity. On the never-ending arms race between technology and ethics, technology always wins.""Morris discusses pharmaceutical treatments (e.g. propranolol, zoloft), psychodynamic therapy (especially  helpful for long-term chronic PTSD), flooding and prolonged exposure (PE). The latter he points out is not effective for some PTSD sufferers because it may retraumatize them.I found myself particularly intrigued by the two last chapters in which Morris explores alternative treatment methods and the possibility of resulting personal growth. Rather than address the trauma, yoga, meditation and other mind-body techniques are particularly helpful to the reintegration process.Some veterans have also indicated that their PTSD experience has actually had positive as well as negative consequences - that they were able to allow the crisis of PTSD to enable them to change their lives for the better, and in many cases, awaken their compassion and spirituality. This focus, ignored by most treatment plans and by the VA, is certainly one that can enhance the coping ability of PTSD survivors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22S0X3WE54C19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544086619#wasThisHelpful","R22S0X3WE54C19","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tracy K. Smith won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 2012, at the age of 40, for her book of poems, LIFE ON MARS. I had not read her poetry when I chose to read and review her new memoir, ORDINARY LIGHT. But enamored with her illuminating prose, which reveals her skills as both poet and storyteller, I am now reading LIFE ON MARS  but  much prefer her marvelous, touching, tenderly self-revealing, distinctively unordinary ORDINARY LIGHT.Tracy grew up in a predominantly white northern California suburb, in a large loving black family which prized education, achievement and Christian values. She was considerably younger than her four older siblings. Her mother was a warm, nurturing evangelical Christian from Alabama, her father a caring but frequently absent Air Force engineer who eventually left the Air Force and worked on the Hubble telescope, at a distance from his familyIn the first half of her book, after sharing her experience of her mother's death, Tracy presents significant episodes from her childhood, many from when she was 8-9, and later, a few from high school and college. We view her on Halloween, dressed as a ghost in a costume that looked more like a Ku Klux Klan outfit than Casper or Spooky, and resulted in uncomfortably odd looks from candy-distributing benefactors. We travel with her to Alabama to visit her grandmother and to become aware of a milieu in which blacks have a distinctively inferior position.We see her navigate her way into a special MGM class Mentally Gifted Minors, tauntingly called Mentally Gifted Monkeys by excluded classmates. We experience with her the initial embrace of her Southern Baptist church-goings, but also her terror reading the book of Revelation and discovering that God could be cruel. Confusing too was her entry into a Christian youth study group which was oddly called ""Hot and Fast,"" but was too traditional for Tracy's questing mind. ""God is not that small,"" she wrote to herself on one occasion as she began to define her own religious beliefs (""I think of God as a current that runs through all that is"") as well as her identity as female, black, and talented.I was most moved by Tracy's self-aware and open sharing of her platonic ""love affair"" with one of her married high school teachers, a man who dared to confess his growing love for her and with whom she exchanged daily letters for many months. Inevitably, that relationship ended, as did her first few sexual relationships. Beginning to emerge from the warm, secure embrace of her family, Tracy was compelled to come to terms with the pain of loss and betrayal.""Pain. Somewhere it was never too far around the bend. When I was a child, I'd viewed its promise as part and parcel of the reverie of deep feeling. One day, I will house a tremendous heartache. One day, I will reel with a singular ecstasy.""At least  after each self-protective closing, there was always the promise of the next ecstasy.""Another function of sex.......to open up new depths within the self that can be filled just as easily with elation as with a merciless leaden sorrow.""During her college years at Harvard, Tracy discovered Afro-American studies and explored her racial identity.  She began to write poetry seriously, and continued to redefine her religious beliefs, separating from the Christianity of her upbringing and also her mother. But unfortunately, as Tracy entered and attended college, her mother struggled with cancer. As Tracy needed to separate and forge her own identity, she also had very compelling reasons to remain close to family.Coming full circle, she returns at the end of the book to her relationship with her mother, and the impact of her mother's death when she was still in her early twenties: ""The only thing to do, I suspected, would be to move over and learn to live beside the gulf left in my mother's wake, peering down into it at times out of need, but making every effort not to topple over and fall in.""During  her life, Tracy also learned the importance of telling one's story: ""Silence feeds pain, allows it to fester and thrive. What starves pain, what forces it to release its grip, is speech, the voice upon which rides the story......Telling the story bolstered my sense of hurt and anger..... Yet it also tamed the pain, giving it a shape, a beginning, middle, and eventually, an end.""In ORDINARY LIGHT, Tracy opens her heart as she guides her readers through her most poignant experiences and eventual fulfillment in love, motherhood and passion for writing.  Her  touching memoir is written with gentle self-awareness, the words lyrically crafted into prose and imparted with the sensitive skill of a poet and the flowing intimacy of an engaging storyteller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MKF44YNTKWIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307962660#wasThisHelpful","R1MKF44YNTKWIT","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not familiar with either Badiou or Fienkielkraut when I chose to read and review CONFRONTATION. My aim was to stretch beyond my U.S.-centric political awareness and become more knowledgeable about the political issues of concern in Europe today.Reading CONFRONTATION indeed was very helpful in this regard, despite my lack of familiarity with some of the names and historical references, and the frequent use in the book of academic terminology. Understanding the perspective presented is challenge but a satisfying one for the newcomer to these well-known French thinkers, as well as to their fans and followers.Alain Badiou is a philosophy professor emeritus in France, known for his far left Marxist orientation, and his support of universalism as well as a revitalized communism. He is also a defender of the Palestinians and the rights of  immigrants. He is very concerned about the consequences of ""the world everywhere under the control of an extremely close-knit network of financial and media oligarchies that impose a rigid model of development do so at the price of crises and never-ending wars.""Alain Finkielkraut is a conservative French professor of the History of Ideas, a left wing Zionist who believes in a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, who deplores multiculturalism and mourns the weakening of traditional French (and human) values. ""All the degradation of the modern world, i.e. all lowering of standards, all debasement of values,"" he says, ""comes from the modern world regarding as negotiable the values that the ancient Christen worlds regarded as non-negotiable. And this universal negotiation is the cause of its universal degradation.""Four hours in length, this transcribed and edited debate is divided into four segments: National Identity and Nations; Judaism, Israel and Universalism; May '68; and Communism (Past and Future).One focus of discussion is the importance of national identity (French) which Finkielkraut fully supports vs. a greater identification with multicultural and global concerns.  In another discussion, Badiou defends and explains the original ideals of communism in contrast to totalitarian communism of 20th century Russia and China.  In another debate, Finkielkraut claims that Badiou blames Israel for the Mideast conflict and increasing anti-Semitism in Europe, whereas Badiou claims that Finkielkraut is too quick to blame radical Islam.In my opinion, these two esteemed thinkers are not as polarized as they appear initially to be. In much of their debate, they label each other or characterize the other as holding a more extreme view than he does. The accused then defends himself, and in turn often labels the accuser. But there are a few circumstances in which they appear to fully hear each other, and to acknowledge their agreement with the other person's assertions.Personally, I found myself shifting my support of arguments presented by each of these the thinkers, favoring initially the more liberal views of Badiou but also finding him too pie-in-the-sky impractical. On the other hand, I believed Finkielkraut to be more realistic and grounded, but unable to come to terms with some of the changes that have occurred in today's world. However, he staunchly defends important values which indeed are being quickly eroded.All in all, this is a stimulating debate, likely to be thought-provoking both to readers who are familiar with the issues raised by these thinkers as well as those who are newcomers to their points of view.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GA8HXQL383EM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745685706#wasThisHelpful","R3GA8HXQL383EM","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""He had joined the air force because James wanted the height and distance of the plane in relation to the ground. 'So I don't have to see the people I'm killing,' he had said to his sister, Enid.""James had been an elementary level teacher, and although lacking the temperament for war, became an RAF officer for Britain during WWII. When his plane was shot down and he became a prisoner of war in Germany, he spent his time in the POW camp observing and recording the behavior of birds  the redstarts just outside the barbed wire fence enclosing the camp. Aware that many letters prisoners sent to their loved ones were heavily censored, and perhaps also not wanting to dwell on the realities of being a prisoner, James filled his letters to your new, young bride Rose with observations of redstarts.Rose, age 22, who barely knew her 32 year old husband when the war began, is bored by his letters and allows herself to fall in love with and have an affair with a married man. But to complicate matters, James' older sister Enid arrives at Rose's country cottage, having lost her flat, her belongings, her job and her lover in a recent London bombing. Enid has nowhere else to go.The separate and intertwining experiences of James, Rose and Enid  as well as some of James interactions at the POW camp (most notably with the German Kommandant who is supportive of James' bird observations) provide the substances of this straightforward, easy-to-read, and gently touching novel.  Since the 290 pages of the book have been formatted with relatively large type and considerable space between lines (with 240 words per page rather than the standard 400+ words per page) it is really quite a brief novel, almost a novella.Although weak in action and slow in plot, THE EVENING CHORUS is a quick read. It is sad but not depressing, reflective but not profound. Only one statement about a character struck me as particularly insightful, lending some dimension to Enid, who was not drawn in much depth considering the traumatic experiences that had recently shaped her:""Enid thinks that this is precisely what words are for  to change what was awful into something you can live with. She had a made a new story of her affair with Oliver Matheson....Enid has even told the story out loud several times, and she is surprised to find that something that played such a large part in her younger life takes only the length of one gin and tonic to disclose.""The first 2/3 of the novel occur in 1940. These chapters may be realistic, but I found the circumstances of James ' imprisonment in a POW to be a bit unbelievable due the kindness of the Kommandant and the life of leisure that the prisoners led. But perhaps in those camps which did respect the Geneva convention and were manned by German officers who were not aggressive by nature, such relatively benign imprisonments did occur.Although most of the book takes place in 1940, the last third skips ahead ten years to 1950. Unfortunately, because we miss out on the characters' lives during the intervening years, the changes in their circumstances ring a bit hollow and are less engaging than the first two thirds of the book.Given how much of the book focused on James' study of birds (with additional study of plant life by Enid), I also think that the book might have benefited by having facsimile illustrations and entries from James' journals, including his own drawings of redstarts and a few color pictures of them. If illustrations had been included, the reader might more fully appreciate James' focus upon his bird observations which preoccupied him instead of plans for escape. But even without illustrations, the segments pertaining to James' bird study reveal his gentle, but purposeful nature and set the stage for the growing schism between himself and his wife.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G5MJKHADJC0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544348699#wasThisHelpful","R3G5MJKHADJC0X","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Kate Spade watch, which I received rather than purchased, has too large a watch face and watchband for my tiny wrists, but having a jeweler remove several of the band segments is easy. Women who prefer large watch faces are likely to love this watch  it has a simple and casual elegance which makes it wearable for many occasions.The watch face itself has a clear silver-white background, with straight silver line markers rather than numbers indicating each hour. Another silver marker keeps track of seconds. At the 3:00 position, a small inset indicates the day of the month, which (like the time) is easy to set. However, since there is no indicator for setting the month, and months vary in length, you will need to change the day setting every month or so.The watch face is encircled with tiny gleaming crystals.  The watchband is shiny, metallic and mirror-like. Its width is 18mm and its length 7.85 inches. The watch has stopwatch capability, which I personally do not need but those who need a stopwatch will find its operation explained in the stylishly designed user guide that has text in half a dozen languages. The battery lasts about two years.My primary concern about this watch  apart from it being larger than I prefer  is that it is water-resistant not waterproof.  It can withstand light rain and light splashes but not submersion in a shower or bathtub or prolonged exposure to steam. This, of course, means that you have to remember to take it off every time you shower  which may not always be easy to remember. Also, if you wear the watch snug against your wrist, it is not easy to unclasp, since the unclasping is along the underside of the watchband, against your wrist. This means that having to take it off for a daily shower can be a bit of a chore.It is, however, a very attractive, stylish watch, suitable for wearing on many different occasions. I most appreciate its casual elegance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDV7LDOIQCMCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087IWCBC#wasThisHelpful","RDV7LDOIQCMCA","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rabbit is born in 1975, during the last year of the American occupation of Vietnam. She has in fact been buried with her mother but is still alive when Huyan Honey and her daughter Qui dig her up out of the grave. It may well be that Rabbit's own burial in her first year of life give her an uncanny ability - to deeply enter her own silence and hear the voices of the dead. This ability of hers is one of the themes of the book, but is not presented in a way that enables the reader what Rabbit is experiencing.During the first part of the book, we are treated to a few flashbacks about her ancestry, particularly in regard to her grandmother Ba's attempts to survive the French occupation of Indochina after spending all her money agreement, which as it turned out, only allowed to her to do backbreaking work in service to the French.Much of the story occurs around 1975-76, soon after the Americans have left Vietnam. Rabbit, her father Tu, Huyan Honey and Qi along with a number of others including Cambodians appear to be fleeing South Vietnam for North Vietnam. Throughout this journey, we also are told stories of others who suffered during the war and were captured by enemy forces.We move forward to time to when Rabbit is a young adult and some events which occur then, such as her love affair with a Russian and an attack by pirates. We also learn about the experience of An, a friend of Rabbit's father, who was punished for his role in the war and experienced firsthand the cruelty of the North Vietnamese guards.I struggled continually to read and understand this novel, but ultimately gave up 2/3 of the way through it. Wanting to enjoy it, I kept rereading passages, hoping to better understand the plot and make deeper connections to the stories and characters. But I found too many gap in the plot interfering with my ability to understand what was happening, and the characters were cardboard characters who never came alive on the page. As a result, I cannot recommend this novel.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R233ZV0UDKDJ4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307911772#wasThisHelpful","R233ZV0UDKDJ4M","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazon offered me this sturdy Oxo collapsible dish drainer to review only minutes after the plastic utensil holder broke off my previous dish drainer, so I immediately started using the Oxo as soon as it arrived. I live in a small apartment in a very old building, with only two feet of open counter space for a dish drainer and cutting board, and no dishwasher, so I handwash and drain my dishes three or four times a day.Unfortunately, however, this dish drainer at 20x16 is slightly larger than my previous one, but doesn't hold as many dishes.  What is most frustrating is that it has holder space for only four cups and glasses (with two sets of five prongs too close together so that two are needed for each glass and the ones on the end are useless) . If you have some very narrow but not tall glasses (tall glasses fall over on the short holder plugs), you may be able to make space for six, but not with standard glass sizes.In contrast, the six silverware holders (great for sorting forks, knives and spoons) hold over 60 pieces of silverware. I was pleased to discover that they can be removed. But removing one of the two sets of three utensil containers in order to free up more glass plugs accomplished little. The new visible glass plugs are right up against the plate holder area so that you would have to collapse the plate holders and not drain any plates in order to use them.Since I drink 12+ cups or glasses a day, and often drink smoothies instead of eating meals, I find this setup very limiting. Fortunately though, I  can use the open space next to the plate holder area for cups, though I prefer not to stack up glasses there.Also in regard to glasses, not only is the horizontal space a problem, but height is as well since the prongs are so short. My wine glasses keel over and lie almost flat on their sides when I try to place them on a glass prong. And in fact, most tall glasses keel over too, so there is no other option than to place them open side down in the larger drainage area.The plate area which holds six plates is suitable only for plates not bowls, unless one has very shallow bowls. I don't. So bowls as well as cups and tall glasses need to be drained in the open area, which (when the plate and glass holders are in use) is only 10"" x 10"". So basically,  there's only space for the dishes of one person for two small meals or two people for one small meal  and perhaps afternoon coffee or other drinks.What I do like about this dish drainer is that:a) it is made of very sturdy plastic which is likely to last for several years;b) it has metal handles which make it easy to lift and carry;c) the utensil holders don't fall over when full, and (praise be!) are not closed at the bottom so silverware can easily drain and the container remain clean;d) it is on a slant and has a plug that can be opened for easy draining into the sink if water accumulates;e) the plate rack folds down to make space in the open area , so that if you don't have plates but need space instead for glasses, bowls, lids etc., you can easily create space.Its collapsibility is another advantage although I'm not likely to take the time to fold it up and reassemble it unless I have no dishes to wash for a day or so and am desperate for more counter space.This drainer could have been better designed  with three rather than six utensil holders, and more glass holders (with taller plugs) spaced further apart so that the drainer could easily drain 8-10 cups or glasses rather than 4-6. For what you get, it's also considerably over-priced.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZVV8PW8FG24W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X6OKC#wasThisHelpful","RZVV8PW8FG24W","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These ultra-light packing cubes aren't really cubes  they're zippered bags  but they are ultra-light. The mesh on more than half of one side of the bags allow clothes to breathe, but wouldn't contain spills if you use the bag for toiletries. The double zipper allows you to partially open them, and the handles are helpful for carrying them, although I wouldn't trust them to hold up if they contain several heavy items.Although I find them useful, they are smaller than I expected, and pricey considering what you get. A set of three or four (including  two of the larger bags) would make more sense to me at this price.The small bag, which is actually considered ""medium"", is slightly smaller than a size of notebook paper, and is really only suitable for undies, bras, socks etc. or maybe a few t-shirts rolled or folded up small and ready for laundering. Although it's about the size of the toiletry bags I use for travel,  it's not viable  for liquids or creams that might spill or ooze. It could also be used for electric chargers, plugs etc. or other small pieces of equipment including small hair dryers, and is useful for keeping that sometimes hard-to-find equipment together. Apart from travel, it could be used for organizing and storage.The medium size bag which is considered to be ""large""  is 14 x 10.5 inches.  It can hold half a dozen folded blouses, or several pair of pants  and like the smaller bag, expands  to a larger size than you would initially believe because of its relatively shapeless form. It is actually quite useful for clothes, although I wouldn't put a dress or suit in it and expect it to maintain its shape or remain iron-free. Actually, it doesn't really have much advantage over plastic bags or ziploc bags.Although initially these bags look ideal for holding bathing suit, towel and other swim club paraphernalia, they aren't water-tight because of the mesh and therefore would not prevent a wet bathing suit or towel from leaking moisture over everything contained in a larger bag.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21K90KMD91C1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWWBLH0#wasThisHelpful","R21K90KMD91C1N","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In THE ART OF YOUTH, author Nicholas Delbanco examines the lives of three talented artists -  writer Stephen Crane, painter Dora Carrington, and musician George Gershwin - all who died by the age of 38. He also includes an autobiographical chapter about himself, apparently considering himself to have been a child prodigy as well, but this chapter does not seem to belong to the book, since he is not as noteworthy as these three artists, and he clearly did not die young.I was not very familiar with Stephen Crane, but previously knew about Carrington from watching the film Carrington starring Emma Thompson. I had long appreciated Gershwin's music - and been intrigued by him also because we share the same birthday and a similar ancestry. Having personally experienced the peak of my own creative success when I was a teenager, I was hoping that the author Delbanco would have insights to share about early but truncated creativity. However, he only pointed out half a dozen of the obvious characteristics that these three artists had in common such as creative energy, ambition, early support, and a self-absorption combined with an outward focus.Stephen Crane started writing poetry at the age of four, and published his second and most famous novel, Red Badge of Courage, when he was only 23. He wrote ceaselessly but did not take care of himself physically, suffered from a GI disease and died of a brain tumor when he was only 28.Dora Carrington was a portrait and landscape painter. While DelBanco focuses on the creative outpouring of Crane and Gershwin, he appears to assume that since Carrington was female, that her relationships should be the focus rather than her creative work. Indeed, her love affairs and friendships are intriguing and unusual - especially her lifelong platonic love affair with her live-in companion, homosexual Lytton Strachey. But DelBanco could have shown Carrington the same respect he showed the two men by fully acquainting the reader with her work. Although I've watched the film about her and read this brief biography, I still know little about approach to painting or her specific works of art.George Gershwin was born to a poor Russian Jewish family, originally named Gershowitz. His father's unstable work history led the family to be constantly moving, but his parent encouraged the musical talents of their children. From an early age, Gershwin was obsessed with music - hearing, playing, performing, composing. At the age of 23, he composed Rhapsody in Blue, followed by American in Paris and Porgy and Bess. Gershwin enjoyed immense popularity. When he died of a brain tumor at the age of 38, there was a national outpouring of grief and many memorial concerts.Although I was pleased to learn about these three artists, I found the author's approach to them dry and tedious. Delbanco takes a distancing, external perspective on these three artists, presenting facts about their lives, but not providing any sense of their inner selves or revealing enough about their personalities to bring them to life on the page. The book is short but because it is not at all emotionally engaging or intellectually stimulating, it did not hold my interest. I rate it three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131CR0LZXJK92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544114469#wasThisHelpful","R131CR0LZXJK92","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Boyd Varty grew up on the Londolozi Game Reserve in South Africa, in a family dedicated to respecting and protecting wild animals, while also leading safaris.  Londolozi, which in Zulu means protector of all things, was founded by Varty's great grandfather and has been run by four generations of family members. It is one of the most well-known game reserves in the world, and was even visited by Nelson Mandela soon after he was released from prison.In the first half of Cathedral in the Wild, Varty shares many of his early and recent experiences with the animals of Africa  leopard, lions, elephants, impalas and many more. Most of his anecdotes  are fascinating, and relate to experiences of deep bonding with wild animals or surviving dangerous encounters, particularly with cobras and crocodiles. Some of the experiences he shares are laugh-aloud funny. For example:""Jamu had a passion for toilet paper rolls. She would steal ours out of the latrine and in usual leopard fashion, hoist it into the branches of the sausage tree....After a few hours, Jamu had the tree looking like a frat house after a hideous keg party.""Throughout the book, Varty also, in conversational and often witty prose, tells us some of what he has learned about African animals. For example, elephants have a low frequency communication that human ears can't hear. Zebras have stripes to confuse predators, who can't tell where one zebra ends and another begins. One family member taught him: ""In the bush you never panic. When you panic, your brain turns to sponge.....Always have an escape route.""In the second half of the book, Varty focuses more on the difficulties he and his family faced  a lawsuit in regard to a tiger-related project that was prolonged for many years (although he doesn't give enough details for the reader to understand the nature of the charges), and a traumatic experience which resulted in PTSD symptoms, not only for him but also other family members. He also took time off to travel, and attempted to heal himself through visiting a Master in India, participating in a sweat lodge ceremony in Arizona, and living in the African jungles learning to track from a native tracker.The last few chapters are particularly moving, as Varty shares some inspiration and insights he gained both away from Londolozi and at Londolozi experiencing profound closeness to nature and animals. ""I'd found safety again in nature and in my own heart in the cathedral of the wild,"" Varty tells us.During his long process of healing from trauma, he began to perceive the connections between working with wild animals and healing both oneself and the planet : ""If we want to restore the planet, we must first restore ourselves. I believe that you find your way to your right life, your mission, the same way you find an animal. First, quiet your heart and be still. Then find the fresh track and be willing to follow it. You don't need to see the whole picture; you only need to see where to take the next step. Life isn't about staying on track; it's about constantly rediscovering the track.""The Cathedral of the Wild is an engaging and amazing narrative about an African habitat , which may feel like another world to many readers, as it did to me. But it also fascinating, amusing and mind-expanding. Varty openly shares his own adventures and introduces us to some of his family members, including his colorful, obsessed filmmaker Uncle John who is known for many of his nature documentaries.We also are given at glimpse of some of the native Shangaan and Masai tribal members who are expert trackers or working with animals in the reserve   and treated almost like family by the Vartys. Both during apartheid years and the turbulent first decade after apartheid was abolished, Londolozi was a rare sanctuary of cooperation between tribal blacks and South African whites.Through Varty's eyes we experience an African thunderstorm, the calming presence of elephants, lions pouncing upon their prey and ripping it apart, the madcap life of a wildlife filmmaker, the raising of orphaned lions or leopards, and so much more. The Cathedral of the Wild  captures wild Africa in all its glory, danger, oddities, and magnificence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IMI3C9FXY1SM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069858#wasThisHelpful","R1IMI3C9FXY1SM","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This brief but informative biography is ideal for readers interested in Van Gogh who won't want to read a more extensive life history. Bell's prose is readable  not dry, but not lyrical or memorable. My primary issue with the book is the lack of reproductions of many of the paintings discussed  I had to rely on the Internet to locate those which on available online. The superb CGFAartonline site and Van Gogh site are at least helpful in this regard.Although I had read  Irving Stone's biography LUST OF LIFE  probably three decades ago  I did not remember many details about Van Gogh's life and was intrigued to learn that he only painted for ten years before committing suicide, and that initially, his painting interests were primarily peasants and coalminers.Along with painting, Van Gogh had a passion for prostitutes, and contracted syphilis and gonorrhea, which most likely contributed to his mental illness. He completed some of his well-known paintings when he was institutionalized, even painting the cypress trees that were visible through the bars of his room.Bell also clearly allows us to perceive Van Gogh's unstable bipolar temperament, marked by bouts of rage and depression. His difficult selling his painting and dependence upon his brother Theo (excerpts of some of his letters to Theo are included) for financial support were major sources of conflict for him. Van Gogh was never able to hold down a job or support himself for more than a few weeks at a time.Author Julian Bell is a painter himself, and most excels in conveying Van Gogh's attitudes toward painting  particularly his fascination with bold, intense color, and shifts back and forth between painting from imagination and directly painting from reality. I also appreciated Bell's brief discussions of a few dozen of Van Gogh's paintings (especially Starry Night), and the context Bell provided regarding the Parisian art scene of the late 19th century. Toulouse-Lautrec and Gauguin were two of the other painters in France who significantly influenced Van Gogh.VAN GOGH: A POWER SEETHING is a good but not great biography. Readers wishing to know more about Van Gogh's life and art are likely to enjoy it and find it informative, although most will undoubtedly  prefer a biography which includes  has reproductions of many of Van Gogh's most famous paintings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DCHCC93RDKP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544343735#wasThisHelpful","R3DCHCC93RDKP4","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have visited NYC half a dozen times in the past few decades,  mostly in order to see museums, bookstores and shows. Since I travel light but rely a lot on guidebooks, I am grateful for the compact yet comprehensive Pocket NYC from Lonely Planet, which will undoubtedly accompany me during my next trip.The book is superbly designed and easy to navigate. Most of it is divided into chapters by neighborhoods:  Lower Manhattan and the Financial District;  Soho and Chinatown;  East Village and the Lower East Side; Greenwich Village, Chelsea and the Meatpacking District; Union Square, Flatiron and Gramercy; Midtown Manhattan; Upper East Side; Upper West Side and Central Park. The largest chapters are the ones on Greenwich Village and Midtown.Brief highlights are also provided for Harlem, South Brooklyn and Williamsburg, but the book primarily covers Manhattan. As a result, I was disappointed that it neglected a few notable cultural sites outside Manhattan which interest me, such as the Brooklyn Museum.Each neighborhood chapter, however, is packed with useful color-coded information, and includes a two-age map. Following ""Best of NYC"" section on the most recommended sites in each neighborhood, the guidebook then provides details on more sites related to eating, drinking, museums, entertainment, and shopping, with price codes, addresses, urls, phone, hours, and subway information. Some special features  such as brief article on the architectural design of the New Museum in East Village  appear throughout the book.I am particularly pleased that in addition to well-known sites, Pocket New York City introduces lesser-known sites, many which I've added to my to-do list for my next trip. Some of those are: The Morgan Library, Mahayana Temple, Phillip Williams Posters, Ellis Island Immigration Museum, the NY Theater Workshop, The Fashion Institute's Costume Museum (first priority  I had no idea that existed!), the Conservatory Garden, Village Vanguard Jazz, and the shopping experience at the Hasidic-owned B&H Photo.In addition to the neighborhood chapters, this Lonely Planet guidebook includes a quick start section, and a survival guide with tips about transportation, money-saving, basic do's and don'ts, and more.  Over 30 pages are also devoted to NYC's Best by category  walks, nightlife, ""with kids"", LGBT, sports, parks, tours, ""for free"" etc. The full-size large folded detachable map of Manhattan is particularly useful.Since visitors to NYC have various interests, a pocket guidebook (even one that is 256 pages) which attempts to appeal to a wide range of visitors cannot cover any one category in depth. This book is particularly lacking in hotel information, but a visitor carrying around a pocket guidebook is likely (hopefully) to have arranged accommodations in advance. But this guidebook attempts to provide the highlights with details and recommendations in just about all possible categories (and for all budgets), and succeeds in doing so. If it included every site which might appeal to tourists, it would be the size of the Manhattan phone directory, and not a pocket guide!For its size, POCKET NEW YORK CITY packs a considerable amount of useful information into a small space without sacrificing readability. I rate it five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AJKO05UWTXTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742208878#wasThisHelpful","R2AJKO05UWTXTF","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ON TWO FEET AND WINGS, Iranian Abbas Kazerooni tells the true story of his surviving alone when only nine years old in Istanbul.During the Iran/Iraq war, boys were drafted by the age of nine  which usually meant an early death.  Because the parents of Abbas had supported the Shah, they lost almost everything when the Shah was deposed, and faced restrictions on their freedom as well. To keep Abbas from being drafted, they intended to accompany him to Turkey and help him get a visa to England, so that he might live there with an Iranian cousin. But their plans went awry, and Abbas found himself alone in Istanbul.Without knowing either Turkish or English, Abbas  had to find accommodations and support himself during the long and complicated bureaucratic process of applying for a visa. His father had sold everything (even the beds!) in their house in order to buy plane tickets and raise the money Abbas would need living in a cheap hotel in Turkey for many weeks or months of waiting. On a tight budget (one meal a day), the terrified but amazingly clever and resourceful Abbas befriended the hotel clerk Marat and devised schemes  playing backgammon for money, shining shoes  in order to pay for food and lodgings.ON TWO FEET AND WINGS is not only likely to appeal to children nine years and older. Abbas' heartfelt narration is also likely to move adults. I personally was deeply touched, and wished I could have met and comforted him during this time. Although Kazerooni wrote and published his book decades after his experience (the first edition, called Little Man, was actually published in 2005), he was still able to capture the feelings of a child alone in a foreign country  the fear, loneliness, and longing for parents and home. Clearly, Abbas's father prepared him well, for Abbas' knowledge of what to expect and what he needed to do combined with his almost unbelievable courage, intelligence and resourcefulness, is impressive.But more than knowledge and cleverness was required. Abbas had to continually decide who to trust, how much to share of his circumstances, and how to protect the money he carried in his pockets. He had to budget, eating only one meal a day, resisting temptation. He had to cope with the feelings aroused by a few dangerous encounters. Fortunately, his own remarkable circumstances and precociousness helped him to attract the goodwill of Iranians in Istanbul, as well as Turks who spoke Farsi and legitimately wanted to help him.Abbas Kazerooni's childhood experience was remarkable, and his narration of it, written simply but coherently from a child's perspective, is emotionally engaging. This is the perfect book for a family to read together and discuss. It is also likely to inspire children coping with new and difficult circumstances to look within and discover their own courage and capabilities.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VRC8MPI5CEV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147782037X#wasThisHelpful","R3VRC8MPI5CEV1","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bose Soundtouch 3.0 wifi music system is a sleek compact system with superb rich, full sound in treble, midrange and bass. Once I survived the setup process of connecting to my pc and home wifi (more later in this review), I found it easy to access any of the 20,000 different worldwide Internet radio stations available and was impressed with the sound.  Immediately, I looked up Portugal stations, and started checking out a few dozen in search of fado music (my current passion). You could probably spend the rest of your life checking out all the radio stations available to you here. Being able to search by music keyword, however, would be helpful.What I particularly like, apart from the quality of the sound, is that users can preset up to six stations and access any of them via buttons atop the system without having to connect to one's computer or device. I rely on the Bose software with my PC, but users can also connect via Airplay and access the system via Android, smartphone, Iphone, Ipad or Android (although streaming is not available via Android devices). Presets may be accessed not only for radio but also for playlist (Internet-based or personal music collection but not cds), although the playlist choices are limited.First, the playlists for online services using the Bose software are only for Iheartradio (limited to certain localities, and not my state of Massachusetts), Pandora, Spotify and Deezer, but accessing playlists for the latter three seem to require paid-for premium accounts which I was not willing to purchase. The Hearts of Space service, to which I do subscribe, is not supported by Bose. YouTube also is not available.Second, you can connect to your personal playlist on your computer but only if you created playlists with ITunes or Windows media player and are connected to the computer that contains the music files and playlist (not a smartphone, tablet, Iphone or Ipad).  The files can also only be access if in the official folder for My Music or ITunes Music.If you're using a personal computer and not relying on WiFi, you can use the cable which is provided to connect from the auxiliary outlet on the Bose system to audio on your computer. Bose provides a power cord, USB cable (for computer use only) and remote control for your use.I did not have playlists created in either ITunes or Window media player, and had to spend several hours creating them and transferring them and all my music files to my Windows 7 laptop since my music files were on my Windows XP desktop computer. I was not able to connect the Bose system to my XP desktop, although it supposedly is compatible with Windows XP.Users who are very tech savvy or who have considerable experience setting up music systems most likely will find setup much easier than I did. From the start, I was frustrated that virtually no instructions were provided apart from a card with a few brief steps in large type for connecting via a smartphone or tablet, neither of which I have. On the back of the card, however, in very small type, are brief, incomplete instructions for setup via Airplay,  computer or another mobile device.Considering the cost of this music system, Bose could at least have provided instructions of more than 150 words that specify the initial steps for getting started. The brief instructions provided tell you to ""connect the device and SoundTouch system to the same Wi-Fi network"" and ""Select correct network name and enter password"" without even telling you that after you turn on the system and connect your device or computer, that if you are using a computer you have to download the software. Of course, Bose doesn't even tell you what software or where you get it.I finally figured out that I needed to go to bose.com, look up my system, click on customer service, and find the link at the bottom of the screen to the user's guide so that I could download it. The user guide which tells you these steps but you have to figure them out on your own in order to access it  as well as continue with setup. And in fact, in the user guide, instructions for setting up the system via a computer are on the LAST page of the guide in the appendix.At least a USB cable is provided so you can connect to your computer and access the Bose site from there, and Youtube has a few excellent tutorials on setting up this system, which I relied on (at a friend's suggestion) before I was able to locate any of the Bose help online.Apart from relying on the User Guide, you can follow the instructions IN the user guide to go to Soundtouch.com/app in order to download the software, launch it and complete the setup instructions, as well as manage  your sound system.In retrospect, I realize that I probably could have saved time by contacting Bose tech support initially, I had chosen to set up and start to use the system on a major holiday.In short, I am happy with the quality of sound, thousands of radio stations, and presets. Initially, I was not happy with setup, lack of included software or user guide. And I am still not happy with the limited options in regard to accessing playlists, either in regard to streaming OR accessing one's own musical collection. But for what it does, this is a fine system, so I rate it four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OAJ56AZ43GY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGK89FY#wasThisHelpful","R1OAJ56AZ43GY1","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During the first half of his previously unpublished novel SKYLIGHT, Nobel Prize writer Jose Saramago introduces us to the working class apartment dwellers in an apartment building in 1950s Lisbon.We meet an elderly couple who take in the boarder Abel, the kept woman Lidia and her lover Paulino, and the Spanish Carmen who despises her husband Emilio and battles for the affection of their son Henri. We are introduced to the middle-aged sisters Adriana and Isaura and their interfering aunts, the sadistic Caetano and his contemptuous wife Justina, and finally, Rosalia, who hopes that Lidia's wealthy lover will employ her 19 year old daughter.Reading SKYLIGHT at four separate sittings during one week, I found that each time I picked up the novel I had to reacquaint myself with the characters. There are too many introduced early in the novel  as many as four per apartment. Making a diagram of the apartment building, listing and identifying each resident, was helpful. The chapters alternate, each dealing with one set of residents, providing initially unrelated vignettes of six families, without any central plot. Midway through the book, I would have rated the novel three stars.But then, suddenly, the stories deepen. Each one presents a dramatic conflict and lets us perceive more fully the inner dynamics of the characters. Some subplots are tawdry, even ugly  in particular, the hostility, revenge-seeking and even sexual exploitation occurring for two of the couples. It may have been reality in 1950s Portugal that a wife had no right of refusal in regard to her husband's advances, but I found this reality particularly disturbing.Justina, who scorned her husband and welcomed his affairs is shocked and confused by her reaction to his unexpected desire for her:  ""She had never been thrown, as then, into the maelstrom of pleasure, with all ties broken, all frontiers crossed. What for other women was an ascent into the heavens for her was a fall....Justina moved between those two poles  newly awakened desire and the desire to be in control. One excluded the other.""Sex is also central to the concerns of Lidia's lover Paulo, and to one of the sisters, whose repressed sexuality suddenly surfaces.The story that most captured my attention, which I believe is the most brilliantly crafted and meaningful, is that of the elderly cobbler Sylvestre  intelligent and self-educated  and his deepening friendship with his young boarder, Abel. Searching for meaning in life, Abel is challenged by the one-time political activist, Sylvestre.""We won't become what we are meant to be in life by listening to other people's words or advice. We have to feel in our own flesh the wound that will make us into proper men,"" Sylvestre tells Abel. Sylvestre, who is happily married, believes in ""loving each other with a lucid, active love, a love that can overcome hatred."" His philosophy is that ""we should be fully engaged with life, each individual should reach out beyond himself. Being merely present isn't enough. Being a mere witness is tantamount to being dead.""But Abel feels lost in regard to his own path. ""How to reach out? And where to?....THERE'S a problem that throws up a thousand other problems.... there's a thousand answers to the 'how' and the 'where'.""Whereas I rate the first half of SKYLIGHT three stars, I rate the second half 4  stars. My only criticisms of  the second half pertain to the ugly soap opera of the two hostile couples, and a second anonymous letter sent to one characters  I felt as if readers were meant to understand the source of this letter and the motive for sending it, but this plot element escaped my understanding. I also wish the novel has a more conclusive ending.But Saramago excels at both characterization and dialogue. The translator, Margaret Jull Costa, conveys his precisely crafted yet natural language.  You do not need to be familiar with Saramago's later work  - I wasn't  to appreciate his skill as a writer in SKYLIGHT.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P7CKRY1UAMNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544090020#wasThisHelpful","R2P7CKRY1UAMNV","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of the hundreds of books I've read and reviewed for Amazon, many have been excellent and emotionally engaging. But only a few are, in my opinion, truly great. THE NIGHTINGALE is one of those rare great novels you are not likely to forget. When I finished reading it, I experience a sense of awe, the kind of silent reverence one might feel in a cathedral, or viewing Michelangelo's David.In THE NIGHTINGALE, author Kristin Hannah convincingly portrays life in occupied France during WWII from the points of view of two very different sisters - ""Viann, the rule follower and Isabelle the rebel....Everything she did, she did full speed ahead, no brakes.""When Paris is occupied and Isabelle flees to the village where Viann lives with her husband and daughter, we suspect that Isabelle is not going to submit willingly to the Nazi occupation. Indeed, she does not. She becomes the Nightingale, the daring Resistance leader, sought by the Nazis, known for transporting hundreds of downed British air pilots (and other persons wanted by the Nazis) by foot across the Pyrenees. She also falls in love with a Resistance fighter whose life is also at risk.Participating in the Resistance was dangerous not only to oneself, but also to one's family. The Nazis killed those who were suspected of giving aid, and their relatives. Not only Isabelle but also Viann was continually faced with difficult choices. How much risk should each take in rescuing allied servicemen, protecting Jews, or saving the lives of orphaned children? At what point should they choose safety over principles? At what point will they be unwilling to compromise their principles? When is the wisest course of action cooperation or even collaboration?When Viann's husband is imprisoned by the Nazis and German officer is billeted in her home, Viann is faced with dilemmas she never anticipated. Avoiding good vs. evil stereotypes, Hannah portrays officer Beck as basically a good, kindhearted man who is compelled to obey orders which he does not support. The challenge that both he and Viann face as she resists their developing friendship is particularly moving, and likely to lead the reader to question how he or she might react in Viann's situation.Viann's circumstances are also complicated by Isabel's dangerous comings and goings, and Viann's close friendship with a Jewish family - Rachel and her children. At this time, more and more Jews are being deported to ""work camps"" to fulfill Nazi quotas. Beck warns Viann, ""They are not deporting French Jews....Yet."" But circumstances keep changing, and as much as Beck wishes to protect Viann, he is a German officer afraid of the Gestapo.Conflicted, Viann consults her Mother Superior, who tells her, ""Think about who you are and what sacrifices you can live and what will break you...The path of righteousness is often dangerous.""THE NIGHTINGALE actually does not begin with Viann and Isabelle's story but rather begins more than fifty years later with an elderly woman locating the identification card of Juliette Gervais. Juliette was the fake identity of the notorious Nightingale, Isabelle. Had this woman herself once been Isabel and buried her past? Hannah wisely avoids revealing her identity until the end of the novel.Meanwhile, we are drawn into the lives of other characters as well - the sisters' inhospitable father who owns a Paris bookstore and eventually works at the German high command, Viann's daughter Sophie, Rachel's son ""Daniel"", Isabel's lover Gaeta, and the cruel and sadistic Nazi, Von Richter.Kristin Hannah has a remarkable talent for creating characters who seem to live and breathe so that you forget you are reading words as you envision their lives. Most novels, even the best ones, have noticeable flaws - weak characters, holes in the plot, awkward dialogue, but THE NIGHTINGALE is that rare novel that is crafted to perfection and yet has a natural flow that captures attention from start to finish. It is likely to be one of the most highly acclaimed novels of 2015.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R337AKG2AYJX4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312577222#wasThisHelpful","R337AKG2AYJX4J","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE TOP TEN THINGS THAT DEAD PEOPLE NEED TO TELL YOU is mistitled. It is not about the messages from another plane channeled by psychics, or from people who have briefly died and had actual after-death experiences. In fact, the book might have been more accurately titled NEW AGE THINKING FOR DUMMIES, for indeed that's what it is.I don't mean to imply that there is not some (probably) valid information about the next plane in this book - although of course, no one can know for sure. But the manner in which author Mike Dooley imparts these teachings -a compilation of new age thinking he has gleaned from dozens of sources, without crediting the sources - is seriously flawed.Personally, I also found his conversational writing style grating - a combination of condescending, artificially hip, and ""mickey mouse"". I read every word in the book, but his invention of many fake cheery ""letters from the dead"" as well as some of his sentences made me cringe, and yearn for meat and potatoes rather than more whipped cream and marshmallow:""As you stir in thoughts, winds begin to howl.""""As you smile, waves of love lap upon eternal beaches.""""Dearest darling, those who have passed see better than ever that dreams really can come true.""Gag. And I am a romantic, with a deeply spiritual approach to life and belief in reincarnation - but not a fondness for saccharine cliches. I also don't believe that evil does not exist, and that everything that happens to us is a result of our thoughts or part of some benign cosmic plan. What about natural laws? Chaos theory? The uncertainty principle? What about genocide, concentration camps, torture, rape? According to Dooley, people really choose to be victims of such atrocities. I don't know what planet Mike Dooley lives on, but it is not the earth I know.What do the dead want to tell us according to Mike Dooley (And how does he know, anyway?)?  ""Love is all... ....Everyone is doing their best and is of good intent"" ......It's all good and all God....There is no evil other than what I choose to see.""Even near the end of the book, where Dooley presents false assumptions, the underlying reality they avoid, and alternatives we should substitute, Dooley implies that if we think materialism can be corrupting, then we are covering up ""I don't like being human/alive"" -  the actual truth is that ""money is pure spirit"". Tell that to my landlord and the IRS.  We may experience an abundance of spiritual wealth during this incarnation but it is not a viable means of barter on the earth plane.In all fairness:  A lot of what Dooley writes is congruent with concepts espoused by well-known psychics in the last century, as well as personal growth practitioners who have focused considerably on intention and visualization (he could at least credit them). Some of Dooley's aphorisms, which have floated around the new age world since the 1970s may indeed be valid:  ""To create anything in the physical world, it must first exist in the unseen."" ""Free will reins, but logically individuals must operate within the collective's massive range of probabilities.""It may well be that we each have a greater Self beyond our conscious self in this lifetime, one that chooses the nature of each lifetime and lessons to be learned. It may well be that our experience of the afterlife is influenced by our expectations in regard to it, and that suicides cannot escape their pain and will have to face it again in another lifetime. It may well be that defining what we want, envisioning it and being open to receive it can increase the odds that we will attract - the universe, Dooley says, does the rest. (But there is no guarantee that the everyone else's ""principle of attraction"" may be in harmony with others and that our intention will prevail and our visions will manifest.)One of the difficulties of this book is that the concepts that might be most meaningful to readers are like candles burning on a cake, candles that sink so deep into the frosting that their flame is extinguished by three inches of orange and pink sugar fluff.If you are seeking a sugar high, THE TOP TEN THINGS DEAD PEOPLE WANT TO TELL YOU may be just the icing on the cake that you want to ingest. But will it provide the substance, the nutrition that you need in order to better grapple with the very real obstacles and limitations of life on earth? And are you able to cope with the sugar crash that is likely to follow?","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30PPG2J4GFDJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401945562#wasThisHelpful","R30PPG2J4GFDJ3","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I intended to use the Griot's Microfiber pad for polishing my old, beat-up toyota after giving it a rare cleaning. But soon after my order arrived, I landed in the hospital and was eventually discharged in weakened condition, in no shape to polish my car.I also discovered that being 5'3"" with small hands that my hands with fingers spread are exactly the size of this 6.5"" diameter pad. It is impossible to stretch my hand around it to grip it, and I'm not about to  purchase a handstrap. I advise anyone (particularly women) with small hands to be aware of this issue and only purchase this pad to use on their car if they have a handstrap.So I decided to use this finishing pad in other ways  ways that it turned out were actually more important to me due to my being bothered for years by streaks, smudges and fingerprints that  never could successfully remove from half of a dozen items in my home.Success! It works perfectly removing smudges, streaks and fingerprints from my tv screen, computer screens, phone screen, two mirrors, and the mirror-like surface of my cd player. It also does a fair but not super-job of ridding of streaks on stand-alone glass. However, it was too big to reach into the crevices of a lattice-work style glass cabinet with 16 small glass panes.The finishing pad is high quality, and can undoubtedly survive many cleanings. It has a felt top area over a spongy middle area above the actual soft flexible surface used for cleaning. Apparently this is microfiber, but it looks like fluffy, soft black yarn about  inch high.You may not want to spend this much money to purchase this microfiber pad just for screens, mirrors and glass, but you might be pleased to know that it is very useful for other purposes besides polishing a car.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13YLWNEFVEF1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJ3BLQY#wasThisHelpful","R13YLWNEFVEF1G","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What if your soul/consciousness could be preserved when you're dying and returned to your body once your body was healed? What if it could be transferred to another body? Would the previous occupant's body influence your consciousness and behavior?What if a technology could enable this process, and be used for both noble and nefarious purposes?  Would only the rich have access to it? Would there be widespread religious objections?How much of our identity is consciousness and how much is the body, anyway? Would those who saw the light and returned to life want to die over and over again in order to re-experience that light?  Could a dead murder victim return in another body to testify against his killer?Would body theft become a new form of criminal behavior? Might recreational body-sharing become a new form of pleasure, with people able to experience bodies healthier or more physically capable than their own, or to get high on drugs on another person's body?To what extent might the government take control of the body-sharing industry and constructively use or misuse its power? What might happen when other countries  or terrorists  begin to adapt Soulminder for their own purposes?These are only some of the questions raised by SOULMINDER, a philosophical science fiction novel which thoroughly and brilliantly explores many ramifications of the technological development of this Soulminder process, although the book is mediocre as a work of fiction.The story begins as we learn that  Adrian Sommer (with business partner Jessica Sands) has developed Soulminder after the traumatic death of his five year old. His aim is completely well-intentioned. He wishes to circumvent death by keeping the soul (consciousness) alive and accessible while the body is kept functioning on machines as it is surgically repaired and healed. Then, the soul can be returned to it and the patient continue to live.Sands, however, has a different vision in mind  immortality. Why not be able to restore the soul to a younger, healthier body, and perhaps keep living in healthy bodies ad infinitum? But that is not the only possibility for Soulminder, and once objections to its existence are overcome, its possible uses began to expand and significantly influence individuals and society.Consider the beginnings of computers. Or the Internet. Who could have foreseen all the ways they are used now? The free open access to so much information, the speeding up of communication, the transcending of time and space  and yet cyber-theft and Internet addiction. This book may be about Soulminder but it also raises both practical and ethical issues in regard to the development of new influential technologies in general, and their potential for both good and evil.Fortunately, the philosophical speculation that SOULMINDER stimulates is so meaningful and fascinating that it succeeded in enabling me to forgive the second-rate craft. Except for Sommer, the characters are flat and one-dimensional  and even our perception of him is limited because we don't experience him apart from his relation to Soulminder. Author Zahn does not fully develop the religious opposition that is likely to occur, or explore what it's like to return to life or live  in another's body.He does, however, to a limited extent, describe the experience of being a disembodied soul  floating, sensing the presence of other bodiless entities, being drawn toward or away from a powerful light. One of his character says , ""Soulminder....It's just like purgatory. You're dead, but you can't get to heaven.""Because SOULMINDER was originally written as a series of  novellas, there is some disjunction between the chapters, which suddenly skip time periods and explore different dimensions of the expansion and uses of Soulminder. First, Soulminder succeeds in its initial testing and is further developed. Then it goes public and encounters the opposition of evangelists. Then, different uses and misuses of this consciousness-transfer technology begin to emerge and spread. The U.S. government seeks increasingly to take control, and  other countries begin to use the technology for their own purposes. Finally, Zahn returns to Sommer, who is now attempting to maintain control over Soulminder and prevent its continuing misuse.In the second half of the book, the main thread focusing on Sommer is lost for a considerable time, first due to a murder and detective story (which digresses far too much, and  should have been omitted), and second, to chapters exploring different Soulminder experiences of other persons not integral to the story. The personal vignettes are interesting because of the different perspectives they provide, although they are more like short-lived tributaries that do not influence the overall flow of the story.Although the third part of the book ricochets off from the more meaningful focus on Sommer's attempts to control the expansion of Soulminder, it does fully portray the unexpected and often frightening consequences of a technology that runs rampant in ways unforeseen by its developers (e.g. the atom bomb) and without ethical restraints.In the novel, Sommer says to a colleague, ""Soulminder is an archangel. I'm very afraid that it'll be beyond your ability to keep it from being a demon."" General Diaz, the novel's dictator of Chile states, ""It is now the hand that rocks the CASKET that rules the world.""I highly recommend SOULMINDER to those who like philosophical science fiction which explores the moral and ethical issues, and in particular the consequences of technology. The book stimulates considerable reflection, and would be a superb book for a book club oriented toward serious discussion. Yes, the writing craft is mediocre. But like Aldous Huxley's THE ISLAND, a novel which I read decades ago and remember as being visionary and meaningful although poorly written, SOULMINDER is substantial and significant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RYW1C6X9QEQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497646200#wasThisHelpful","R2RYW1C6X9QEQ6","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I only took these raspberry ketone capsules for a week due to severe gallbladder pain that may not be related to the capsules, but was exacerbated by them. The gallbladder digests fats, and these capsules are high performance fat-burning. I ordered them because I recently became hypothyroid, and had gained 20 pounds in recent years, which I was not able to lose.Due to an unfortunate coincidence, I started experiencing occasional digestive pain a few days after ordering these capsules - a problem I've had in the past and for which I take omeprazole on a regular basis. When the capsules arrived in the mail a week later, I was hesitant to take them for fear that they would worsen the digestive pain.Indeed, within a week of taking them, that is what happened.  And in fact,  I now have all the symptoms of a gallbladder infection, with severe debilitating pain and fever incapacitating me at least six hours a day. I have just had medical testing, and am now in the process of being treated for a serious infection.Anyone who experiences occasional or frequent digestive pain that may be gallbladder-related (and can be mistaken for stomach pain) should  consult with a doctor before deciding whether to ingest these capsules. Also, read carefully the safety information and legal disclaimer that appears on this site. DO NOT DO AS I DID AND TAKE A CHANCE WITH THESE CAPSULES IF YOU EXPERIENCE DIGESTIVE PAIN.I am rating these capsules one star due to my own experience, but recognize that healthy individuals with no history of digestive pain may find them helpful.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ5CS2O9JXJDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L88MPGK#wasThisHelpful","RJ5CS2O9JXJDP","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"GREAT MAPS is an extraordinary one-of-a-kind book published by the Smithsonian incomparable for the quality of its text and visuals, especially considering the low cost. Each of the 55 full-color historical maps (and Google Earth) are presented in a large 2-page spread with accompanying text. The initial map is followed by detailed close-up pictures of various sections of the map, also with explanations.The book divides the maps into five chronological categories. Below is a listing of these categories, each followed by three or four examples of maps in that category:CLASSICAL MAPS  1500BC-1300CEThe Babylonian World Map (the earliest known map) -- Dunhuang Star Chart (Li Chunfeng) -- The Book of Curiosities (Arabic/Islamic)DISCOVERY  AND TRADE 1300-1570Fra Mauro's World Map - -Map of Utopia (Holbein) - First Map of America (Waldseemullar)  --Mercator's Earth MapNEW DIRECTIONS AND BELIEFS 1570-1750Map of the Holy Land (Bar-Jacob) --  New Map of the World (Blaeu) -- Map of New England (Foster) --Brittania Atlas Road Map (Ogilby)THEMATIC MAPS  1750-1900Dr. Livingston's Map of Africa -- Map of All Under Heaven -- Indian Territory Map (Tanner)MODERN MAPPING 1900-PresentInternational Map of the World (Penck) -- London Underground Map (1933, Beck) -- Lunar Landings (NASA)- -  Equal Areas World Map (Peters)GREAT MAPS has a preface and introduction explaining the history of cartography worldwide. Brief text accompanies each map, describing its origin and providing guidance in regard to interpreting it  not an easy task. The ""Visual Tour"" close-ups of each map zero in on different sections  e.g. Peter street, The Isle of Devils, Paradise, The Great Wall, The Mountains of the Moon, Andalusia, the Heliocentric Solar System.In many of the earliest maps, small mythical pictures and scenes are portrayed across the map, indicating the overlap between the mapmakers' subjective and objective perceptions  how religious beliefs were intertwined with geographical awareness.  I also found myself captivated by the distortions and false impressions of the world throughout various time periods  e.g. the continent of North America without its West Coast. I wonder:  To what extent  in the future will we perceive the inaccuracies of our maps today of undersea or distant space?GREAT MAPS is gorgeous, with quality full-color printing and a dust jacket image a map, glittered in gold.  The book is a magnificent work of art as well as history. Also impressive is the immense amount of scholarship involved in decoding the maps  which contain text in a variety of languages (some archaic) and thousands of esoteric symbols.In conclusion, I will provide another glimpse of the material contained within this book by including my comments on some  of the maps that particularly intrigued me:THE CATALAN ATLAS OF 1375 includes both real and mythical lands, and doesn't distinguish one from the other.The CHINESE DUNHUANG STAR CHART not only portrays over 1300 stars, but links them to Chinese astrological symbols, and includes 26 cloud formations with their meanings.THE ARABIC BOOK OF CURIOSITIES significantly exaggerates the sizes of Spain, North Africa and Arabia.The 17th century SAWLEY WORLD MAP posits the Island of Delos as the center of the World, and also focuses upon  the Garden of Eden.The gorgeous Venetian WORLD MAP of Fra Mauro reveals the medieval Christian view of the world, from the perspective of Biblical geography.Juan de la Cosa's WORLD CHART of 1500 shows Columbus' landfall.The 1569 MERCATOR MAP is the first map to reveal a familiar looking North America.The 1648 Blaeu NEW MAP OF THE WORLD is remarkably precise in regard to Europe and Africa but omits the northwest U.S. and western Canada.Living near Boston, I was particularly intrigued by John Foster's highly distorted 1677 map of Massachusetts  the first map printed in the U.S.  Most towns around Boston are located in the completely wrong place  e.g. Concord east of Watertown, Springfield north of Marlborough.The KOREAN MAP OF ALL UNDER HEAVEN (1800) include some oddly named lands such as lands of the ""tangled strings"" and ""people without bowels"".The DIGITAL WORLD MAPPER CARTOGRAM created by Danny Dorling inflates or shrinks the size of countries in accordance with the variable being measured  e.g. population, poverty, transportation.In conclusion, GREAT MAPS is likely to be appreciated and treasured by anyone age 10 or older who is interested in maps, history , changing perceptions of the world, and magnificent visuals. It is a spectacular and substantial coffeetable book, and would be a excellent  birthday or Christmas gift for anyone with a love of learning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NKI85PEZL1B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465424636#wasThisHelpful","R1NKI85PEZL1B1","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given the opportunity to use and review this gloss shampoo, although I'm not the ideal candidate. My car is 16 years old, quite beat-up, and has survived many New England winters in an open parking lot, unprotected from the elements. I have no access to a hose for manual washing, and rely on several gallon-size water bottles, and sponges. Finally, due to a rotator cuff injury  affecting both arms, I have little arm power for vigorous cleaning. So this review pertains to the use of this gloss shampoo in the worst of circumstances.As some reviewers have noted, Einszett gloss shampoo is not very effective at cleaning a car of deep-seated grime. I did rinse my car first  filling and refilling gallon water bottles  before using  one capful of this concentrated, sudsy shampoo per gallon of water, and my toyota definitely does look better and even has a little shine. But the deep-seated grim remains. And there was some streaking, perhaps in part because I was unable to give the car a good hose-down.Because of the warnings about getting the shampoo in one's eyes or on one's skin (avoiding the latter is difficult  I used rubber gloves but still spattered a little), I was anxious the whole time I was cleaning about spattering the shampoo on my arms and legs, and afterwards gave my body a perhaps better cleaning than my car.I'd advise anyone with an old, weather-beaten, grime-saturated car who really want to improve their car's appearance to get it professionally cleaned first. Then this concentrated gloss shampoo may have greater effect. And if the car has lot of dings and scrapes, you may  to want gloss to call attention to them anyway. There are cheaper, more effective solutions for people in a similar situation as mine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPK3TLNLE9U7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TW8R4S#wasThisHelpful","RPK3TLNLE9U7I","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I am not a young adult, but rather, a senior citizen, I was drawn to read this young adult novel, which is actually a novel for adults as well. I teach photo-related courses,  and have color/verbal synaesthesia  in contrast to Giulia, this book's heroine, who has color/music synaesthesia.Actually though, I don't believe the author Victoria Strauss is very knowledgeable in regard to synaesthesia - which has to do with overlapping sensory areas in the brain, and does not suddenly occur during one's life. Plus, Strauss doesn't present with Giulia's synaesthesia with any depth or detail  it really isn't even essential to the novel, apart from its title.When Giulia gives up a sorcerer's charm at the beginning of the book, she begins to hear colors sing, especially the rare and costly ""passion blue"" color which has the purity and clarity of bells. But there is little discussion or development related to Giulia's synaesthesia. There is much more focus on the visual, especially the color of ""passion blue""  ""bluer than sapphires, bluer than oceans...with swirling azure currents and glinting sapphire radiance.""Synaesthesia issue aside, this is a highly absorbing, well-written historical novel about Giulia, an 18 year old girl with a passion for art who is forced into life in a convent against her will, in 15th century Padua, Italy. Fortunately, however, the convent is the only one of its kind that has an art studio for women. There, Giulia develops her talents in drawing and painting, and forms a close relationship with the maestra, who is also the inventor of a recipe for a rare and expensive form of blue paint  passion blue. When her beloved Maestra dies and bequeaths the secret recipe to Giulia at the beginning of the novel, the jealous new Maestra Domenica  restricts Giulia's ability to paint because she won't hand over the valuable recipe.In this world of limited options and little safety for females, Giulia escapes the convent, dresses as a boy, travels to Venice, and attempts to become the apprentice of a master painter, Maestro Ferraldi.  Here, Giulia struggles with trying to maintain her disguise, knowing that she will be kicked out and perhaps forced to return to the convent if she is discovered  or if she is found by her enemies who seek the rare passion blue recipe. But she has friends as well, particularly the courtesan Sophia and her 19 year old son, Bernardo, who does not know that she is a girl.Author Strauss is adept at enabling us to experience Giulia's fears and passion for art, as well as her life in Venice. Clearly, Strauss has researched the Venice of the early Renaissance, as well as the plight of women and the details of artists' workshops, including the making of paint. She skillfully integrates historical details into the novel, which moves at just the right pace, with just enough twists and turns to hold interest. Although I could foresee one development that would occur by the end, another was a complete surprise.I had not read Passion Blue, the precursor of this novel, and wished I had, but since author explains the key happenings in the first novel that are relevant to Giulia's current situation, it wasn't necessary to have read the preceding book. However, if readers have the choice, they might enjoy Color Song even more if they begin with Passion Blue.Color Song is likely to appeal to young adults and adults who love historical novels, coming of age stories, Renaissance Italy, and the world of art.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQN0ZF9QJ0B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477825045#wasThisHelpful","R2IQN0ZF9QJ0B9","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The place is Germany, not the Germany we know today, but rather the Holy Roman Empire. The time period is the mid 1400s, the transitional time between the Middle Ages and Renaissance - a time of plague, dictatorial Church power, hints of future rebellion against Rome (particularly in Northern Europe), the fall of Constantinople, and the aborted beginning of the Crusades.GUTENBERG'S APPRENTICE focuses upon the scribe Peter Schoeffer, and the years during which he worked day and night, contributing to the printing of the first Bible at least as much as Johann Gutenberg did. The novel presents in detail the obstacles faced by Schoeffer - particularly the difficult of devising the first means of printing and the process of printing a 1200 page Bible.It also reveals the struggle to keep the entire venture secret, including paying off many guilds of craftsmen who were contributing necessary supplies. If the Church found out about the printing press, the men involved might be convicted as heretics. But even more likely, the Church would take over the press, and use it for corrupt purposes - the mass printing of indulgences, the Church's practice of selling its blessings in order to acquire greater wealth.""When you get to my age, Peter,"" Gutenberg told Schoeffer in regard to his invention, ""you do begin to wonder if it really is a gift from God - and not a curse sent up from hell.""Peter Schoeffer himself, as portrayed by Christie, was a scribe who was initially appalled by the idea of a mechanical means of printing God's word. But soon, he became convinced of the sacredness of the task and the significance of making the Bible available to thousands of people, not just the clergy and the wealthiest of the wealthy.Until the invention of the printing press, every Bible was hand-copied by scribes, and was sold for more than a years' wages of the average worker. The educated were a minority, but few of them had access to a  Bible. They had to rely on readings by priests, who used their near-monopoly over religious texts as a means of cementing control. The development of printing was a turning point in history, and contributed greatly to the flowering of the Renaissance.I loved this book, and found the historical detail fascinating. I highly recommend it. But I also recognize that readers who aren't spiritually inclined or not in continual awe of the power of the written word, might not find the novel as absorbing as I did. It is not fast-paced, and although Alix Christie is skilled in narrating the early days of the printing press, she does not excel in character development.But the main character, Peter, is real enough, as is the half-mad, temperamental and unpredictable Gutenberg. After all, GUTENBERG'S APPRENTICE is not meant to be a character-driven novel, but rather an in-depth research-based although fictionalized narrative.What for me is most lacking is resource material - illustrations of the different components of the early printing press, and an encyclopedic text-based summary of the stages of the printing process with descriptions of each component. At the very least, the author could have pointed readers to relevant online resources, particularly visual resources.But even without such supplementary material, GUTENBERG'S APPRENTICE thoroughly and effectively allows us to experience the earliest days of printing, and the key characters who made possible the mass proliferation of books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33U63L8DIF4Q9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062336010#wasThisHelpful","R33U63L8DIF4Q9","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"E-CUBED  is a ""new age"" book, reflecting the same ""You create your own reality"" view as the book, THE SECRET.  Author  Pam Grout presents principles from what she calls the outdated worldview #1, and the alternative, more life-affirming principles of worldview #2. She also presents nine behavioral experiments to test the validity of those principles.I take issue with many of them, but also strongly believe in the validity of others. In this review, I will first express my skepticism in regard to some of her assumptions (explaining my reasons), before noting the facets of her book which I believe have value and for some readers, are worth reading.Some of the principles she presents are: ""There is nothing to fear,"" "" Everybody gets a happy ending,""  ""There is no reason to struggle,"" ""Life emanates from me,""  ""The only thing I have to do is follow my joy,"" and ""Money isn't real"".When I was in my 20s and 30s, beginning in the late 1960s, I would have agreed with most of Pam Grout's assumptions. At that time I was beginning to lead ""new age"" workshops, and to write books which professed a ""new age"" philosophy. I also attempted to live by that philosophy, attracting some wonderful, synchronistic experiences and also near-catastrophes. Now I am aware of how naive and ungrounded I was - not preparing  for the worst or taking necessary precautions to ensure my future wellbeing.The corollary of ""You create your own reality"" is the belief that you choose the reality you experience and if what you intend and envision does not manifest, then you are failing to believe deeply enough or to apply the principles effectively.Bull. I do not believe that my professional pianist aunt chose to have seven fingers cut off in a car accident caused by a drunken driver the week before her first international concert tour, which she wanted more than anything. I do not believe that my mother who had had after-death experiences, had deep faith in the next world and carried her living will around in her wallet, chose to be kept alive on half a machine for six months by doctors who ignored her living will - the hospital collected her $6 million worth of supplemental insurance and let her die when her insurance ran out. I do not believe that despite years of affirmations and healing practices, that I chose to suffer from a chronic illness for forty years.Men don't usually choose to be killed in war; women don't choose to be raped. Bad things happen to good people, often through new fault of their own.  And spending hours a day praying and envisioning your life dream is no guarantee that it will manifest. (But it certainly is likely to increase the odds of your being able to manifest it, provided you do more than just envision it.)Pam Grout's ""worldview 2"" is based upon unlimited abundance, wish fulfillment, blind optimism and goodness in contrast to a bleak ""worldview 1"" which assumes a hostile dog-eat-dog universe of constant struggle, where work is a necessary evil. Personally, I don't buy either view.  There is a middle way between blind optimism and unrelenting pessimism. It's called realism.Within the worldview of realism, we have some ability to manifest or attract what we seek, and our beliefs and thoughts do influence reality. But limitation is real, obstacles (internal and external) are real, and (on the earth plane), money is real as well --- and  if you act as if it isn't, you'll create a lot of difficulties for yourself. I've known several ""new age"" people who operated on the principle of an abundant universe that they could trust to fund their life purpose. Both went bankrupt and lost their homes. The first also lost his marriage. The second committed suicide. There is no substitute for grounding in physical reality.So far I've presented some principles discussed by Pam Grout and my reasons for being skeptical - and encouraging you to be skeptical - in regard to some of them. As a deeply spiritual person, I on the other hand affirm other principles that she presents.. Some of them are: """"There is an invisible energy force field of infinite possibilities,"" ""You impact that field,"" ""Whatever you focus on expands,"" ""Your thoughts and consciousness impact matter"" (Note:  ""impact""  not ""create""), ""You are connected to everyone and everything in the universe,""  ""My worthiness is not at stake,"" and ""God is  state of being, a loving energy that flows through me.""There are a few life-expanding personal experiments in this book. There are also many gems of wisdom. For example: ""If we want to create more energy and therefore more 'bandwidth' for a joyful life, we must being to pay attention to things that matter. And let go of all the things that don't.""In short, E-CUBED is a mixed bag. If you read it, I suggest maintaining a healthy skepticism but also a healthy openness. You don't have to agree with it all or debunk it all, although you may be tempted to take one stand or the other. Life is neither  black and white, nor either/or. There is a middle way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WUS2IMOOHQL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401945430#wasThisHelpful","R2WUS2IMOOHQL2","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was in the middle of a non-stop sneezing allergy attack when I heard a thump at my front door, and opened it to discover that my giant package of Puffs softpack tissue had arrived. Of course, I was quick to open and use them.One reason why I like these packs that few people note is that the opening at top is not a cutout area that leaves the top tissue partly exposed to the dust particles in the air. The top tissue can be pushed back into the softpack so that the pack is almost sealed closed. This is a great advantage for anyone allergic to dust. Tissues are of little use when the top one only exacerbates nose-blowing because of invisible dust particles it has attracted. Also, the allergy prone might be happy to know that the tissues have no noticeable scent.The most lauded characteristic of the softpacks appears to be the softpacks themselves  that they are lighter, smaller and above all more collapsible than regular kleenex boxes. Sure, this is a plus, but I don't find it to be as big a deal as the advertising suggests. The space-saving is really quite minimal. Nevertheless, it certainly can be an advantage in many circumstances.Some people dislike the different color combinations of the soft plastic packaging  mostly a pale turquoise/silver streamer design, gold/white polka dots, or yellow/silver swirls. I don't mind, but if you keep your softpacks out in the open and want them to match the color of your decor, you have little choice here. However, if color matters to you, you are probably best off  purchasing color-coordinated boxes in which to place your tissue packages.The tissues themselves are slightly larger than regular box size tissues, and certainly stronger. I did a strength test on both dry and wet tissues, and indeed Puffs were more difficult to rip in both circumstances than either the regular box tissues or the small purse packets that I had on hand. But are they 50% stronger? Of that, I'm not sure.If some of the benefits of Puffs that I mentioned appeal to you, then by all means, purchase them. I find them superior to kleenex tissues that I used in the past, and recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D02CP1WSM9S6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5J9II0#wasThisHelpful","R2D02CP1WSM9S6","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FLIP-IT! comes with six 38mm purple base caps with attached stands (so the bottle can stand upside down), several sheets of different sized punch-out  gaskets for inserting in the cap or adapter, and two each of three sizes of adapters for 33mm (red), 28mm (orange) and 24 mm bottle necks or large tubes.I am not very handy and was afraid that I wouldn't be able to figure out how to use FLIP-IT, but the instructions are clear. What confused me initially is that the adapters and gaskets all looked the same size. But the included list of items noting the color/size combinations helps differentiate them, and when I tried them I did see the difference. It did seem, however ,to be a hassle to have to try different combinations in order to find the right ones to use  - and so many parts means more dishwashing to do.I only regularly use three kinds of bottles or tubes containing thick fluids. The large cap did work in minutes for my giant Heinz ketchup bottles. Since what has most concerned me is all the expensive John Frieda conditioner and shampoo I lose from  their large thick tubes, I was pleased to discover that the FLIP-IT! caps (with middle size adapter and gasket) work on these. I had hoped FLIP-IT! would work on toothpaste tubes, but not so.One problem for me is that the flipped bottles and tubes upside down on the cap + base must be stored on a solid surface. This is not convenient for me. I live in a tiny apartment with almost no counter space and a small refrigerator. The large extended size of the upside down caps means that large ketchup bottles can only tightly fit in the refrigerator door, and take up extra space. In the bathroom, the upside down shampoos and conditioners can't be stored on open metal racks nor will they fit in the medicine cabinet, so the only alternative is the limited floor space, which means they can be easily kicked over in a tiny bathroom.Finally, given that I finish about one bottle a week, my estimate is that using FLIP-IT! will save me about 25 cents per week or about $1 a month. It will therefore take 20 months to pay off the $20 cost. For me, it is not worth it. But for a single person who uses twice the number of thick fluids as I do, or for a larger household, it may be worth the cost and the time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB73GJX0E9VX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LNJKX7W#wasThisHelpful","RB73GJX0E9VX7","A3ITL5EYKTZTF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ITL5EYKTZTF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow. Just woe. I have loved the myth of Hades and Persephone for as long as I remember, and this book does not disappoint the very least! The author remains faithful to her source material, while at the same time adding several fantastically creative twists to the myths. I found her version of the Sisyphus myth to be especially brilliant.Normally, I'm not a fan of the version of the Persephone myth which has her being promised to Hades by Zeus (or Poseidon, in the couple of versions where Poseidon is her father instead of Zeus) at birth. It's never felt right for me for babies to be promised in marriage, however, Ms. Alexander pulls this off with surprising tact, and there is a very good story behind this promise, which makes the story work so well.And what about the Hades/Persephone dynamics? Very well-executed here, as well. The entire book has been thought out well, and she put in some fascinating details/aspects about the Underworld that made it feel much more real. Her research, and twists, are spot-on.And the erotic scenes between our dynamic duo... mmm. Definitely swoon-worthy. I've read too many erotica scenes with cheesy descriptions and metaphors, but Ms. Alexander writes such scenes in such a steamy yet tasteful way that leaves the reader wishing that they were Persephone (or Hades) Nom nom nom.I await with bated breath for the sequel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6XHP7M6GAHOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HGMDT8#wasThisHelpful","R6XHP7M6GAHOZ","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well. What a huge letdown. Not that I should expect much else from Andrew Neiderman trying to masquerade as V.C. Andrews, but the premise of this novel did actually sound promising, and anything, just about ANYTHING had to be better than the Christoper's Diary books!However, I found the character of Mayfair Cummings to be unlikable. Like, seriously. She has a brilliant IQ, and naturally people with higher IQs may feel frustrated with people not as smart as them, but Mayfair is so condescending sometimes that any pity you might feel for her (like having a stepmother like Julie) is wiped away once she deliberately baits someone or tries to make them feel stupid. Even her stepsister, who she gets along better with, is still condescended down to.For a premise that sounded so promising, Neiderman ruined it with his lackluster, rushed writing... as he always does. This book does not measure up to VCA standards, but it doesn't measure up to ANY good standard, period. I'm serious - I've read LOTS of self-published books that are of far better caliber than this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NF1DN8WZPY7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451650906#wasThisHelpful","R3NF1DN8WZPY7Y","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty easy book to read and was a fairly quick one for me. I was a bit confused with the timeline, there is this family tree at the beginning of the book. Sam's birthdate is given as 1958, while Callie is 1960. However, reading the book and doing the math (Callie was pregnant at 27) would put her birthdate as 1969. There's also the fact that it has been mentioned there is a decent age difference between them.One other thing I didn't get was Callie's father's treatment towards his daughter. He cut ties with her because she slept with her brother... only the man in question was not related to her in any actual way, he was just her stepbrother (who was 10 years her senior, and never actually lived with her) so I found Dad's attitude a rather contrived plot point especially given he did a 180 at the end of the book.

What a letdown...The story started off really well. it was interesting reading about a character with such a genetic issue like Chris, and how it has affected his life in such a way. I would have liked to read more about that. As the bigger picture was revealed, it became more incoherent. The monkeys, for example, and the story about them... I found the story just too implausible. Mr. Koontz has a good writing style, but this story was a major letdown, and extremely cliched and cheesy in some ways, especially the scene where Chris goes to visit his friend on the boat and there's the whole conversation the friend had with/about the dog and cat and all that.Definitely not one of Mr. Koontz' best work, I recommend Darkfall or Lightning instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R59L59NE527F9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345533305#wasThisHelpful","R59L59NE527F9","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have mixed feelings about this book. Aside the whole fact that this book was released after the end of the Fables series despite the events in this volume happening before the end, there are two major issues with this book. Now, mind you, I enjoyed the story of glamour and the animals wanting glamour, but wasn't this series meant to focus on the women of Fables and explore their backgrounds?The first book revolved around Sleeping Beauty and to a lesser extent the Snow Queen, and was the best in the series. Volume 2 was about Rapunzel and left more questions than answers and now with the end, it looks like we will never find out about Rapunzel's babies. Vol 3 was about Prince Charming! Vol 4 was about Cinderella but we don't learn anything about her past other than a couple of details which just left us wanting more (like about her stepsister. That was never explained!)And so here we are with volume 5, which had a nice story about the animals, and a issue about Goldlilocks, but this issue doesn't ever explore her past and how she came to her beliefs.The second major issue is the story revolving around Renard the Fox. I felt that his romance was slapdash and sloppy, and just a way to tie up something (that didn't even need to be tied in the first place)So I am giving three stars for the good things, including the sidestory about Owl and Pussycat, but deducting two stars for the issues I mentioned above.

"After reading 'Where the Wind Blows'. I was happy to have snagged this book from my local Little Free Library. It is definitely one of Patterson's better works (that I have read) and I can't for the life of me understand why Patterson abandoned the original version of Max/the other bird children for the crappy reboot Maximum Ride. Wind Blows/Lake House is leagues ahead in storytelling than the Maximum Ride series, and Lake House left an ending with plenty of unanswered questions that could have led into a third book for the original bird children series. When I read 'Where the Wind Blows' (having read the first Maximum Ride book) I was stunned at how poor Maximum Ride was compared to Wind Blows, and even more so after reading Lake House, Patterson is a meh author but Wind Blows/Lake House was actually a decent series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROA6GH1X9TJDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316711136#wasThisHelpful","ROA6GH1X9TJDA","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am not part of the target audience for this book. Nonetheless, I found the information in here to be very handy and useful. While written for people in business, many of the 28 skills listed here can also apply to family (whether singly, immediate family units, or even extended family) and the same goes for friends.Honestly, some of the advice in here is common sense and can be applied to non-business situations, though others are very business-specific. Some of the things in here can also apply to low-tier workers, but others are more geared towards people in middle or upper management.The talk about Hidden Strengths and how to develop them, as well as taking a bandage approach to Weaknesses, made me think of my own skills, and which ones I can better develop, and which ones I ultimately have always sucked at. Fortunately my job doesn't require any of the skills I am weak in, but a couple of things in here have made me think.

"As someone with no knowledge of Arabic, or personal experience with Islam, I read this book with a open mind. I found it very handy in learning some parts of the Quran.There is plenty of scripture in here preaching peace - to invite people to study Islam instead of converting them by force, being kind to women and orphans, that girl children are as important as boys, cold-blooded murder is wrong, and so on. Mr. Rehman shows genuine sorrow at how people use the religion to commit violence (just as kind Christians lament the Bible being used as an excuse for violence)However, I had two issues with this book. First is that for all his lecturing against drunkenness, gambling, and fornication/prostitution (especially when he talks about Islamic countries today) he never once mentions female genital mutilation, which some Muslims practice to ""guard the chastity"" of their women. I was genuinely surprised that he made no mention of that.My second issue is that he goes on and on about the sins of Islamic countries - how their kings/leaders lead lavish lives while the people live in poverty, and so on. I mean yes, it's true, but in pretty much every country he discusses, he always says 'the ruling class lives in riches, the people live in poverty, there's gambling, drinking, prostitution' in one form or another and it got repetitive.The Quran does have passages in it about infidels and how they need to be destroyed, but I am glad that the author chose to focus on scripture that encouraged positive behavior. In the end, the Bible is not much different from the Quran in that both books both have passages that promote peace, yet other parts promote violence.The author also goes into the history (briefly) of each of the countries he discusses, and he also discusses the history of the Prophet Mohammed and the beginning of Islam. So, I think this is a good book if you want to learn more about the positive aspects of the Quran, but it does not present a complete picture of Islam.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22OICMV9V6AEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990928411#wasThisHelpful","R22OICMV9V6AEL","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"WTF. Seriously, WTF.I read the original trilogy in my teens (yeah, yeah, I admit I was curious, and I'd already read her vampire novels) and though the writing style was good, I was repulsed by the fact that all these princes and princesses had been forced into slavery, sent there by their own parents, no less!So when I heard there was a fourth book coming out, I was intrigued but wary. When I heard that Beauty makes it so that slavery is consensual, I was relieved. However, there were plenty of negative reviews, so I went over to Amazon and read the free preview.No wonder this book has been received so negatively. Not only does Rice's prose feel significantly different (in a worse way), but the narrative itself was BORING. I plodded through it, not giving a spit about any of the characters narrating.There are also a couple of things that contradict from previous novels. In the first book, it is clearly stated that the tradition of sexual slavery has gone on for at least a century, as Beauty's parents had been slaves in the court of the Queen's grandfather. But in this book, apparently the Queen started the practice, to copy her Sultan friend?I don't even. Granted, it's been a long while since Rice penned the original trilogy, but what I read of this book was so awful and boring, that after reading the free preview, I had NO interest in purchasing the rest of it, especially given that the Kindle price is ridiculous.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BEC18ZQKJF84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525427996#wasThisHelpful","R1BEC18ZQKJF84","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really torn with what rating to give this book. Let me start off by saying that the author's writing style and prose is cleat and crisp, and I think she has a lot of potential. I found the writing itself easy (by this I mean clear, not dumbed down) to read. I would definitely be willing to read more by this author.The reason I rated this book as such was that the story didn't make sense to me. The pitch was intriguing to me, and I thought it would focus more on Mary helping Linda to adapt to the modern day life. There was nothing of that. There is no explanation as to how Linda was pulled out of prehistoric times and ended up on Mary's fire escape, and there is pretty much nothing of Linda's reactions to modern living. She just passively accepts anything Mary does.There were just too many storylines, none of them truly explored. I wish the author could have focused on ONE story thread and went with it. Mary's past/childhood would have made a compelling novel into itself, from what snippets of it I saw in this book.Or the author could have focused on Linda learning to adapt to her new life. Really, after Mary takes her in, nothing more is said/made of of Linda's difference from others. The novel could have been about Linda learning from her new life, and Mary and others learning from Linda, but nothing of that sort happens here, Linda is simply taught to cook and clean and that's about it.The ending made no sense to me, and I was rather disappointed in it. I was left feeling rather unfulfilled. Again, the author has good prose/writing style, but the story itself just wasn't solid.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5VQDE7WRHQV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502390507#wasThisHelpful","R5VQDE7WRHQV7","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoyed this book - I love historical fiction. This book is somewhat reminiscent of Clan of the Cave Bear. However, I don't understand how a woman of the main female's complexion (light brown hair and green eyes) would have been in North America 10,000 years ago. I suppose the author did it to make her special/more noticeable (Mamut dwells on her unique hair color and eyes more than once) but the story would have worked just as well if the woman had the usual Native American complexion that everyone else did.The lovemaking scenes were actually well-written and not too graphic. I'm just glad that she didn't go the Cassie Edwards route. The story was overall good and realistic.So why two stars?

Yes, there are a couple of cliches here and there, but I found the story itself to be engaging and believable (if a bit out there, but this book was written as a thriller) The story itself was well-paced, and as usual. the author displays his medical knowledge so he knows what he is writing about.However, I could only give this book 3 stars because of the ending. The main character, Dr. Blumenthal, is treated unfairly by a superior of hers after she rejects his advances. He continues to be a jerk after this, to the point of actual unprofessionalism. However, at the end of the book, Marissa still finds him attractive (at least, physically) and still wants to go out with him, regretting the fact that she had rebuffed him.This really bothered me as his attitude towards her was completely repugnant and unprofessional, so I had to drop one star from the overall rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R9GY9D4C76GL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042510687X#wasThisHelpful","R1R9GY9D4C76GL","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is FULL of delusion, as well as faulty research, and was clearly written with a biased/skewed view of the Fat Acceptance Movement and its encouragement of ignoring/denying the damaging effects that obesity has on the body.Ragen Chastain has proven herself to cherry-pick research, and to lean heavily on faulty research - in essence, using anything to try to prove herself right, regardless of how wrong, or how cherry-picked the ""source"" is, and contributors to this book are as like-minded as she is, apparently. There are several names in this that I immediately recognized, like Cat Pause and Josephine Cranberry.Some examples.""Eighty to 90% of any person's weight is caused by genetics"" - Daufin, chapter 16)WROMG. This is an excellent example of cherry-picking/skewing information. The correct fact is that 80-90 percent of someone's weight DISTRIBUTION is caused by genetics - this is where some people are more apple-shaped, others pear-shaped, and so on. Calories/weight don't magically appear from nowhere, as many people in the FA movement want to believe.There is also talk of celebrating one's body in here. I'm all for body acceptance and being ok with not looking like a Victoria's Secret Model, but having seen, in real life, obese people struggling with mobility - getting up from a seat or walking around - because of the excess fat on their bodies, I don't see any reason to celebrate obesity.Cathy Miller (chapter 2) points out how much is spent on beauty (cosmetics) and the weight-loss industry. However, what she neglects to mention is how much is spent by the fast-food industry to market their products, and how much profit they make from said products - which is much more than is spent on cosmetics and weight loss products combined! This is a fine example of skewed data.She also complains about the fashion industry and how harder it is to find nice clothing when you're obese. She conveniently neglects to mention that the fatter a body gets, the more difficult it is to design clothing that will fit everyone within a certain weight range. Fat is distributed differently along the body due to genetics, and this is something that the fashion industry has difficulty accommodating. It is easy to design a garment that can fit most if not all women who weight between say, 140-160 pounds, but not so easy when the weight range is 300-400 pounds. This is not the fashion industry's fault (though FA/HAES proponents will claim otherwise) When you move into the range of X (2X, 3X, 4X, and so on, considerably more material is required, yet I've also seen many FA supporters complain about how they have to pay more for said clothing. Pfft.The next chapter is from Josephine Cranberry (chapter 3) who at the end of her life, weighed 350 pounds, and said that she constantly dieted in her youth to attain an ideal weight. She complained about how diets constantly failed her. What she obviously didn't understand (or refused to understand) was that to maintain a healthy weight requires a lifestyle commitment to a healthy diet, not a quick fix.I've only touched upon 3 chapters of this book, but found PLENTY wrong with it.Unfortunately, it is this kind of flaw3ed ""logic"" which feeds FA/HAES, and which do its proponents much more harm than good. Having struggled with weight myself in the past, I know exactly who to blame - myself. It is my choices regarding what I eat, and how much I exercise, that cause me to gain or lose weight, not the illusive, catch-all excuse of ""genetics"".Fortunately, this book is not self-published, and Ragen is an editor, this book was made for a university. So there is a disclaimer at the beginning of this book that says it is not intended to substitute the advice of a medical professional, and so on. Thank goodness for small favors, because if this book was entirely under Ragen's control, you can bet this disclaimer would not be there!Also - what is the deal with the price for this book?

Would highly recommend to any Dracula/vampire enthusiasts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10R70OHIBGJRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OALBUZY#wasThisHelpful","R10R70OHIBGJRG","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good visuals and a interesting storyline make this movie worth watching. I haven't read the book so I can't say if the movie is faithful to the feel of the book or not, but I found the film accessible and had a good grasp of what was going on. The ending was very weird, and I must admit, was a letdown. I will admit I spoilered myself on the series after watching this movie, and though the movie was very good, I am not sure I want to watch the next movies when they come out since it seems like the author suffers from third-book suckiness (see Mockingjay, Allegiant)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A6Z32O9LFKWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OY7YPGK#wasThisHelpful","R2A6Z32O9LFKWI","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This movie had some great parts, and was overall a good movie, set in yet another museum, so we got to meet new characters and all that. However, I felt that Rebel Wilson was very ill-placed in this movie. Her character really contributed nothing to the film, and I found her stupid and useless. I'm not sure why she was put in here. It is also never explained why Akhmurrah was so favored over his older brother Khanmurrah (from the second movie) The origins of the tablet are revealed, and I certainly could see why Khanmurrah would be so jealous of his younger brother, I wish that the Pharaoh and his wife had explained this, at least.

"I really enjoyed this book. I've read several CYOA books as a kid, but these were geared for kids. This is the first adult CYOA book I've read, so it was a unique experience for me.I took my time to read this book and go through the various possible endings. I'll admit I did this by bookmarking pages where I had a choice, so that I could backtrack, but I really wanted to read this book in its entirety, and I am glad I did.The choices you make for your character can really affect his life. There is some religion/philosophy in here, which I found really interesting as I read it, since in one storyline, he debates religion with his girlfriend, in another he debates philosophy, and so on.The endings are rather varied. Some are really weird, like when your character goes into this garden maze with an apple in it. Others are ""quiet""/ordinary. Some endings are abrupt, and some sad. There's also one ending that's really... unique. I won't spoil it, though.

I love historical fiction, so this seemed like a good choice.I found myself unable to connect with anyone in the story. The story happens more in the present than the past, and several things just didn't make sense to me. I really would have preferred for the story to focus more on the main character and his love, instead of the relationship between him and his adopted daughter - Sunny just comes across as an spoiled brat and ungrateful for what she has been given in life.The story of Hata and the comfort woman was far too brief, with an ending that just disappointed me (because of how brief it was, not specifically what happened to the woman, though I wish that could have been different, too) This story would have been far, far better if the entire story had happened during WWII, instead of afterward, and that story had been more fleshed out as well.

It's this kind of rawness which makes the story more real, as he doesn't hesitate to use bad language (although it's not at all excessive) and some parts of the story are pretty depressing, which the author again illustrates with his style of writing.

"This is a really fun book for kids. The story is told from the first-person POV of the main character, Orion Spence, who is 10 years old. The voice that narrates this book matches that of a 10-year old as well, making this book easily accessible to such an audience. I found some parts of this book to be quite clever, like the notion of Donkey Island (certainly wouldn't mind having that in real life) or a house that looked like a pinecone.I have to admit, I'm rather partial to pumpkin pie and orange cats, so seeing them being so treasured on Patalosh was a real treat for me, although that's not what made this book so overall enjoyable. (There's even a recipe for pumpkin pie in here. Yum!)This book is a combination of sci fi and fantasy, though both are brought to an level that is appropriate for 10-year olds. There is also some historical trivia thrown in here, though again, at an age-appropriate level, so it's easily accessible to kids and manages to be interesting without being overwhelming. I also liked the illustrations in here, particularly for Sir K as he was such a main character in the story that having that illustration definitely helped since he is not quite human.The spells in here are relatively easy to understand, and come in various colors and are referred to as such - pink spell, brown spell, and so on, instead of being Latin-inspired like you would find in Harry Potter, or needing complex incantations like you'd find in other fantasy novels. Within the story, there is a list of the colors and spells they correspond to, so you understand the magic that is being used.Some of the things in here may come across as cheesy, like for example, Daagerd's castle is called 'The Ice Castle of Fire'. Whether this was intentional or not, I still found it cheesy yet amusing.There is quite the twist near the ending, and I was genuinely surprised by it. I won't say what it is, but I definitely hope that it is explored more in a later story, as it revolves around Daaggerd. The ending of this book hints at more, and should the author write a sequel, I would be happy to read it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35W842Z0FMDD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S35UJDM#wasThisHelpful","R35W842Z0FMDD7","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In some ways, it reminded me of Harry Potter, likely because each chapter had a little illustration at the beginning of it like you would find in the Harry Potter books, but I can assure you, this book is not a rip-off.The author made the story work well because the main character, Anni, isn't a special child like Harry Potter is. She is an ordinary girl, and it is her friend who is special (though Anni doesn't know it at first)Anni's frustration at things being kept secret from her, especially after being exposed to magic, is realistic, because I would feel the same way if I was in her situation.

"The sheer wtfery of this book is just so stupefying that I can barely comprehend it. Marvelous measles? There's nothing marvelous about a disease that not only can kill people through its course, but leaves survivors with all kinds of potential lifelong damage. That's why vaccines exist - so that people don't have to die or suffer from horrible diseases like measles or polio.The story in this book is just bonkers. Sheer bonkers. Melanie has measles but things are going to be awwright because she eats fruits and vegetables. Yeah, I know a healthy diet is good for you, but if a healthy diet was all that was needed to prevent disease, then we'd have an instant cure/preventative for all these horrible diseases.Also, this book conveys the message that even if you're vaccinated, you'll still get sick, as there is one boy (Melanie's friend) who was vaccinated, but still got measles, and suffered terribly from it while Melanie bounced back from her own measles.I know that the immune system needs a workout now and then to keep it in good order, but that's for smaller things, like a common cold or flu (although complications still can arise from these) not for more serious things like measles. I'd rather deal with the low fever and achy arm I got from my tetanus vax, then the actual full-on lockjaw itself.This book really is good for nothing more than lulz and showing the ignorance of anti-vaxxers.Also... why on earth did this author decide to rip off the title of s Roald Dahl book? I'm also curious as to why the girl on the cover of this book is dressed in such terrible clothing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YCOWHWCZ5FM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APUNP7U#wasThisHelpful","R1YCOWHWCZ5FM8","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was really... meh for me. I try to judge books as fairly as I can, given the time periods they were written in. This one was written in the late sixties, so I certainly didn't expect it to be the same as current Harlequin romances, but nonetheless, it fell flat for me.For those of you wondering if this has anything to do with the myth of Hades and Persephone, no, it doesn't. Most of the book is set in Greece, and the myth is briefly mentioned, but the storyline of the novel doesn't have anything to do with the myth.Oddly, the character I liked best was Stacey's father in law, even though he was a manipulative man. To me, he felt like the most real character in the book, despite his intentions.There is no actual lovemaking scene in this book, although it is implied at one point. I only say this because Harlequin books can be known for their steamy scenes, so if you're looking for that, you won't find it here. Overall it's a very bland book, and not one I could really recommend.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OPAQL8DY2TUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001D6VYPA#wasThisHelpful","R1OPAQL8DY2TUR","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this to be a nicely-written book, with a very realistic bent on the subject matter. Some of the books I've read regarding teens with superpowers tend to be more fantastic (i.e. Firestarter, X-Men, and so on) and while these stories are fun to read, this one presented the subject in a more realistic way. I was impressed with how the author made this seem actually possible, with the mechanics of how the heat-power works.He also did a really nice job expressing the thoughts of the characters and their stream of consciousness. Each of the characters has a distinct voice, which is great as I've read other books where all the characters sound/feel the same.I didn't expect the ending to be the way it was (not saying what it is, read for yourself :) ) and its nice to be surprised like that.

"I have mixed feelings about this book. There were some parts I really enjoyed, but in some places the perspectives jumped back and forth so much. There was one chapter from the POV of the Duce himself, even. Not that there was anything necessarily wrong with that, but the story felt disjointed sometimes.I really liked the characters of Pelagia and her father. I thought that they were realistically-written, and Corelli and Carlo as well. Even Madras was written well at first, though his character deteriorated as the book went along because his story became so disjointed.I couldn't help but feel disappointed at the ending. I felt that Corelli's actions were unjustified, if he hadn't been so stupid, then he could have saved Pelagia and himself a lot of sorrow.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JQGO5BR9RF4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EPZ6DS#wasThisHelpful","R1JQGO5BR9RF4L","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow. I was really impressed with this book. I always enjoy when authors take old mythologies/folklore and bring them to life. I will admit I was a bit iffy with this one, since I read (and immensely disliked) the Secret Magdalene. However, this book did not disappoint me at all, and brought the character of Dinah to reality.I've heard the story of Dinah before, and it was always cast into such a negative light, but when I read the actual Bible scripture, it seemed very ambiguous on whether Dinah was actually taken against her will or not - it seemed more that her brothers and father were angry about the fact that their sister had a lover (if she did indeed choose him on her own and laid with him with her consent) without their approval, since women back then were seen as chattel and so on.That is what this book does - Dinah actually enjoys and cares for her lover, and she wants more control over her own fate, something which her father and brothers don't like as they're more of the 'my daughter/wife/woman, my rules' instead of letting women have a say in major decisions in their lives.This book is also very well-written, with beautiful imagery and it's easy to imagine how women lived in this era. Overall a very wonderful book which brings to vivid life an ambiguous Bible story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPKFMW3ZHFF1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312427298#wasThisHelpful","RPKFMW3ZHFF1W","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not often that I read novels set in/during war, and most of them are during more well-known wars, such as WWII. I really enjoyed this book, and the stories of the two main characters. I really liked Jasmine's story, it explained well how she came to where she was, and her relationship with the man who would eventually save her life.My only complaint is that while the author gave Jasmine a fleshed out background, she failed to do so for Jasmine's lover. Therefore, while I could easily imagine Jasmine and her motivations, how she looked, and so on, I found it harder to do for the other main character. His love story with Jasmine is well-written, but it was harder to see him as a real person because we aren't given a backstory that was as fleshed out as Jasmine's (it seems the book was more about Jasmine instead of being more equal) Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the book, and I would read more from this author if she was to write more books.She did a really nice job of describing conditions during the war and how hard it would have been for people, regardless of who/where they are (war-torn fields of Korea, the Communist upheaval in China, etc) and the ending of this story brought tears to my eyes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8MKB0GIY4E97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FW0JIRE#wasThisHelpful","R8MKB0GIY4E97","A370Z6I5GBWU44","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A370Z6I5GBWU44?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a surprising and fascinating book, less for its contents than for the style and backstory.  The author was William Joyce, born in America, migrated to Ireland, British in his twenties, and servant of the Reich from 1939 and thereafter. Joyce was the infamous ""Lord Haw Haw,"" who broadcast English language propaganda for the Nazis during World War II.  He was captured by the allies in 1945 and hanged as a traitor in 1946; although technically he was an Irish citizen and not a British traitor, in spirit, since he had integrated himself de facto into English politics and life during the 1920s and 1930s, he was very much the traitor.I found two things surprising. The first was the relative youth of Joyce.  I had assumed that Lord Haw Haw was an older, sedentary intellectual, but in fact he was a youthful fascist streetfighter.  He was born in 1906 and became immersed in British fascist politics, specifically the British Union of Fascists, in the 1920s.  He split from the BUF and formed his own splinter fascist group in the 1930s.  He apparently was quite the orator, and if this text reflects his actual rhetorical gifts, then he certainly would have been formidable.That leads to the second surprise, namely the fact that Joyce seems to be a well-educated man.  Again, I had a stereotype of the Fascist as an inarticulate brute, able only to hurl anti-semitic insults.  Furthermore, my stereotype of the BUF was that it was a silly, stupid affair. However, when you read this book, you get the sense of a college educated man, trained in classical rhetoric and English history, strained through fascist ideology. A large section of the book is a fascist account of English history:""These Puritans, however, had drunk all too deeply of Jewish philosophy. They were not content to read the Old Testament. They must needs identify themselves with the figures in it. They called themselves by such names as ""Hew-Agag-In-Pieces-Before-The-Lord"". Ben Jonson was hardly exaggerating when he called his Puritans Tribulation Wholesome and Zeal-in-the- Land. Certainly the materialism of the Jews, as exposed in the Old Testament, had bitten deeply into their souls: for with all their psalms and all their hymns, they soon began to make money hand over fist. By some rather obscure process, they gradually insinuated themselves into the merchant classes, perhaps because their religion allowed them no vice except that of loving money. If their entry into the plutocracy is not easy to explain, there is no difficulty in explaining why so many merchants became Puritans. The reason was that it sounded much more dignified to protest against the Crown in defence of religious liberty than in attempted evasion of taxes.""What great rhetoric with low humor, inviting the downtrodden to mock the bourgeoisie.Consider this one:""All the time, the vast masses of the people were living in needless poverty: and the main strategic purpose of the ruling classes was to keep them in contented subjection, the Conservatives by preaching sacrifice and the Liberals, in their day, by distributing pourboires instead of wages. When the Socialists made their appearance, the paramount necessity was to convert their leaders into honorary members of the ruling classes as quickly as possible; the presence in their ranks of a certain number of young men of ""good family"" provided both the opportunity and the illusion.""Clearly, this is directed at the Labor movement, but consider the use of the word ""pourboires"" - meaning a ""tip"" or ""gratuity"" - who was he writing for? Would this have been understood by the lower classes? Do we expect this erudition to drip from the tongues of Brownshirts?  Elsewhere he makes a reference to ""yclept"" - an archaic way of seeing ""by name"" - which was the last thing I expected to see in the writings of a street brawler/Nazi supporter.Here's another one:""Amongst the nations that demanded the right to manufacture their own goods, the German States were prominent. As the three different Zollvereine became more closely coordinated, German economic strength grew: and when Bismarck lit his famous cigar on the field of Sadowa, he was also kindling the envy of the Jewish-minded English plutocracy. When, in 1871, the German Empire was proclaimed in Versailles, the godfearing profiteers of the City of London began to suspect that a serious commercial rival had appeared. The [34] influence of Queen Victoria was entirely in favour of friendship between the two countries: and the masses of the two peoples felt a natural and instinctive friendship for each other-- a psychological kinship which not even two wars have been able to destroy. But Queen Victoria's son and heir, Edward, Prince of Wales , began, as soon as he was physically capable, the dissolute life which was destined to make him the royal client of Jewish moneylenders and place the whole of his influence at the disposal of men like Speyer and Cassel.""""lit his famous cigar....""? I've never heard of that famous cigar, but now I want to know what Joyce, who I would previously have discounted as a clear lunatic, was talking about.A virtue of the book is that it does provide a window into the thinking of the German people and their leadership. To those of us who know the outcome of history, the entire Nazi period seems like lunacy and evil. At our most sympathetic, we wonder, ""what were they thinking?""  Did they really think they could win? Against the world?Actually, Joyce lays out a pretty good case for the internal weakness of England and its own propensity for having its food supplies cut by submarine embargo, which would have starved Britain into submission in the same way that Germany was starved into submission in World War I.  We know that is not how it came out - perhaps because of American support - but was that so clear at the time?Also, Joyce describes the German case for the justice of its war against Poland, including the oppression of the German nationals in Danzig and Poland, Polish intransigence in negotiation, the double-standard of Britain and France in selling out Czechoslovakia while baiting Poland into militarization, and Poland's pre-emptive strike on German facilities.Much of this case was based on outright lies manufactured by Hitler, of course, but that doesn't make the propaganda value that these claims had in the fog of war and at the moment of the crisis. Today, we wonder how the Germans could have supported their evil government; at the time, things were not as clear because of the dark arts of propaganda.If one is interested in ""alternate history"" as a literary genre, this is the stuff of alternate history novels.  It is eerie to think that if the Germans had won, then this book's major themes would have become the conventional wisdom of the world we might have lived in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIRGN1Z5A4A8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSIPMOM#wasThisHelpful","RIRGN1Z5A4A8B","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Patrick is always on his radio trying to make contact with someone, but always failing, while Jack teaches Lu math and reading.Post-apocalyptic domesticity.A large part of the movie is piecing the backstory together about what happened in the interim and why Jack doesn't like Patrick is and what happened to Lu's mom and why Jack is the ""father"" of Lu, although Patrick is really the father.  For a part of the movie I wondered if Patrick was there and the other two weren't, and vice-versa, but that turned out to be a red-herring.This part of the movie moved slowly, but I kind of liked it.Then, however, the next-gen zombies show up, and they are more like the monsters from Will Smith's ""I am Legend"" than from The Walking Dead.  These critters are fast, rapidly-healing, blind and vicious.The last thirty minutes turn into a white-knuckle fight, where zombies are everywhere, and our heroes are running out of ammunition, options and hope.All in all, it was a decent movie, although I think the long middle part will wear on the patience of most horror/monster flick enthusiasts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A0TBI4AJDIOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011M59WAA#wasThisHelpful","R1A0TBI4AJDIOL","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The movie works by taking its absurd premises and spinning them out to their logical ends.  Susan Sarandon likewise stars as Brady and Bill's eccentric mother.The premise of the movie is oddball.

"This is a powerful movie. The storyline is well-plotted and the acting is superb. There were some moments where I found myself a trifle lost - what happened to Vasili? How did they happen to go to just the right factory? - but I think the chief effect that the movie had on me was to set me wondering about my inability to imagine how I could live in a society that expected a husband to denounce a wife or that claimed there could be no murders in paradise.Tom Hardy is an MGB officer in Stalinist Russia in 1953. (The MGB was the predecessor to the KGB.) His job is to ""investigate"" espionage, and he seems quite content to do so, and seems to believe that is really what he is doing, although we see scenes that could have come from a witch-hunt, where one person who was no more guilty of espionage than anyone else was expected to denounce other people, strangers, names chosen at random, whatever, just to make the torture end, and then to get the surcease of suffering from a bullet to the back of the head in an interior courtyard. Families of traitors are summarily executed, leaving their orphans to remember the terror as a warning to others, as we see in one of the opening scenes.It is a wonder that this culture did not produce an entire culture of people walking around with untreated psychiatric conditions, particularly when you consider that this same population had been brutalized by invented famines and Nazi invasions.We can also understand how this culture could mass produce sadists.Hardy's character is set-up to denounce his wife, but he is basically a man of honor and, while tempted to do so, on the calculus that it is better to spare his entire family by sacrificing his wife, he cannot bring himself to do so when he learns that she is pregnant.  He is sent in disgrace to the ""ass"" of Russia where he learns that a child has been tortured, killed and gutted. He was investigating a case in Moscow with the same indications and discerns that there is a serial killer at work, albeit that term is not used since it would be anachronistic.From that point on he has to deal with Soviet politics and betrayals as he tries to uncover the murderer. While he is searching for the killer, his sadistic former underling is searching for him. He learns that his wife  - who he clearly loves and who he has sacrificed everything for - married him out of terror of the MGB.I think that last point will stick with me. What was it like to live in a culture that was so terrified? How psychotic must the world have been to the average Russian that they had to deny reality - they actually had to affirm delusions - or die?I will not give away the story any further, except to say that, yes, I too was crying at the conclusion, when Hardy is engaging in an act of atonement while wondering whether he is a monster.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P8C6ATCMFW4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0114M90CQ#wasThisHelpful","R3P8C6ATCMFW4K","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was fully prepared to ""like"" or ""love"" this book.  The idea of a serial killer using his wickedness to protect others - ala, I assume, Dexter - sounded like an interesting bit of escapist fiction, particularly when it morphs into the urban fantasy genre.But I am not sure that I liked this book.  I thought it was ""OK,"" but I had problems with the self-aware precociousness of the main character; he has known that he is an incipient serial killer since he was around 8 years old, he embraces that fact and he develops rules to protect other people from himself.OK....but ""8 years old""?  It just seems to precocious.  Likewise, his lack of empathy and psychopathy are consistent with his desire to protect others exactly how?  Sure, he is interested in self-preservation, but the book has him talking about how concerned he is about other people. Like Dexter, the story cheats to make him sympathetic by making him sympathize and be sympathetic, as a person with a disability, who knows he has a disability who spends all his time talking about his disability.  My sense is that real psychopaths are not like that at all; they feel superior to other people, and while they may mask their arrogance, as a hunter masks his scent, their inner lives do not involve being shy and humble.This seemed to be too much a suspension of disbelief for me throughout the book.Another problem I had was the long middle section when John Wayne Cleaver unmasks the killer and starts leaving the killer notes to taunt him.  I totally did not understand the wisdom or strategy or sense of this.  Perhaps it wasn't supposed to make any sense, in which case you have a punk playing stupid games, which detracts from any sense of sympathy I had.  Admittedly, how a 15 year old ramps up from serial-killer  fan-boy to serial killer-killer involves some development, but I didn't understand how the back and forth with the killer - including a phone call - was supposed to explain that development.Parts of the book were good, however.  I liked the writing, and I do like the main character as someone who is deluded about being a psychopath rather than being a psychopath. Of course, admittedly, working in a morgue as a child cannot be the most conducive way of developing a psychologically well-developed human.The plotting was OK, and there was a sense of suspense.I am likely to give one of the later books in the series a read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35STLJG3G0NY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765327821#wasThisHelpful","R35STLJG3G0NY3","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a terrific production of Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing.""Joss Whedon has taken the story and placed it in a modern day upscale house and neighborhood. The prince and gentlemen wear suits and the swords are revolvers.The dialogue, however, is authentically the Bard's.The use of modern props and tropes actually helped, in my mind, to translate the story into something accessible, and by the end, I was in the grip of a desire to see how it would all play out.Yes, certainly, from the standpoint of modern story-telling, there are coincidences galore and reliance on people being uncommonly dense, but - hey! - it's a classic art form.The actors were perfect, and drawn mostly from Joss Whedon's stable. Who knew that Alex Denisoff had an American accent?  And Amy Acker's sarcasm was perfect as Beatrice.There were at least two stand-out moments. One was the physical comedy of Amy Acker, as she played Beatrice scuttling around trying to overhear Hero and the maid's gossip about Benedick's putative love for her.The other was Nathan Fillion's comedy turn as Dogberry - an uncommonly dense police detective.Give the Bard a chance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IWD6P382GXQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESH04LQ#wasThisHelpful","R1IWD6P382GXQ7","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As the era of National Socialism recedes into the past, the less we tend to understand what it was that motivated the German people to accept an obvious fraud and clown like Hitler.Of course, we have the benefit of hindsight.  We know how the story turns out.  We can't help but see the Germany of 1933 through the lens of the Dachau and Auschwitz. The people of 1933 didn't know the future; they knew the present ""then"" and did not have the advantage of knowing where they decisions would lead. We have an ineluctable tendency to apply a ""retrospective fallacy"" of judging the past by the knowledge of the present.This book is a useful antidote to the retrospective fallacy. This is a collection of excerpts of Hitler's speeches from 1933 to 1938 which were carefully collated by the National Socialist regime for foreign consumption.  When we read these speeches, we can see how a German population might come to embrace Hitler and National Socialism for reasons other than anti-Semitism and an attraction toward evil.In the grip of the retrospective fallacy we forget the condition of German and the Germans in 1933 - the year of Hitler's accession to power.  At that that time, the Rhineland region was occupied by France, the Saar was effectively independent and would vote on independence, union with France or return to Germany in a few years, Germany was paying huge reparations, large sections of historic German territory had been removed from Germany, and Germans were relegated to pariah nation status by the ""War Guilt"" clauses of the Versailles Treaty. To attempt a contemporary analogy, it would be as if the United States had lost a war, and had the East Coast occupied, California made an independent province, lost Texas to Mexico and could not enter into equal trade treaties with foreign nations and had to acknowledge that it was responsible for its humiliation.These issues run though Hitler's speeches. For example, Hitler constantly appealed to notions of equality:""Germany desires nothing except an equal right to live and equal freedom...The German nation wishes to live in peace with the rest of the world....Our love of peace is perhaps greater than that of other nations, for we suffered most from this unhappy war."" (May 21, 2935)""The German struggle for equality of rights, which we regard as a struggle for the honour and inalienable fights of our people and which we will therefore never abandon, can in my opinion best be brought to an end by reconciliation between the two great nations who have so often during the past centuries spilled the blood of their best sons on the field of battle without essentially changing thereby the underlying facts..France fears for her security.  Nobody in Germany intends to menace it, and we are ready to do whatever is possible to sun."" (January 30, 1934.)Some takeaways: (1) when someone starts speaking in terms of ""equality,"" watch out, and (2) dictators will lie without blinking an eye.This book is arranged by topic. So, the outtakes of speeches are divided into subjects, such as ""The New German Army,"" ""The Consequences of Versailles,"" ""The Peasantry,"" The Winter Help Organization"" and ""National Socialism and Christianity.""A couple of interesting things I learned were (1) Hitler's economic theory blamed the Depression on the Versailles Treaty: a consequence of the Versailles Treaty was that Germany had to often pay off its reparation obligation through raw material dumps onto the market or the export of cheap German goods, which Hitler interpreted as a reason for the unraveling of international commerce.  I vaguely remember this as a reason for the Depression in a high school history class.  (2) Hitler explained German surrender as a salvific act on the part of Germany, i.e., an attempt to protect Europe from the Bolshevik revolution that was breaking out in Germany.  You can almost see how he could make this claim in terms of the timing of revolution and German defeat.I am interested in Hitler and religion, so my focus was on that issue.  Frankly, we don't see a lot of Hitlerian religiosity.  In the approximate 100 pages of this short book, around 4 might betray some religious sentiment.  Hitler is all over the map on the subject. Thus, on May 21, 1933, he affirms that he felt obliged ""as the Fuhrer of the German nation, responsible to God and my own conscience,"" however in 1935 (p. 14), Hitler speaks of being permitted by ""Providence"" to restore honour to the German people. (p. 15, 46) Elsewhere, Hitler declares:""There is but one commander of this conscience of mine - namely, the nation - the German nation and the pick of it that is united in the Movement, in the National Socialist Party.  In everything that I do this is the only commander to which I feel myself responsible."" (October 6, 1935, p. 59.)Elsewhere he reminds his listeners that they are members of the German nation ""by God's will"" (May 1, 1935, p. 66) and he leads a prayer, stating ""No Lord, the German nation is strong again its own will, strong in perseverance and strong to make every sacrifice. Lord, we will not let thee go!""(May 1, 1935, p. 91.)(See also p. 92 for a prayer from 1938.)In short, there is enough there to answer that Hitler was an atheist, a theist and a pagan.The philosophy of authority and Darwinism make an appearance:""Thus, the sine qua non for, and basis, of the State is, and always will be, the authority embodied in the will to the maintenance of the State."" (p.44.)And:""With infallibility we are steering towards an order of things in which a process of selection will become active in the political leadership of the nation, as it exists throughout the wholoe of life in general. By the process of selection, which will follow the rules of Nature and the dictates of human reason, those among our people who show the greatest natural ability will be appointed to positions in the political leadership of the nation."" (P. 46.)Excerpts from Hitler's 1933 speeches on Christianity are also contained in this book In these speeches, Hitler affirms that the two Christian denominations will play an important role in the Reich but:""But they cannot permit that the fact of belonging to a certain confession or a certain race should constitute a release from general legal obligations or even license for the commission of crimes with impunity, or for its toleration. (March 23, 1033, p. 90.)Hitler also warns that ""But under no condition whatsoever will the National Socialist State permit religious denominations to engage in political activities, whether these activities be a continuance of the old tradition or something started afresh.  And here I should like to issue a definite warning against the entertaining of any illusions whatsoever in regard to the fixed determination of the Movement and the STate.  We have already fought the clerical politicians and forced them to leave Parliament.  It was a long struggle during which we held no public power whatsoever, whereas the others held all the power in their hands."" (1945, p. 92.)There seem to be about two references to anti-semitism. The balance of the speeches presents Hitler as a not untypical politician trying to influence things for his German constituency.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UYX9SFSEPERJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1905742126#wasThisHelpful","R2UYX9SFSEPERJ","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I haven't read Shutter, so this short story compressed a lot of informaiton into a short span.It seems that in this world the Dracula story is in some sense literally true.  The main character is a ""Helsing"" and her family runs a corporation/army/paramilitary organization that hunts ""necros.""  It wasn't clear what necros are, but she deals with one that is superstrong, superfast and has scissor-like claws.  She's 15 years old and her father takes her out to hunt the ""scissor-claw"" necro. The hunt goes bad and the necro terrorizes the Fisherman's Warf section of San Francisco, which raises the question of where these Helsing's are stationed: all over the world?; but their leadership seems to be in San Francisco.There is also a family dynamic where Dad wants the protagonist to become a hunter and her Mom wants her to live up to her potential as an exorcist.There is action and adventure.

"I have found Charles Stross's ""Laundry"" series to be consistently enjoyable.  The stories have followed the rise of everyman Bob Howard through the super-secret department of British military intelligence called the  Laundry in classic John Le Carre spy-speak.  The Laundry's wheelhouse is dealing with the occult that are being released increasingly more often by the advent of high level computing; it is the fact of mind and mathematics, apparently, that affect the real structure of the universe.  Bob has moved from involuntary draftee as a result of stumbling into the occult via computing into field work against eldritch horrors to minor functionary in the Laundry and, as of the last book which killed off the legendary Angleton, to being the current host of the Eater of Souls.  During this time he has wooed and married Dr. Dominique O'Brien aka ""Mo"", a beautiful redhead with a cursed violin.The fun of the Laundry Files is how Stross works LeCarre's spycraft, stratospheric levels of nerd culture and the Cthulhu mythos into an eclectic pastiche.  Another fun aspect is how Stross works each book into a different genre.  The early books were Cthulhu horror, one book was James Bond, the last book was a vampire story, and this one, most improbably of all, and yet completely logical, is a superhero story, complete with origin stories and flamboyant characters with costumes and superpowers.Apparently, as the stars have have come into the dread configuration presaging Case Nightmare Green, the interpenetration of the other place where the mindless horrors who threaten human existence reside is becoming more complete. This phenomenon is giving average people ""superpowers.""  It's really the ""ritual magic"" that the Laundry specializes in, and has turned into a science and technology, but the contemporary mind conceives of this turn of events as involving superpowers.Enter Dominique O'Brien.  This novel starts right at the end of the last novel, with O'Brien crashing in on Bob and Bob's ex-girlfriend, and current vampire, who seem to be in a compromising position, except that's a mistake.  Unfortunately, O'Brien's cursed violin has issues with Bob's new status as Eater of Souls and the couple are estranged.Then, it seems that O'Brien has to deal with an outbreak of superpowers by forming her own superhero team - including herself, a mermaid (from the James Bond Laundry novel), the vampire, and a superpowered British cop who goes by the name ""Officer Friendly."" A supervillain runs rings around O'Brien's team as she has to create her ""Transhuman Police Force"" and deal with British bureaucratic regulations and the collapse of her marriage and the possibility that a mole is in her team and a burgeoning romance with Officer Friendly and the increasing power of her evil, quasi-sentient violin.All the balls are kept in the air with a mashing of superhero motifs and spycraft and bureaucratic-jargon.The story works mostly. A nit I picked was how easily Mo was able to shunt aside Bob for Officer Friendly.  I didn't buy the break-up at the end, but I wonder if Bob isn't becoming less of a human thing with his amalgamation with the Eater of Souls. The fun part of Bob was his lack of confidence, his learning the ropes and the vast pools of ignorance, lit up by the occasional nerd gem of knowledge, that made him our entry-point into this mad world.  Maybe Bob is off the books as our focal character from this point on?  Or maybe Stross intends to two-track the Laundry Files into ""Mo books"" and ""Bob Books""?A final bit of advice I would give is that if you have not read the previous Laundry File books, do not start here.  The story arc and mythos of the series is too far along without a new reader wondering what is going on.  Start here and a new reader might give up reading the rest of the series out of frustration.Which would be a shame.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VW8M0MMKZLSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW1VO14#wasThisHelpful","R3VW8M0MMKZLSO","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am conflicted in my assessment and understanding of this book. The book is elegantly written.  The prose and story are somber and direct. The setting is rich and I think it offers some insight into the relevant society and culture.  I am not sure, however, what the author intended me to get out of the book or whether what I got out of the book is ""right"" or my projection. I am going to describe the events of the story, so if you are not interested in ""spoilers"" do not read on.This book is set in Japan circa 1630, well into the period when Japan had outlawed and cruelly repressed Christianity.  Christianity had been introduced into Japan around 1550 by Portuguese Jesuits, where it had met with success.  By the late 16th century, it is estimated that 400,000 Japanese had converted; some conversions were shallow and superficial, but others were deep and authentic, deep enough for a number of Japanese Christians to welcome martyrdom, and for others to go underground as ""Hidden Christians"" (Kakure Kurishitan) where they would keep a strange and mutated form of Christianity alive for 300 years. The survival of even a mutated form of Christianity in Japan is a story worth telling in light of the horrible repression that was visited upon the Kakure Kurishitan community, repressions involving stepping on the ""fumi"" - an image of Christ - and horrible tortures designed to force Christians to renounce Christianity.The story opens with a Jesuit priest Sebastio Rodriguez and two other Jesuits leaving Portugal to travel to Japan to investigate the truth behind the news that their mentor, Cristvo Ferreira, Cristvo Ferreira, had been tortured into apostatizing.  The opening part of the book is told in the form of letters home by Rodriguez as he endures the difficulty of traveling to the Orient, being told by his superiors that Japan has been closed to missionary activity, and then being permitted to travel to Japan with his one companion, Garrpe, who is not too ill to travel. Rodriguez and Garrpe enter Japan with the assistance of a loathsome, cowardly, lazy, drunk renegade Japanese person named Kichijiro, who is obviously a Christian, but who may have apostatized.  Kichijiro denies being a Christian but leads the Jesuits to a Christian village.The story turns into a first person contemporary account of how Rodriguez and Garrpe are taken in by the village, who are delighted to have a priest hear their confessions. The mobility is restricted, as they have to stay within a hut for months.  The Japanese Christians have organized themselves into a society where the ""Jiisama"" baptizes and the ""Tossama"" teaches the prayers and keeps the Christian calendar. Rodriguez and Garrpe split up and Rodriguez travels to another village with Kichijiro.  After some time in that village, Rodriguez returns to the village, but the village is betrayed and the local leaders do not apostatize but are tied to stakes in the ocean until they drown. Rodriguez goes on the run with Kichijiro, until he is betrayed by Kichijiro and captured by the governor of the province, a former Christian named Inoue.At this point, the story shifts from the first person narrative to a third person narrative. The shift is subtle; I didn't notice until I reread the story for this review. Clearly, we are being distanced from an immediacy with the priest in the latter part of the story for narrative effect.Inoue's goal is not to kill the priest, but to cause him to apostatize, so that other Christians will lose faith and return to traditional Japanese spirituality.  Rodriguez has several discussions with Inoue about the nature of truth and the ability of Japan to absorb the foreign spirituality of Christianity.  I am not sure if Inoue is the foil for the Shusaku Endo's view of Japan and Christianity; Inoue argues that ""Japan is a swamp"" and that the roots of Christianity have been cut and that Japan will distort and corrupt Christianity.  To a certain extent, this was historically correct, as the Kakure Kurishitan culture mutated Christian belief into an entirely new form that although somewhat recognizable to Catholic Christians is a caricature of belief and doctrine. (See Beginning of Heaven and Earth: The Sacred Book of Japan's Hidden Christians (Nanzan Library of Asian Religion & Culture).)  On the other hand, Inoue's argument is also that (a) Japan would never have accepted Christianity and (b) a true form of Christianity could not have endured even if there had not been Japanese persecution.  This seems obviously wrong; Kakure Kurishitan communities survived for 300 years, there must have been something in Christianity attractive and congenial to Japanese culture that allowed it to endure under such horrible circumstances.What that factor might have been is alluded to in passing by Endo.  Rodriguez notes early on:""Yet the magistrate of Nagasaki exacts from them an exceedingly harsh revenue.  I tell you the truth for a long, long time these farmers have worked like horses and cattle; and like horses and cattle they have died. The reason our religion has penetrated this territory like water lowing into dry earth is that it has given to this group of people a human warmth they never previously knew.  For the first time they have met men who treated them like human beings. It was the human kindness and charity of the fathers that touched their hearts."" (p. 32.)This rings true with the history. (See In Search of Japan's Hidden Christians: A Story of Suppression, Secrecy and Survival.)  And, of course, there was also the promise of a paradise in the next world.Rodriguez responds with the Western notion that truth is universal, and to this there is no response.Eventually, the Japanese magistrate hits upon what seems to be a tried and true technique for obtaining the apostasy of priests; he threatens to kill Japanese Christians, and does so when there is any hesitation, all the while telling the priest that this is the priest's fault.  The first time this happens, people known to Rodriguez are wrapped in mats and thrown into the ocean to drown.  Father Garrpe rushes into the ocean to save them and also drowns.  The second time, Rodriguez is left in a room where he hears snoring, except the snoring is not snoring, it is the moan of pain of Christians who, although they have already apostatized, have been tied up and suspended upside down over a pit of excrement, with tiny cuts behind their ears so that they are slowly bleeding to death. On this occasion, Rodriguez is visited by Ferreira, who has gone native, and taken the name and wife of a dead Japanese man. Ferreira explains that he also apostatized when faced with this cruel and apparently meaningless suffering, but that now he is ""useful"" because he translates Western books of astronomy for the governor.  We also learn that Ferreira is writing a counter-apologetics text for the Japanese, although Ferreira is ashamed to mention this. Inoue also appears and advises Rodriguez that his quest is futile, Japan will never become Christian, the roots are cut, he is alone, and his prideful efforts are causing the Japanese to suffer.  Rodriguez is presented with the fumi and told that stepping on it is a mere formality that need have nothing to do with his true feelings.  Rodriguez has a vision where he understands that even Christ would have apostatized in those circumstances and Christ tells Rodriguez ""Trample! Trample! I more than anyone know of the pain in your foot. Trample! It was to be trampled on by men that I was born into this world. It was to share men's pain that I carried my cross.""  This chapter concludes:""The priest placed his foot on the fumie. Dawn broke. And far in the distance, the crock crew."" (p. 171.)Rodriguez is then given clothes and a nice place to live, although his movements are restricted. Eventually he is given the name and family of a Japanese man who has died.The story ends with two ""odd"" notes.  First, Kichijiro comes to Rodriguez for confession.  This appears to be authentic on the part of Kichijiro.  Rodriguez knows that he has been disgraced and that his priestly faculties have been removed, but since he is the only priest - apostate or not - who can do it, he hears Kichijiro's confession. Second, near the end of the story there is an interlude consisting of diary entries from a Dutch shipping clerk which imply that Ferreira is implicating the Dutch with secretly importing Catholicism into Japan. Does this mean that in some way, Ferriera is taking revenge on the Protestants who undermined the Catholic mission? But if he was a real apostate, why would he do that?Sprinkled throughout the book is what I took to be Endo's post-modern contribution, namely, the idea that God is silent in the face of the suffering of His followers. On one level this struck me as being an entirely artificial and anachronistic injection of post-modern ideology into the story.  Endo points out that there is a lot of suffering in this world; the voyage to Japan is suffering; the repression of the peasants is suffering; the torture is suffering. However, this all seems to hit Rodriguez like a ton of bricks only when he is in Japan, and he doesn't seem to have any philosophical resources to deal with it. I don't buy it.  This aspect of the story reminded me of The Sparrow: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle) - a science fiction story with much the same theme.  The fact is that Catholicism isn't surprised by suffering; theologies of suffering, offering up suffering, joining personal suffering to that of Christ, etc., are all the bread and butter of Catholicism, particularly in this period when the suffering of the Saints was a subject of artistic flourish.However, on a deeper level, I wonder if there isn't an answer to this question of ""God's silence.""  Obviously, to the Japanese Christians were were being tortured, God was not silent; not only did they have their faith but their prayers for release were answered by Rodriguez's apostasy.  Presumably, when Rodriguez apostatized, the victims were taken down and returned to their villages. So, God does work in mysterious ways. Further, the idea that God was silent in Japan is bizarre; the faith of the Kakure Kurishitan in the core of Christianity, however mutated, that God loves each person individually through his son, screams like a siren to anyone with ears to hear.Further, did Rodriguez really apostatize?  On his terms it seems he did since he did not get his glorious martyrdom, but on Christian terms - as Endo explains - he fulfilled the Christian commandment to love; if there is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's neighbor, then what kind of love is there in laying down one's faith and dreams? And then there is the end where Kichijiro confesses: if Rodriguez's hearing of Kichijiro's confession meant that Kichijiro was saved, even after Purgatory, that is a victory.If the book ignores these theological aspects, then it is shallow and well-tuned to the superficial theologizing of post-modernity, which may be why Martin Scorsese is making a movie out of this book. (I do not expect anything more from Scorsese than a film that confirms his view that there really is nothing there after all.) On the other hand, if these grace notes - which exist in the barely spoken subtext of the book - are true,then there is a Catholic story here.Now, admittedly, I am not comfortable with a theology that says that the highest form of love is apostasy or that Christ would encourage apostasy, but Catholicism is a religion that counts prudence as a virtue, and a formal apostasy out of love is not entirely imprudent.Incidentally, there is a truth behind the story of Christovao Ferreira. The historical Ferreira (1580-1650) was appointed Vice Provincial of the Japanese Jesuits. The historical Ferreira was tortured in the pit and apostatized after six hours. Thereafter, he assisted in torturing other priests and breaking them physically and psychologically.  Like other priests who apostatized, he was given a Japanese name and a Japanese wife (often the widow of a criminal) and he wrote an anti-Christian tract called ""A Disclosure of Falsehood.""So, a Catholic is not in the position of saying that such things never happened or that there was a 100% rate of martyrdom.  Some priests - in fact, in the case of Ferreira, one of the highest ranking - did apostatize. In many ways, Endo has ""softened"" the blow of the apostasy in this story, since Ferreira apostatizes out of horror at, and love for, his Japanese Christian flock, rather than ""merely"" to avoid a horrible and lonely death. (Nonetheless, one has to note the importance of psychological blackmail and the propaganda value of creating traitors even at this early date in human history.)So, yes, this is a conflicted text, well worth pondering. One thing is for certain, if you don't want a book that is depressing or hif you have a weak faith, this is not a book that you will find worthwhile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UON8NKJ7AG5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800871863#wasThisHelpful","R2UON8NKJ7AG5M","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the 16th century Catholic Christianity was making tremendous progress in Japan.  The Jesuits, Franciscans and Augustinians were opening churches and seminaries and had converted - superficially, perhaps - something like 400,000 Japanese.  Much of the conversion was superficial and a product of opportunism and politics, but there was also a layer of Japanese who converted because of the Christian message of hope and human dignity. Peasants who had been treated as little better than horses found something attractive in a religion that taught that in some way they had a dignity that the Lord of the universe loved.At the end of the 16th century, there was a sea change in Japanese-Christian relationships as the newly empowered Shoguns outlawed Christianity, ejected missionaries and executed in cruel and horrible ways those who refused to apostatize.However, notwithstanding the repression, Christianity went underground and survived for the next 300 years, until Japan was reopened during the 1860s.  During that time, Christianity mutated.  The Christian stories were barely understood and, more importantly, the context of the stories was missing.  Hidden Christians (""Kakure Kurishitan"") had to interpolate the connections through their understanding and myths and through the theology that Buddhism had to offer.This book provides the only written record of the Kakure Kurishitan story - the Tenchi, also known as ""The Beginning of Heaven and Earth.""  The Tenchi is fascinating.  It is as if you had to teach some group of children the basic elements of Christianity and they had to reconstruct a coherent story from what you told them 40 years later.  So, the Tenchi has a Creation myth, but God is ""Deusu"" and Lucifer is ""Yusuhero.""  Deusu has more ranks and forms than even the Buddha; Yusuhero tries to usurp Deusu's place before the anjo and Domeigosu-no-Adan and Domeigosu-no-Ewe, which requires Adan and Ewe to say the salve regina, which is the basis of the Contrition orassho. Yusehero convinces Adan and Ewe to eat the fruit of the masan, which results in their eviction from Pariaso and Ewe being turned into a dog in Middle Heaven. There is a flood story and Deusu divides himself into two persons - Deusu and the divine son, Hiiryo-sama.  Maruya appears as a lovely virgin who is courted by the King of Ronzon - which is the Philippines. Her virtue is such that she ascends to heave in a flower wagon, then returns and gives birth to the son, and has adventures. The Kings of Mexico, France and Turkey visit the Holy One, but tip of the King of the Land, Yorotetsu, about the Holy One. Yorotetsu has his retainers, Ponsha and Piroto, slaughter the innocent children of the land. The Holy One goes to Rome and then returns to be killed by Yorotetsu, but then goes to heaven, returns to Earth for 40 days to teach his head disciple - Pappa.  The Holy One was betrayed by Judatsu, who hanged himself in grief after being admonished ""Now look here, Judatsu, you must have betrayed our master. You treacherous bastard.""What a strange melange; it is as if someone tried to recreate the history of late 20th century America from nothing but Marvel comics.The Tenchi is preceded by an excellent introduction that provides the historical and sociological context of the Kakure Kurishitan and some insights intot the writing of the Tenchi.  The Tenchi itself has numerous footnotes that lead to information that is essential for unraveling the often confusing text.One thing I wonder about after reading this text is what enduring role the Japanese attitude toward Kakure Kurishitan had on recent history, particularly Japan's actions in World War II. The translator, Christal Whelan, points out that the characters used for ""Kirishitan"" were changed to communicate either ""to cut limbs until they bleed"" or ""a demon's ideology hungry for the dead.""  Kakure Kurishitans were being crucified up to few years before the opening of Japan in the 1860s.  In short, Japan had a nearly 300 year history of treating Christianity as a form of devil worship, an infection that had to be routed out with extreme prejudice.Did this attitude die out between 1860 and 1940?  That seems unlikely.  If it didn't, then what would we expect when people conditioned to believe that Christians were loathsome devil worshippers acquired prisoners who were Christian?  Certainly, the Japanese had a poor reputation for their treatment of prisoners from Asian countries, but one has to wonder if this bit of history played any role in Japanese atrocities like the Bataan Death March.I found this fascinating since I read In Search of Japan's Hidden Christians: A Story of Suppression, Secrecy and Survival and Silence, but it might interest people interested in Christian history, Japanese history or the sociology of religion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNX9C0D1VUHMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0824818245#wasThisHelpful","RNX9C0D1VUHMQ","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know why I started this book with the expectation that I would find out that Catholic theologians were supportive of the Nazi regime.  It might be the cover - with the swastika superimposed over the cathedral of Cologne - or the conventional wisdom that insinuates that Catholicism was a factor that supported the Nazis.  While this book does focus on a few theologians who supported National Socialist party (""NS"") in the early years, it seems that most Catholic theologians were anti-Nazi and that the ones who flirted with the Nazis backed off of that support after a few years.The book is set up by chapters that discuss specific theologians preceded and followed by an introduction and a conclusion.  The author, Robert Krieg, is very good at attempting to understand why the Catholics of Germany did what they in terms of their own understanding of their own theology.  Too many books of this sort impose a retrospective judgment on historical actors which amounts to nothing more than polemics and a ""retrospective fallacy.""For me the fascinating thing about this book was the litany of admirable men who courageously followed their faith.  This book is not a hagiography.  It seems that it ought to be the kind of book that lists the failings of Catholics and that calls for a reconsideration of Catholicism.  But I couldn't read it that way because even when it mentioned a philo-Nazi theologian, every page would mention numerous other Catholics who were repressed or oppressed and persecuted and stood by their faith. I came to learn of people I had never heard of, eg.., Bishops Kammers and Frings, and realize that there was more to this history than I was hearing from most sources.Chapter 1 - The Bishop's Accommodation with Hitler in 1933When Hitler was named Chancellor, the Bishops came to a fork in the road because they had condemned Hitler's ideology and the Hitler had denounced the churches and preached racist and neopagan idea in his party's platofrom of 1920 and Mein Kampf. (p. 1.)  The 25 bishops led around 1/3 of Germany's population and were assisted by 21,000 priests and 100,000 members of religious orders. (Id.) The Fulda conference was established in 1933. (p. 2.) Catholic bishops, priests and lay leaders had criticized the NS since the 1020s. (Id.) On September 20, 1933, a priest in Hesse condemned membership in the NS and was supported by his bishop Ludwig Maria Hugo of Mainz. (p.2) Bp. Hugo won the support of the conference of Catholic bishops; in 1931 Cardinal Faulhaber  warned against the NS and was followed by Cologne's Cardinal Bertram and Archbp Schulte. (p. 22)  1 out of 7 voted for the NS in July of 1932, whereas two of five non-Catholics supported the NS in the same election. (p.3.)  Many priests denied communion to members who wore a NS uniform. (Id.)Hitler's rise to power through legitimate means forced the bishops to reassess their political views. (p. 3.) From January to Germany of 1933, Germany seemed to be falling into chaos. NS storm troopers beat up prominent Catholics like Adam Stegerwald, the Reichstag burned, Hindenburg issued his Edict for the protection of People and State which made it legally possible for the chancellor to incarcerate political opponents. (p. 3.) ""Given the strength of the National Socialist state, the bishops reconsidered their stance against membership in the Nazi party."" (p. 3.)Catholics still did not back the NS in the March 5, 1933 elections. 5.5 million Catholics voted for the Center and 7 million divided their votes among  the seven other parties.  Prominent Catholics called for a  rapprochement of church and party, and, on March 23, 1933 Hitler ""reiterated seeming new respect for the Protestant and Catholic churches."" (sic)(p. 4.) The bishops dropped the prohibition on membership in the NS on March 28, 1933. (p.5.)  The NS waged a strong anti-Catholic campaign in June of 1933, disrupting the national meeting of the Kolping society by assaulting members on the street and imprisoning 2,000 members of the Bavarian People's Party, who they released only after the BPP and Center party dissolved themselves in early July. (p. 7.) The NS continued to harass Catholic leaders even after the signing of the Reich Concordat on July 20, 1933.Krieg is unique in the books I've read for offering the Catholic understanding of the Catholic Church. After Vatican I, the church developed a Neo-scholastic theology of ""societas perfectas"" - the Catholic Church was the ""perfect society"", which meant that it was not part of a secular society and was a hierarchical society, that stood apart from modernity, safeguards the truth and prizes those governments that establish Catholicism as the state's religion. (p. 10.) The Church's mission was to bring God's saving grace to all mankind through the sacraments. (p. 11; See Quas Primas.) The Church was held to be a ""society chartered by divine right, perfect inits nature in its title..""(p. 12; See Immortale Dei), and not merely a human institution. (Pascendi Dominici Gregis.)The church contemplated the relationship of church and state through the ""Gelasian dyarchy,"" whereby God entrusted spiritual power to the church and temporal power to the state, and the church had ""indirect authority"" over the state. (p.18.) Krieg believes that the bishops had become weaker as a result of centralization in the Vatican and that they inadequately measured the sentiments of Catholic opposition to the NS, including the opposition in Catholic papers. (p. 22 - 23.) The bishops  felt theat their first responsibility was to the self-sufficient institution of the church; the pope's first obligation was to safeguard the Church as the ""necessary means of providing the sacrament with gave the grace needed for salvation."" (p. 26 - 27.) The focus of the German bishops and the Vatican was making sure that the NS did not close parishes and imprison pastors as happened during the Kulturkampf. (p. 27.)The NS dismissed Jewish theological faculty and members of the Center party and others. (p. 28 - 29.) Krieg examines the claim that it was the progressive theologians who supported Hitler and points out that while the theologians who supported Hitler were theologically progressive but socially conservative. (p. 30.)2. Karl EschweilerThe reader is also introduced to Bp Kaller of Ermland, an unsung hero of Catholic and Nazism, in whose diocese Eschweiler was the dean of Bransberg's Hochschule.  Kaller was a committed anti-Nazi, who continued to speak out against the Nazis after 1934, and was labeled an ""enemy of the state"" in 1938, but nonetheless assisted incarcerated Jews and Jewish Catholics at Theresianstadt and helped war refugees. 1/3 of his diocese's priests died at the hands of the Nazis or during the war. (p. 45.)In the course of this chapter we learn about Waldemar Gurian, who opposed right wing movements and fled Germany and about Paul Landsberg was incarcerated because of his Jewish race and died Oranienberg. (Id.)Eschweiler promoted cooperation between the Church and Hitler. Eschweiler taught at Bonn and was part of Bonn's ""progressive spirit in scholarship."" (p. 33.) Eschweller believed that Catholicism and the NS had compatible worldviews. Eschweirler believed that grace did not ""destroy the properly God-given abilities of those  who were born German,"" but preserved and developed those natural abilities. Grace perfected nature and the swastika was an expression of Aquinas's understanding of the union of the supernatural and the natural orders. (p. 48.) Catholics should strengthen the healthy elements of the NS so that the NS would not be corrupted by the anti-Christian element who espoused Nietzsche. (p. 48.)  After the NS state passed the sterilization laws, Eschweiler supported the law, in the fact of Catholic teaching to the contrary, on the grounds that  since ""grace perfects nature,"" ""God's grace cannot  make up for the natural deficiency of someone who is mentally deficient"" and not suited to be a parent. (p. 49.) However, in late 1933, Pacelli began to initiate canonical proceedings against Eschweiler because of his position. (p.50.) He recanted and was reinstated. He died in 1936 and was lauded by Rosenberg as ""a martyr to the Roman system."" (p. 51.) Eschweiller was progressive in moving away from scholasticism but ""reactionary"" because he perceived no common ground between Catholicism and modernity. (p. 54.)While Eschweiler was promoting the NS state at Bruansberg, his former professors at Bonn were doing the opposite. (p. 51.) Hitler's appointment of Rosenberg as the NS official philosopher on January 24 1934 alarmed church officials. (p.52.) Schulte met Hitler who dismissed his criticisms because Schulte had opposed the NS. (p. 53.) Schulte appointed Rev. Josef Teusch to direct a defense against the NS program. (p.52.) Tuesch cooperated with Bp. Clemens von Galen to issue an anti-Rosenberg pamphlet in Glaen's name. (Id.)3. Joseph Lortz:Lortz was a leading ecumenist who wrote a book essentially rehabilitating Luther for Catholics. (p. 56.) Lortz also argued that there was a ""kinship"" between the NS and Catholicism in opposition to Bolshevism, relativism and liberalism and recognition of the ""natural orders of creation"" and in affirming social unity. (p. 64.) Lortz was associated with the pacifist Max Metzge, who was executed during the war. (p. 79.)By 1935, Lortz saw that the anti-Christian voices in the NS movement were determining Hitler's decision. (p. 66.) Lortz modified his previous writing to eliminate favorable observations about the NS in subsequent editions of publications. (p. 67.)In Wurzburg, Bp Matthias Ehrenfried was an outspoken critic of the NS who challenged the Nazis. (p. 67.) The Nazis responded by incarcerating 30 of his priests, breaking into the bishop's residence, physically abusing the people there and destroying property. (p. 68.)  The Gestapo conducted destructive searches of faculty residences. (Id.)Sebastian Merkle was another theologian who was initially supportive of Nazism, but by 1935 had become a ""sharp critic"" of the NS. (p. 70.)The University of Munster was under the jurisdiction of Bishop Galen. (p. 72.)  Professor Schmidlin refused to give the ""Heil Hitler"" salute. He was forced into retirement and died in a concentration camp. (p. 73.) George Schriber was another professor who was anti-nazi and eventually went into hiding after the 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler because he had been a former leader of the Center Party.(p. 74.)Galens was an untiring opponent of the Nazis, who attacked Rosenberg.  Galens was a German patriot but anti-Nazi.  He supported the remilitarization of the Rhineland and the encouraged Germans to join the Wehrmacht after the invasion of Poland, but he preached against the euthanasia of the disabled.4. Karl AdamKarl Adam was a significant Catholic intellectual who in 1933 spoke of Hitler in messianic terms. (p. 83.)  Adam was a proponent of ""reform Catholicism."" Adams also wrote in terms of grace perfecting nature P. 98), but while he supported the laws restricting the involvement of Jews in German society, he also held that Christians should respect Jews and could not deny that Jesus was Jewish. (p. 99.) In late 1933, Adams became concerned with German paganism and gave a speech critical of Neopaganism in January of 1934. (p. 100.) Thereafter the NS attacked Adams in order to intimidate him. (p. 100 - 101.) On the other hand, Adam's writings from 1943 were anti-Jewish, e.g., because of the immaculate conception, Jesus did not possess the negative traits associated with being Jewish. (p. 103.)In 1939, Adams advocated that German priests be inducted into the army. (p. 101.)Adam had connections to Tubingen which was under the jurisdiction of the anti-Nazi Bishop Sproll. (p. 93.) Sproll's opposition came to a head in April of 1938 when Sproll refused to vote in favor the annexation of Austria. Sproll's liefe was threatened, demonstrations occurred outside of his residence, his associates were executed for treason and Sproll went into hiding from 1943 to 1945.Faulhaber in Munich was an opponent of Nazism. Munich nurtured anti-Nazi opposition: Rupert Mayer was arrested and slated for execution; the White Rose emerged at the University of Munich. Krieg seems to associate the rioting against Faulhaber on November 12, 1938 with Faulhaber's resistance to the appointment of a pro-nazi to the faculty, rather than Kristalnacht. (p. 96.)5. Romano GuardiniGuardini was a professor at the University of Berlin, who remained an inveterate anti-Nazi throughout his career. Guardini viewed the NS as a form of idolatry. (p. 114.) Heil means ""savior"" and the greeting ""Heil Hitler"" meant ""health to you"" and ""health to you through Hitler.""(p. 115.) Guardini's writings challenged the NS and it retaliated by stripping him ofhsi teaching positions and banning his books. (p. 119.)Bertram and Breslau:  Betram was the official leader of the Catholic Bishops.  He attempted to deal with Nazi/Catholic issues on a pragmatic basis. (p. 110.) on the other hand, he required his seminarians at the University of Breslau to avoid taking classes from a Nazi instructor foisted on the seminary. (p. 11.)Bishop Preysing of Berlin was an inveterate anti-Nazi, who helped write Mit Brennender Sorge and refused to ring church bells for Wehrmacht victories and disapproved Cardinal Bertram's birthday greeting in 1940. (p. 113.) Preysing established a diocesan committee to help everyone, including Jews. (p. 113.)6. Engelbert KrebsBoth Krebs and Martin Heidegger were at the University of Freiburg.  Heidegger was a famous philosopher and pro-Nazi. In 1926, Krebs wrote against ""vulgar antisemitism."" (p. 137.) Krebs was among the thread of Catholics who recognized that Christian belief could not be separated from its Jewish origins. (p. 138.) Krebs privately confessed that Germany was being governed by ""robbers, murderers and criminals,"" a statement that would be used in treason trials against him. (p. 147.) Krebs escaped that, but ran into further problems when he was forbidden by the state to say mass or preach. (p. 149.)Freiburg's Bishop was Conrad Grober who tried to find common ground with the Nazis. (p. 141.) He advised his priests to take a conciliatory attitude toward it in order to influence it. (p. 141.) He may have donated personal funds to Nazi organizations. (p. 141.) Grober began to have doubts in 1935 as the state acted against Catholic organizations. (p. 142.) Julius Streicher criticized Grober for lack of patriotism. (p. 142.) Grober distanced himself the NS and by 1940 he was criticizing the NS and helping associations that aided Jews escape from Germany and he spoke in favor of Metzger. (p. 143.)7. Catholic Theology in Nazi GermanyKrieg notes that ""theological models"" were in conflict.  The prevailing model was that of the ""perfect society"" which conceived of the church as society in itself which had to perpetuate its existence to dispense the sacraments, but there was also the model of the church as moral advocate and body of Christ, who had a more pro-active role in society.  As the NS pressed on the church, these different approaches were played out in different ways.  In 1946, Konrad Adenauer observed that the bishops should have spoken out against Hilter - which they actually did, repeatedly - which grew out of a view of the Church as moral advocate.Despite what we feel are its manifest failings. The ""perfect society"" view gave Catholics a belief that the Church was divinely established and superior to the NS state. It also generated a sense of solidarity among Catholics in the face of Nazi persecution (as it had done 60 years before, during the Kulturkampf.) (p. 159.) The organizational strength of the church was demonstrated by the distribution of Mit Brenennder Sorge and by the distribution of Bishop Galen's sermons condemning euthanasia in 1941. (p. 159.) The church continued to function in 1945 as the only organization capable of distributing food and clothes. (Id.) But this attitude also fostered an insularity, such that Catholics did not look beyond their own circles toward what was happening to the jews.

"This had a surprisingly good cast.  I was pleased to see Jeff Fahey, and Ed Quinn (from Eureka) and Brad Furlong, who seemed like big names for such a low budget flick.  The music was very progressive and provided a nice cerebral and introspective back drop for the movie.The story however seemed very cliche without much to hold one's attention and not much of an ending.  There are seven people trapped in a building. Outside it is always light.  There are ""things"" out there that are dangerous.  We never see the things. Jack (Quinn) is the leader with a shotgun, who wanders around the building having flashbacks.  The rest are characters with their own neuroses. Characters disappear or stuff. Eventually one is left.  No explanation is provided for why only Jack sees Noah (Furlong).  Turns out the whole thing is....well, you can figure it out.  Your first guess is probably right, although a twist at the end, rather than the usual ""they were trying to reach closure on their life"" would have been better.Not a bad movie. Not a great movie.

"Franz Jagerstatter was a Catholic Austrian farmer who graduated from a one-room school at fourteen.  He spent some time working in the mines before returning to his home-town of St. Radegund. At St. Radegund he fathered a child out of wedlock and then married Franziska Schaninger and started farming.  The couple had two small children and Franz grew deeper in his Catholic faith.  In 1938, Austria was incorporated into the National Socialist (NS) German Reich, initially by force and then by a plebiscite.From 1940 to 1941, Franz was inducted into the Austrian army, where he was trained as a soldier away from St. Radegund.  During that time, he wrote letters to wife.  These letters are beautiful expressions of the love of a man for his wife and family. Franz also offers the perspective of an Austrian peasant on his times, his faith and on the NS influence on Austria.  These letters are particularly poignant because we know Franz's destiny.After he was mustered out of training in 1941, Franz returned to St. Radegund, where he thought about the NS and what it meant to be complicit in NS evil. In 1943, Franz was recalled to military service.  The NS was an evil condemned by the Catholic Church.  Bishops and priests were arrested and imprisoned for speaking against the NS. Service in the military was service to evil, but Franz had a family and not serving was disobedience to the State, and to God who ordained the State, and was punishable by death. Soldiers were dying in the East for an evil cause, and while military service was less risky than a  predestined execution by guillotine, death in such service would be a violation of conscience, which could merit eternal loss.Franz was impaled on the cruelest dilemma devised by humanity: be true to his conscience and die, a death that would jeopardize his family; or be false to his conscience and court damnation.The uneducated Austrian farmer pondered his moral situation and made his decision.  He would report for military service and refuse to take the oath to Hitler.  Having made this decision, he reported for military service, refused to take the oath, was interrogated repeatedly, was advised by priest and family that his death would be loss to his wife and his two small children, who he dearly loved. But he remained true to his conscience, and on August 9, 1943, Franz was executed by beheading by guillotine, an unknown and unremarked martyr.His memory was recaptured by the publication of a book - In Solitary Witness by Gordon Zahn - in the 1960s and on October 26, 2007, Franz Jagerstatter was beatified by Pope Benedict at the Linz Cathedral at a mass attended by his wife and children, who had been denied a pension after the war because of Blessed Fran's wartime refusal to serve in the NS army.The story is quite simply remarkable.  I am interested in the history disclosed by the story in the subtext, but, first, I have to point out that Blessed Franz's writing is beautiful and his practical theologizing is simply profound.  Pre-postmodern culture did a good job of teaching grammar and rhetoric and the practical contents of knowledge.  One can marvel at the lucidity of the prose of this man who dropped out at equivalent of the Ninth grade when compared to the poor quality of writing and reflection turned out by college graduates.One also notes how much Catholicism played in Bl. Franz's life and reflections.  I had not heard of him until I happened upon him while reading Robert Krieg's Catholic Theologians in Nazi Germany. I don't think many have or Bl. Franz's memory would be gracing the pages of anti-Catholic books who like to showcase ""good Catholics"" like Deacon Lichtenberg and Father Maximillian Kolbe.  Of course, Bl. Franz's unredeemed Catholicism is a problem. As stated in the Introduction by Jim Forest: ""Franz Jagestatter remains a challenge, and not only because of his costly refusal to surrender his conscience to the Nazis. One aspect of that challenge is Franz's deeply traditional faith, an example far from fashionable today even among Catholics. While certainly not unaware of the church's human shortcomings and the ways so many bishops compromise the Gospel in order to be on good terms with political leaders. Franz Jagerstatter was a grateful Catholic committed to the church and its sacramental and devotional life."" (p. xxvii).  Of course, it does not occur to the introduction to think that perhaps - just perhaps - it was Franz's sacramental life that assisted him in his decision and his life.One ""counter-intuitive"" aspect of Bl. Franz's letters is how many priests were arrested and imprisoned for anti-NS activities as part of their pastoral activities.  Hence, Bl Franz refers to Father Josef Lindinger who criticized the NS in 1938, whereupon the NS broke the windows on his rectory and forced him to resign. (p. 37.) Father Karobath, the priest at St. Radegund, was arrested and imprisoned for criticizing the NS. (p. 248.) Father Leopold Arthofer was imprisoned in Dachau from April 4, 1941 to April 4, 1945. (p. 247.) Another pastor after having his sermon reported by a midwife to a teacher received a rebuke from the NS for preaching that parents should send their children to Mass on holy Days. (p. 44). Father Gebetsberger was arrested in February of 1940 and imprisoned for 6 months because of his criticism of NS. (p. 73.) Despite making a big contribution to the NS, the hofbauer family had their Gasthaus shut down because their son Pastor Johann (""Pleikner"") Hofbauer had publicly criticized the NS. (p. 92.) In prison, awaiting execution, Bl. Franz was by a Tyrolean priest, Franz Reinisch, a priest of the Pallotine order, whom the Reich had executed on August 21, 1942 because of his refusal to take the military oath, a revelation that gave Franz consolation as he awaited execution. (p. 125.)Bl. Franz's experience made him express regret that priests and bishops were not critical of the NS after the 1938 Anschluss, but he acknowledged the risk to them in speaking their true minds.  He also noted that they had not been given the same grace he had been given in his willingness to die for his faith and conscience.Franz deduced his moral obligation from Catholic teaching.  He notes than when it was free to do so, the Austrian Catholic church condemned the Nazi.  He also knows that the Pope had condemned National Socialism (in Mit Brennender Sorge), and he knew that teaching had never been countermanded, so he understood the silence of his priests and bishops as part of that condemnation.""If it were only a war about land as so many others have been and if Germany were actually to end up as the victor, then Catholics at the end of this war would possess the same rights as every other citizen in the German Reich.  But if this war is in fact a revolution or a conflict about religious belief, then I could fight for the N.S. Reich as much as I want and yet I - despite all of the exertions and sacrifice that I as a poor soldier had offered - would be seen t the war's end to be an enemy of the Reich because I a Catholic would still not commit myself to National Socialism. In other words, I would be seen at the war's end as Austrian Christians are seen today, even though they submitted themselves - not freely - four years ago to the National Socialist.These thoughts alone suffice for someone not to fight for this state or for the NS Volk community. Further, I believe that many people have forgotten what the Holy Father said bout National Socialism in his encyclical many years ago, namely that National Socialism is even more dangerous than Communism. Since Rome has not withdrawn this judgment, I believe that it is not likely a crime or a sin if someone as a Catholic were to refuse the current obligation for military service - even though a person who refuses military service is surely looking at death.  Is it not more Christian for someone to give himself as a sacrifice than to have to murder others who possess a right to life on earth and who want to live in order to save their lives for a short while."" (p. 190.)I have read so many books written since Hochhuth's slanderous ""The Deputy"" that take it as given that Pius was silent because of his (irrational) (overstated) fear of Bolshevism.  But that is not what one Austrian farmer understood living in the mix of history with his life on the line.  So, where did Bl. Franz get this insight if it wasn't what was understood at the time? (Which it was.)Here is an extended passage on the catechism of silence:""On one occasion, someone told me that we can belong to the NS Party or contribute to the Winter Help Work without giving the matter any further thought. This person said it makes entirely no difference if we engage in these activities because Rome has canceled its ban [against membership in the NS Party]. However, I did not believe this answer, and so I inquired further into this matter with a higher religion authority.  He told me that the first answer was not true because Rome has still not made a decision about [National Socialism] in general.I believe that it is pointless to ask priests about this matter. First, they have no more specific instructions from higher church officials.  Second, if a priest were to say something different from what the N.S. Party holds and if he himself were betrayed, we know what would happen to him. Third, it can also be that priests themselves are not clear about the entire matter.During a retreat a priest who is a member of a religious order said that many parents come to him with questions about their children. He said further that these parents themselves should already know what they have to do. He acknowledged the difficult situation in which many parents today find themselves when their consciences tell them something different from what the party says.  Everyone knows that to decide against the party's wishes is likely to jeopardize one's livelihood.It would perhaps be better if the church were not to make a decision in this matter, for many people would not be able to go against the party despite an ecclesiastical judgment. These people know that with one blow their entire life would be ruined. Moreover, as long as the church has not made a definite decision in this matter, accountability before God for many people will not be so difficult.All of us who were educated in the Catholic religion know that we are not allowed to participate in political parties that are enemies of the church or to contribute to such parties so that they can have a wider influence.  My conscience has much to say about all of this.  I believe that if people have a full recognition that this political party that they are joining or have joined or to which they have contributed is an opponent of the church and if these people continue to it so that they obtain earthly advantages, then they may find themselves facing eternal disadvantages.We should not, of course, pass judgment on others when they participate in this or that, make contributions or engage in NS fund-raising.  We do not know whether they have a full recognition that the party to which they belong is an opponent of the church. Or if they know this, they may not know that belonging to such a party is not allowed by the Catholic Church. There are also many people who even believe that to contribute to the NS Party is a Christian act."" (p. 195 - 196.)Elsewhere he wrote:""It does not even belong to us to condemn either the National Socialists as a group or as individuals. But as Catholics we must condemn and reject the NS convictiosn and the ideas of those epopel who believe that we are not able to become fortunate on this earth through the teachings of Christ. It is a certain sign that such people know too little about the Christian faith. Because our faith offers so much, we shall become fortunate through it not only in eternal life but already her in this world. So We Catholics have not the least reason to allow our faith to get somehow combined with other teachings.The Catholic Church has not yet declared that the NS Party is an opponent of the church and hence has not said that it forbids, Catholics, under the pain of sin, from belonging to the party.  The church has remained silent on this matter. Nevertheless we surely know what this party is and how it stands in relation to the church. Many Austrians will be able to remember the words of the Holy Father in the encyclical that came to our ears as drastic changes were occurring in Austria: that the National Socialist danger is as dangerous for us as the Communist danger. ""(p. 202.)Franz sneered at the NS insistence on being a part of a ""Volk community."" (p. 24.) At one point he writes to his wife: ""these are the purest of Volk treks.  They are worthless endeavors in which we simply march down a road."" (p. 65.) The Nazis taught their soldiers that ""all of us should help one another"" but that the NS would not insert their mentality into him. (p. 72.)The enforced silence on the Church was part of Bl. Franz's suffering. He writes:""Have the National Socialists now - after more than two years of bringing about the horrible murder of people - adopted a new orientation that would allow and even promote the silence of church officials? Have church officials reached the decision that it is now permissible for Catholics to belong to a party that opposes the church? Have they given a positive evaluation of National Socialism."" (p. 174.)It is clear that he understands that the answer is ""no,"" but he questions whether it would have been better for the Austrian Church to have had martyrs as examples.  And, yet, he does not mean to throw stones at our bishops and priests.  They are humans of flesh and blood as we are and they can be weak."" (p. 175.) (He also speculates that the bishops might have expected a quick fall of the Nazi government, which survived against all expectations.(Id.)Bl. Franz was also able to make sense out of his own suffering by his faith.  There are some moving passages where he meditates on the meaning of suffering and the cross he must bear in being faithful to Christ.  This is heady stuff today where the default ""heroic"" position is for the hero of a story to inveigh against God for being so cruel.  Franz does not doubt the mercy of God and he recognizes who the enemy is, namely National Socialism.  Franz does not blame the Nazis individually. (P. 199 (""while I have surely pounded hard against National Socialism, I am not permitted to attack National Socialists. To do so would go against the commandment concerning love of neighbors. We should condemn the NS views or convictions but not the people who hold these convictions. It belongs to God alone to judge people and to condemn them. All of us are brothers and sisters before God."")Unlike modern commenters who are befuddled by an obvious truth, Bl. Franz had no doubt that the Reich was the enemy of the Church. During his interrogation, Bl Franz learned the following:""This morning a man whose father is a general told me that someone in a position higher than a general has said: ""One must first fight against our enemies outside and afterward against our enemy inside, namely the C[hurch]."""" (p. 108.)Franz's meditations on bible verses and the Our Father are moving for their simplicity and clarity.  This is a book that deserves to be read as both inspirational material and a kind of practical guide for living in morally compromised times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U02WP0YUD8P2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1570758263#wasThisHelpful","R2U02WP0YUD8P2","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an engaging and delightful read, notwithstanding the fact that it plays out all the tropes of the genre.Dan Faust is a wizard, who lives in Las Vegas and uses playing cards as the vehicle of his magic.  He is a bit of a free-lance private detective, who gets involved in the death of a runaway.  He investigates and finds her mutilated soul. He investigates further and discovers a porn producer who has a pet demon. One thing leads to another and he is fighting for the fate of the world.We get a view of the world that Dan Faust inhabits. There is a loosely knit occult underground, half-breed demons are gangsters and low-life, and the demons have a byzantine political system. Faust has good relationship with his fellow members of the ""occult underground,"" who are like family and do their own unique magical stuff in their own unique way. The rules are out there and people seem to know them. The good guys are really nice, although we have to stipulate that they are damaged and dangerous and not the good guys, while they go on doing the nice things they do.Dan Faust's Las Vegas might, for all we know, be in the same universe as Harry Dresden's Chicago, albeit in Dresden's world the demon half-breeds are ""Hellions"" and in Las Vegas they are ""Cambions.""The story moved along at a good clip, revealing clues, giving pay-offs, setting up the next level of the onion skin of the mystery. The writing was professional and proficient. I was hooked and interested throughout the story, for which I am grateful. The one nit I would pick is the relationship with the demon; what is the point of setting up a demon as an ur-force of unfathomable evil in order to turn her into the ideal girlfriend?  Yes, of course, this is as standard trope, but it seemed like a clunker to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R396MQ73VX2PBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990339319#wasThisHelpful","R396MQ73VX2PBZ","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me the attraction of this story is that it was written by Stanley G. Weinbaum.  Weinbaum wrote ""The Martian Odyssey"" in 1932, which was a story about 20 years ahead of its time in terms of plot, character and theme. The Martian Odyssey just doesn't seem like it was written so early in the history of science fiction.  Weinbaum was born in 1902 and died in 1935, eighteen months after the publication of his first story, which was The Martian Odyssey.I've only read The Martian Odyssey, so I was interested in this story, which was published in Amazing Stories in 1938, obviously posthumously.  It isn't clear to me that the story wasn't ""polished"" up by another write.  I note that the antagonist seems patterned on Huey Long.  I guess during 1934/1935, Long was a feature of the stories of the time and a projection into the future might have involved a Long-like politician and traces of Hitler as well, in the ""Roman salutes"" that the Secret Service is always throwing at the president.The story is not inspired. The title sets the story in 1950, but the story mentions the election of 1958 in the past that put President Steel Jeffers in power.  It took some time for Jeffers to consolidate power and put the army in black and institute the ""Roman salute,"" so maybe this set in the 1960s.  The hero is Secret Service agent Lt. Jack Adams, who is part of a cabal to unseat the dictator.  The problem is that Adams sort of likes the liberal and charismatic Steel Jeffers and has a surprisingly strong hankering for the president's mysteriously disappeared sister.  There is a McGuffin that makes up the heart of the story, but I'm not going to share it for obvious reasons.  In truth, the McGuffin is rather tame - although in 1934 it may have been the cat's pajama - and not worth the pay-off. The science in the story revolves around the McGuffin.  I suspected it half-way through the story.The story is rather pedestrian.  It is kind of interesting from the standpoint of showing what people thought of America in the 1930s. A fascist take-over, which doesn't seem particularly traumatic. Yes, people are being executed for being subversives, but there are still independent governors and some independent congressmen, and it seems that Steel Jeffers may be making the trains run on time.I generally liked the story, but it wasn't something I'd particularly remember or find interesting if it lacked the Weinbaum angle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13NF3IG9D2L5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WOJEGAK#wasThisHelpful","R13NF3IG9D2L5K","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I rented this movie I imagined that it would feature Arnold Schwarzenegger smashing his way through a zombie-apocalyptic landscape, desperately trying to get his daughter to the last place with a cure for her.That might have been a good movie.  Over the top, but good.This is not that movie.In this movie, it seems that there is a necro-ambulatory virus that has caused a great deal of suffering.  Society is still organized, but the problem is that the virus takes weeks to turn its victims into, well, zombies. So, the problem is, what do you do with the victims while they are turning and after they turn.Arnold has to struggle with this question when his beloved daughter is bit by a zombie. More important, his daughter has to deal with the same problem as she watches the disease grow in her body and she knows that she will be confined to ""Quarantine"" with other brainless and vicious devolved human wrecks.This is really a disease movie.  It could have been about cancer or senility, it just happens to be about zombieism and the terror of infection and assault.It is a decent movie. The acting is excellent, but it is slow and somber. It also inverts the ""fun"" of zombie movies, which seems to be the license of its characters to commit mass murder in self-defense against hordes of ""orcs"", innocent of the fact that these are human beings with a disease.  The ""Walking Dead"" was able to inspire that sense in its early years, and probably managed it better than ""Maggie.""  However, for a change of pace, if you are not expecting adventure and heroics, this is not a bad movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CBS6K7NL3QUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBTJC10#wasThisHelpful","R1CBS6K7NL3QUR","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of the Nightside are waiting for Simon Green to strike fire with another series like the Nightside. This story might be the start of that series.Green introduces us to Ishmael Jones, who is a dangerous man, but oddly youthful and polite and urbane. Jones had been working for a secret organization that terminates aliens with extreme prejudice when he was recruited by the Colonel. That was 15 years ago, and now Jones has gotten an oddly frantic call from the Colonel to come to the Colonel's family residence immediately.  Jones heads to the residence, but is too late; the Colonel has been murdered and an epic snow storm has sealed off the inhabits of the rustic, aristocratic home from the rest of the world, and the murders continue.I was intrigued to learn about Jones. What was his deal? Why was he so dangerous?  Why did he seem to be the same age over the span of 60 years? I was thinking ""vampire""...but whether I'm right or wrong, you will have to read the story.Likewise, I was fascinated by the nature of the murderer, although Jones figures it out quite handily.The book was a fun, quick read. We were introduced to Jones, and a little bit of his backstory, and he acquired a female love/partner, and so is positioned to make the drive into serial status.This is not the Nightside.  The Nightside was a fascinating locale with zany, two-dimensional characters who run on stage and off stage as needed. This book was more self-consciously a mystery with supernatural overtones.  It worked well as a story, but it did not have the element of zany abandonment that made the Nightside so memorable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IODEU5M3PKP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0727883887#wasThisHelpful","R2IODEU5M3PKP0","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my review of the final Avery Cates book - The Final Evolution (Avery Cates) - I wondered whether that was the final book. Jeff Somers hadn't answered many of the questions that he had set up for himself in the wild ride of Avery Cates through the meltdown of the human race.Well, it turns out that Avery Cates is unkillable as much as a genre figure as he is in his books and this is the second post-series story. In the first, Cates was hijacked into a forgotten, dilapidated prison run by a psychotic telekinetic. Cates obviously made his way out of that inescapable prison with extreme prejudice to anyone who opposed him.In that case, it wasn't clear when the story was set.  It seemed like a long time after the events of The Final Evolution, perhaps decades. This story is set shortly after the events of the prior story.  In this story, Cates spies a small human settlement, which he decides to investigate, which leads to trouble, which leads to a hint that someone is looking for him. Perhaps this person or persons have answers to what happened to everything?These are fun stories. However, if you start with this one without knowing who Cates is, or why you should care about him, you will be disappointed and, perhaps, frustrated at getting a soupcon of a story, when you might have thought that you were getting a full course. So, forewarned is forearmed: start with an earlier story, preferably the first story, and I don't think you will be disappointed with reading about the rise and fall of the world's most unkillable villain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36YLL35UU3H88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XPU1HI6#wasThisHelpful","R36YLL35UU3H88","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was almost always something to watch. The clockwork mechanics of the CGI effects and their sumptuous color palate was visually fascinating.  Some of the scenes, such as the starship pulling up through the rings of Saturn were enough to make an old time science fiction reader feel like their imagination have finally come to life.Unfortunately, the plotline was convoluted, Byzantine and incomprehensible. Apparently, the title character is really the ""Queen"" of something - a trading empire? a corporation? who knows? - because of her genetic composition.  As such she has the right to ""own the Earth"" and prevent the son of the previous Queen from ""harvesting"" the planet to make the bath oil that lets people live to 9,000 years old without getting any wiser. There is a galactic bureaucracy, some kind of ""Legion,"" various animal-hybrid aliens and lots of clockwork nanotechnology. A flowchart of who is who would help.Mila Kunis's character - Jupiter - is basically Cinderella, a decent, poor chargirl who is about to lifted out of obscurity.  So maybe it is Cinderella meets Oliver Twist, without Fagin, but with a wolf-human hybrid with magic boots that no one thinks of taking from him when they put him in prison or toss him into space.So, to that extent, it may be more of a fit for the romantic YA market than the hard-boiled Space Epic crowd.I gave it a three for trying so darn hard, but I am somewhere between a two and a three as a die-hard science fiction fan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WEL2IVZU2DIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9DLEZY#wasThisHelpful","R1WEL2IVZU2DIK","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Humanity is in a bad way.  The sun started flaring in in 2044, wiping out 97.5% of humanity. The remaining population lives in walled in cities, avoiding the wasteland that the Earth has become.But we have robots with something approaching AI to do our dirty work for us.  Fortunately, they are hedged by two ""principles"" - don't allow any harm to come to any living thing and don't self-repair.  Once robots start to self-repair, then, presumably, evolution might kick in and it would be curtains for what remains of humanity.Antonio Banderas is an insurance investigator for the company that makes the robots.  He knows his game, but he wants to take his pregnant wife, leave the city and go to the ocean. Then, a very scruffy Dylan McDermott discovers a robot self-repairing and seeming to be ....alive.  Banderas is sent off by this to find the mysterious ""watchmaker"" who may be trying to knock humanity down a notch as the leading edge of evolution.This movie has nice visuals, a seedy city and an arid wasteland. The actors are good.  The plot moves along, with its subtext of ""what is alive?"" and ""would it really be so bad if a better version of humanity took over?""  In some ways, I was attracted by the robots who seemed to be channeling Ghandi in their passive disobedience/obedience to the first principle; the humans, on the other hand, seemed pretty loathsome. Also, some scenes made me wonder whether the robots weren't about to create their own religious/ethical system  If this were a novella, I would expect a sequel set in a post-human world.Since it is not a slam-bang, explosion-filled chase adventure, it probably will seem slow to some viewers.  There are some moments of excitement and action, but not many. Also, some things are left relatively unexplained; I understand the cockroach robot is a self-replicating robot, but is it the next generation? the robot protectors? their pets?This is an interesting movie.  If you want a more cerebral science fiction flick, this is not bad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32V8M2IY8SNQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCEDVW4#wasThisHelpful","R32V8M2IY8SNQE","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You could tell yourself what bets to place on dog races, what things to avoid, the nasty things your friends intend to do to you, but all that might be subject to misinterpretation. It is, after all, just a polaroid.And what would happen to free will?This movie takes the premise of the future polaroid and runs with it.  We are introduced to three roommates, Jasper, Finn and Callie, who discover that their now-dead neighbor has been taking picture of them. They work out that these were future pictures, and then the moral dilemmas ensue.  Should they use the camera for self-gain? Should they tell the authorities about the dead neighbor? What should they do when the local mobster gets suspicious about Jasper's unprecedented winning streak?  Can they even change what they see in the pictures?The story works as kind of a mystery as the trio attempt to decipher the clues from the pictures.  It is also a morality tale as they become more and more corrupted by this limited form of omniscience. Some of the plot developments were easily spotted by science fiction fans, some of the plot developments were kept will hidden.

The acting was great, the writing was superb, and the situations brilliantly flowed from the premise. The best part of the movie was when the vampires' self-perceptions of youth, sexiness and uber-coolness were confronted by reality.Actually, the best part was when Stu explained his job as an IT technician to a crowd of vampires, who immediately sensed from his job description that he must be a ""virgin,"" which created a scene because, you know, virgin blood is particularly prized by the deceased-New Zealand community.Or the part with ""Werewolves, not Swearwolves.""I wouldn't say that the movie was thigh-slapping, but it was light-hearted and elicited a fair number of guffaws.

"I fondly remembered reading this book as teenager approximately 40 years ago. I remember the fantastic world described by the author, Brian W. Aldiss, a world where animals have died out, replaced by vegetable creatures, who have evolved to exploit every available niche in a world where the sun has grown old and enlarged and is pouring out energy on a world that has become a fantastic ""hothouse.""  This was an amazing and captivating world made only more amazing and captivating by the fact that this world was our planet, two billion years in the future, in the ""long afternoon"" of the Earth.I particularly remembered the imagery of the Earth becoming tidally locked with the Moon so that only one side faced eternally to the sun, and that a vegetable life had evolved into immense spiders that traversed between Earth and Moon on spider silk, such that the Earth in its old age was enmeshed in cobwebs.  It is an image that stayed with me for decades.Unfortunately, on my adult re-reading, I was surprised to find how shallow the book was.  The first part of the book was captivating as we were shown the crazy world of evolved and highly dangerous plant life, and how the species of animals had declined to ""termights"" and ants and wasps and bees and humans.  We are introduced to a tribe of humans who inhabit this strange world.  A child of the tribe is casually killed which causes the tribe to split up, the older elements of the tribe making a trip to the Moon on the traversers to make a kind of evolution, while the other part of the tribe has its own adventure.  We follow the younger element as they are carried from one strange part of this world to another, while tribe members die at an alarming rate. Gren, the oldest male member of the remaining tribe, becomes the focal point of the story and we follow him as he mostly messes up.  He becomes possessed of an intelligent fungus, who plumbs his racial memories and increases his intelligence. We learn that humans have devolved to tarsier-like beings of limited intelligence, and, in fact, it was a symbiosis that led to human beings having intelligence in the first place.  We follow Gren as he creates a family and is driven to the shadowy area of the Earth and learns more about the planet and the fate it will soon experience.The book in fact reads like a young adult adventure, with the romance.  What was disappointing for me was the shallowness of the characterization and writing. There were some great ideas here - the evolution of plant life, the winding down of the planet - but so much was left for the willing suspension of disbelief.  For example, how long would it take for the Traveler beasts to go from Earth to Moon? Too long, one would think, to allow human beings to catch a ride.  What about the tidal lock that fixes one side of the Earth permanently to the Sun? Wouldn't there be constant, titanic hurricanes that would render the Earth inhabitable?  Obviously, fleshing out this world with its fascinating setting is not Aldiss's interest.Likewise, there probably is only so much characterization that can be done with tarsier-level intelligence, but the characters' dialogue was wooden and stilted, and the introduction of the  ""tummy-belly"" people - and here Aldiss seems to have predicted the ""Teletubbies"" forty years before the fact - was just annoying in its cuteness.  Likewise, what was with the ""Heckler"" device discovered in a ruin.  It is supposedly two billion years in the future and something that seems to come from the 21st century has survived? Another nit I found with the writing was that the dialogue shouts out the stupidity of this people, and, yet, they will casually drop in college words, such as evolution.  And, finally, the nifty core of the book I remembered was that the reason for this weird world was the arms-race of evolution.  All that goes out the window at the end, with hand-waiving about metaphysics.This book won the 1962 Hugo Award, so my disappointing re-read is all the more disappointing.  I can see how enrapturing the setting could be, but, frankly, I found Alan Dean Foster's Mid-World to be better written with the same setting.  Perhaps there was an evolution in writing during the 1960s? Since I have been critical of some of the current contenders for the Hugo Award in 2015, it is good to know that not every book written in the past was a model of writing.I am not recommending against this book.  It is a Hugo winner. You should read it.  Better still give it to your teen or pre-teen and kindle a sense of wonder in them.I am giving this one a four star rating - three stars for my matured appraisal and another one for what it meant to me when I was a teenager.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B17NTWJ3N127/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7I1AU8#wasThisHelpful","R2B17NTWJ3N127","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been working my way through the history of the Nazi-Catholic relationship relationship prior to World War II.  I thought that Inhumanities might offer some insight into this project.  It really didn't and on the whole I didn't find it useful to my research, but, nonetheless, the approach taken by the Author David B. Dennis was enlightening.  In essence Dennis reveals what an encyclopedic reading of the contemporary texts available to the German people, in this case, the Volkische Beobachter, can teach us about the cognitive world that Germans lived in.Books written in the last last 40 years tend to underplay the role played by German propaganda and the messages repeated by major German publications like the Volkische Beobachter.  Modern readers forget the significance of the Beobachter:""By the time of the war, the Vlkischer Beobachter had become the first German newspaper with a circulation of more than 1 million. From 1923 until 1938, Alfred Rosenberg served as the editor-in-chief;13 thereafter he was replaced by Wilhelm Weiss through 1945.14 But whether under Rosenberg's or Weiss' leadership, the paper was always Hitler's primary publicity organ.""Inhumanities by David B. Dennis has as its project the analysis of the National Socialist treatment of the humanities. Dennis approaches his project by an encyclopedic reading of the Volkische Beobacther - the Nazi official newspaper owned, controlled and published by Alfred Rosenberg. The Volkische Beobachter regularly included an ""Arts and Literature"" section, and through the vehicle of this section, Rosenberg and the writers the Beobachter employed recast literature and arts in a way that cast the classics of German Art and Literature as proto-Nazis or German nationalists before Germany was a nation. The purpose was to give National Socialism a pedigree and some intellectual weight to go with its pretensions of being the authentic German nation.  The approach was propaganda:""Reviewing the constant repetition of these themes via ongoing references to the major figures of Western culture can be trying. But it was precisely by way of incessant reiteration that these ""principles"" were intended to appear ""unshakeable"" (unerschtterlich) and ""binding"" (bindend) to the newspaper's readers. As Hitler put it in Mein Kampf: ""effective propaganda must be limited to a very few points and must harp on these in slogans until the last member of the public understands what you want him to understand.""The reader is given a tour of almost everything in the National Socialist attempt to make the past National Socialist. Some of it is weird, such as Shakespeare:""Nazi admiration for Shakespeare extended to including him in the Valhalla of Nordic creators. Marking a Shakespeare week in 1927, Baldur von Schirach - future head of the Hitler Youth, but then a student of Germanistik and Art History at the University of Munich who contributed regularly to the newspaper22 - also referred to Shakespeare (1564-1616) as a Nordic genius...""Other times, there is the amazing concern over whether a great German genius is Jewish. Other times, ""bad"" German geniuses simply get dubbed Jewish.Wagner, of course, was the hot burning sun of the Nazi humanities program:""Major figures who were regularly invoked included Luther, Drer, Rembrandt, Shakespeare, Bach, Mozart, Schiller, Goethe, and Beethoven. In many of these sections, the culminating example was Richard Wagner. Records of Wagner reception in the Vlkischer Beobachter confirm the composer's enormous stature in National Socialist culture: few themes were addressed in the paper without some accompanying reference to Wagner's supposedly supportive views on the matter.""Interestingly, Nietzsche was not THE German philosopher for the Beobachter:""In search of ""Nordic existentialism,"" the paper celebrated Sren Kierkegaard, but its reception of Friedrich Nietzsche wavered, ultimately implying that he just missed becoming ""The Nazi Philosopher"" because he did not quite grasp the seriousness of the Jewish threat.""Schopenhauer may have been favored because he was an antisemite.""As discussed below, the Vlkischer Beobachter made more use of Schopenhauer's anti-Semitic views in particular. Here, though, we see how careful selections from his writings were exploited to align the philosopher with the newspaper's political aims, here anti-British.""Luther was pressed into service as both an antisemite and an anti-Catholic:""Throughout its coverage, the paper followed a nationalistic line expressed by Wilhelm Frick, the Nazi Minister of the Interior, at Wittenberg on the 450th anniversary of Luther's birth in 1933: Luther had become a ""global force,"" but only because he was ""German with every fiber of his heart and every vibration of his soul: `I was born for my Germans, I will serve them' - these were his words; this is what he meant.""16By concentrating on and reproducing Luther's strongest statements from ""Against the Papacy in Rome,""17 the Vlkischer Beobachter articulated a tendency to construe Luther's message as wholly German, even to the point of distinguishing Lutheranism from the Judeo-Christian tradition. With ""clarity that could not be misunderstood,"" wrote Adolf Hsel, Luther challenged faith in the infallibility of the Pope: he turned against the ""Devil's work"" of idolatry, the sale of indulgences, and other abuses by the Catholic Church. But most importantly, for Hsel, Luther's actions constituted a ""call for the Nordic peoples of Europe to shake off the curse of racially foreign spirituality that had weighed upon them since the outbreak of Roman Christianity, and to follow the formation of their inner relations to God in their own way.""Voltaire presented a problem:""In addition, the paper took issue with Voltaire's ""unconscionably hypocritical"" dealings with the French Catholic Church. Cultural history had ""rarely seen such a coward"" as Voltaire, said the paper: he could hardly take pen in hand without writing something malicious about the Church. But ""when he thought about it afterward, sweat of fear broke out on his forehead since the powerful opponent might seek revenge, so he made all his friends swear on their lives that they would not reveal him as the author."" It was ""shameful"" to see how ""he, who did so much to destroy Catholic authority, so cravenly assured the Academy that there was no better Catholic than him - only because he vainly longed for a seat in that body."" Moreover, before his death - just because he was afraid of being buried in unconsecrated soil - ""the sworn enemy of Catholic dogma confessed."" By the same token, however, to the extent that Vlkischer Beobachter reception of Voltaire was positive, it was mostly due to his stand against the Church: ""that people today can pray to God according to their own hearts is largely thanks to Voltaire."" Therefore, the paper admitted, ""despite the confusing combination of so many weaknesses and so many virtues, his impact on posterity could not be overlooked.""And the essential nationalism of National Socialism was found in its appropriation of Luther:""""Luther's Dream is Our Goal,"" headlined an article wherein the Vlkischer Beobachter emphatically asserted that Nazi history flowed from Luther to Hitler. At a time when the suffering Volk had longed for a word from God, Luther became the ""word leader,"" ""showing the direction and providing the solution."" Luther's significance lay in his ""Fhrertum"": his love for the Volk gave him ""almost superhuman strength to defy the whole world, the Emperor, and the Pope."" He headed a spiritual movement that could only be compared with the ""great experience of the Nazi Revolution."" It was not Luther's fault that the ""great start toward self-consciousness in the Volk,"" a goal for which Nazis were still struggling, had faded out in the eighteenth century. Only the Prussian state took the message of the ""political Luther"" as its own and began to unify the nation, though even Bismarck could not fully form it.""The writing is dry and approaching the book is like taking a sip from a fire hydrant. A good amount of the analysis requires an in-depth knowledge of music, art and literary history.  This book is more appropriate for specialists - despite the enticing cover - but for as an amateur, I found the idea of reading the Volkischer Beobachter as a primary source worth the price of administration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J1HM392OFIT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AB9MKO#wasThisHelpful","R1J1HM392OFIT8","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It seems that those souls who don't go to Heaven or Hell go to this city to leave out lives of quiet desperation in a bleak, smelly, dirty and smoggy city to eke out an existence selling and buying drugs and engaging in prostitution.  What else the economy of the city is based on is unexplained, and, frankly, unimaginable.  We don't see into the lives of the average person; so do they know that they lived a previous life on Earth?  Best not to let these kinds of speculation enter the universe; the city is a prop to create an attitude of leather-wearing, decadent nihilism.The McGuffin is that 7 demons in human form and 7 angels in human form are to battle for the destiny of the city.  This is explained in the prologue, so at least the rules of the game are laid out clearly.  Evil has been doing very well and has either killed 6 of the angels or driven them underground. The 7 demons are rug-chewingly evil, including Samael, who, at times, does a good imitation Vigo Mortenson's characterization of Satan from the Prophecy.  Guns and knives are used to dispatch the demons, frequently in a ballet of shooting and kung fu that reminded me of scenes from Equilibrium.Eventually, there is an ending where forgiveness and love seem to make all the difference, but after all the fighting, just when there ought to be a victory dinner that recognizes the dead angels Who Gave Their Last  for the cause, Gabriel looks up and yells at God for the meaninglessness of it all.Huh?  Now, it dawns on him that maybe they didn't need to fight?  They could have resolved the whole thing with a rousing game of Monopoly?Chalk that up to the post-modern impulse that seems to have to put God in the Dock for everything - we want our rousing story, but if we are post-modern artists, we also have to have our post-modern moment of venting our unhappiness at our ""Daddy Issues.""Nonetheless, fun story, good acting by the lead, and don't think too much about the logic of the backstory.That way lies madness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TFCOKRTNW8DK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B80EM4#wasThisHelpful","R3TFCOKRTNW8DK","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a film made by Fritz Lang based on a script written by Bertold Brecht and Fritz Lang, starring a somewhat young Walter Brennan, at least Brennan was younger than when he played in the Cowboy television shows I remember him from.This movie is a fictionalized account of the murder of SS Reichsprotector Reinhardt Heydrich and the reprisal murder of hostages in Occupied Czechoslovakia.  This movie was made in 1943, about 6 months after the assassination, and seems to be function as both anti-Nazi propaganda and a drama.There are bits that seems strange. For example, I watched the first 6 minutes about three times to see how I missed the important bit where Heydrich is killed.  It turns out that I didn't miss it, at all, it wasn't in the film.  The film transitions from Heydrich playing the typical bullying Nazi, to driving off in his car, to our hero walking away from the assassination, which has already happened. Heydrich's assassination is purely off-stage. I suspect this was because the filmmakers knew that Heydrich had been killed, but didn't know how.  In any event, they make the assassin, a lone Communist-affiliated doctor, rather than a team of British agents parachuted into Czechoslovakia.Thereafter, the movie is a melodramatic cat and mouse story about how the assassin involves a Czek woman, and how hostages are taken, and how the resistance mounts a cagey fraud to frame a Nazi collaborator. In between, there are stirring calls to patriotism and depictions of Nazi beastliness.The historical Communist angle is interesting as well.  I take it that it is no surprise that Brecht would make the hero someone who is affiliated with the Communists, although, frankly, the fact that this is a Communist cell is only hinted at.  On the other hand, it was interesting to recognize one of the actors - the cab driver - from his trademark gravelly voice as Lionel Stander, who played ""Max"" the driver on ""Hart to Hart.""  A quick internet search turned up the fact that Stander actually was a Communist who had been unmasked by the HUAC in the 1950s. For his part, Walter Brennan, was taller and thinner than I remember him, and an internet search on him disclosed that he won three Oscars in the 1930s, which puts him in an exclusive club of less than a half dozen actors who have received as many Oscars.The story is convoluted and intricate, and probably doesn't make a lot of sense in the cold light of rationality.  Also, it was amusing to see how the Czechs were all played as Americans, with American accents and slang and attitudes, which actually heightened the timeless theme that ""It Could Happen Here,"" which might have been the filmmaker's intention.Not a bad movie, but fascinating as a bit of World War II history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYJ0NBNLSAXCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=630568393X#wasThisHelpful","RYJ0NBNLSAXCJ","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The film even opens up with a spoof set-up as it introduces the characters as archetypal horror movie types.Unfortunately, the gags aren't funny and it decided to become a real slasher film around 20% of the way into the movie.The one ""gag"" that the movie is wrapped around isn't tremendously interesting and the final scene where it is explained seems overwrought.The acting and writing are wooden at best.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W9YXXMLIYJMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQH2M78#wasThisHelpful","R1W9YXXMLIYJMI","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well acted and well written.Titus Welliver delivers in his portrayal of Hieronymus ""Harry"" Bosch as a worldly, cynical yet crusading detective, who, it seems has not quite sacrificed everything for the job, but will.  In one thread of this story, Bosch is dealing with his reputation as a cop who will kill the really bad guy if that is what it takes to protect the public as he is on trial in an unlawful use of force case.  In another, he has to unlock the secrets of a thirty year old cold case murder.  In another, he has to deal with his relationship with an attractive female probationary officer.

"This is one of the early post-Hochhuth attacks on the legacy of Pius XII. The author, Carlo Falconi, was apparently a failed seminary student who went to work as a journalist for left wing Italian journals.  He makes an early point of explaining how he was asked to write a book on Pius XII, but doesn't tell the reader who asked him or why he had any special background for such a book.  He also explains that he had access to Polish and Yugoslavian sources, but, again, doesn't explain how he got that access or why the reader should particularly trust Communist sources, given the history of fabrication of documents and suppression of truth by Communism. He does acknowledge the importance of Rolf Hochhuth's The Deputy in spurring his own book, and at times it seems that the following Hochhuth's arguments and finding historical evidence in Hochhuth's fiction.In essence this book is an extended exercise in moralizing, not history. Of course, when moralizing is the agenda, the conclusion has already been reached, namely that the subject of the moralizing is a moral failure, and it will come as no surprise to find that in each and every chapter, the reader will be clubbed over the head with the moralistic conclusion that Pius XII was Guilty!, Guilty! Guilty!The structure of the book is set up to push the agenda of moralizing.  Thus, rather than start with history, Falconi starts with setting the bar for the moral evaluation of Pius XII's actions.  He sets the bar by offering superficially reasonable, but actually quite tendentious moral propositions by which he intends to evaluate Pius's actions.  This is, of course, a major tell that this is a work of polemics, rather than history, because in a history the facts should come in first, neutrally and with attention paid to all perspectives, and then the facts should be evaluated, again, neutrally with attention paid to all sides. Instead, by beginning with the moral case, Falconi is drafting a legal brief, identifying the elements of the offense, and then marshalling the facts that support the conviction. That is not history, and it is surprising that this book is cited by subsequent writers as if it were a history.Falconi begins with a nod to The Deputy as opening the eyes of the world to Pius's failings. Although why a bloated, eight hour long play by a former Hitler Youth who plays ever anti-Catholic canard he learned in his Protestant upbringing, and which features a ""noble SS officer"" as the moral center of the play, should have had that effect is a mystery.  (See my review of The Deputy.)  But let's permit that mystery to slide by, except to note how certain assumptions made in The Deputy are simply planted without any effort to justify them.Falconi's book is structured by looking at the ""problem"" of Pius's silence first, and then addressing the evidence of that silence with respect to the cases of Poland and Croatia.The first part begins with Falconi essentially trying to establish the case, first, that Pius had a moral obligation to speak in clear and distinct words that could not be viewed 20 years later - out of the context of events - as being indistinct and vague, and, second, that ""the Pope knew"" and, third, that Pius did not do what he ""should"" have done. An alert reader who penetrates the emotional smog will see that these propositions are based on rhetorical and grammatical games, not evidence or logic.As to the first proposition, a relatively alert reader will notice that Falconi is playing a shell game. The title of the book is ""The Silence of Pius XII"" - which apparently promises that there will be proof of, basically, silence. But the reader is almost immediately told that the problem to be addressed is that ""Pius XII never promulgated an explicit and direct condemnation of the war of aggression, and still less of the unspeakable acts of violence carried out by the Germans and their accomplices under cover of the war."" (p. 29.)  With all those qualifications, the alert reader might be tempted to start enumerating all the things that Falconi is willing to agree to, i.e, that Pius gave an explicit, but indirect, condemnation, or that he gave a direct and implicit condemnation, or that some agent of Pius gave an explicit and direct condemnation, all of which actually is true, and leaves the reader - who isn't looking to burnish their anti-Catholic credentials, wondering, what the heck is the problem if Pius gave an indirect and explicit or implicit and direct condemnation?  Are people that stupid?  Didn't they understand that a communication from someone in the easy reach of a regime that murdered its political opponents would be phrased in somewhat elliptical ways?  Couldn't people, you know, adjust for context?In fact, people weren't that stupid. The world at the time knew that Pius had issued condemnation of genocide and racism - which could only have been directed against the Nazis on behalf of Jews, Poles, Gypsies and the rest of the victims of genocide.  Read for example, the headline of the New York Times for October 28, 1939 - weeks after the Nazi invasion of Poland - read ""Dictators, Treaty-Breaking, Racism are condemned by Pope in first encyclical."" Since the Nazis prevented the publication of this first encyclical (See New York Times, November 5, 1939), one suspects that they clearly discerned a ""direct and explicit"" condemnation.  Likewise, on December 25, 1942, the New York Times praised Pius as the lone voice in Europe speaking against the dictators and their racist murderous regime.  A reader who wanted to do more than blindly trust a one-sided presentation by someone with a clear agenda can actually look these headlines up. Someone who wasn't already anti-Pius might applaud Pius for the clever way that he confounded the Nazis. So, what the heck?  How come the benighted readers of the New York Times in 1939 understood something that eluded Falconi in 1966?Moreover, Falconi simply waives off the encyclical that the New York Times found so clear, referring to Pius's first encyclical as involving a ""rather nave"" appeal to the principles of the common origins of humanity and the universal equality of all peoples and condemnation of totalitarian states. (p. 36.) So, as was the case with Hochhuth's ""The Deputy,"" we have another secular author irritated by a religious figure doing the ""religious thing. "" Falconi later waives off Mit Brennender Sorge because it wasn't explicitly or directly anti-Nazi (p. 95), which would have come as a surprise to the Nazis who suppressed the encyclical and arrested the Catholic publishers who printed the encyclical for committing acts of treason.  But Falconi doesn't mention any of that because it wouldn't fit his narrative.Falconi does acknowledge that Pius's purported ""neutral attitude"" - which ""attitude"" didn't exist, albeit the Vatican was a neutral, like Switzerland and Sweden - was not a lack of interest.  Falconi acknowledged that Pius lent his support to a German plot to depose Hitler. (p. 37), but this drops out of the discussion as quickly as it is raised, and in the next paragraph Falconi is talking about Pius's ""closed circle of ecclesiastical interests"" without even attempting to explain how participating in a German plot to depose Hitler fell into this ""closed circle.""  In short, this book is long on paradox and double-talk as it drives to its polemical conclusion.Actually, Pius's role in the plot to depose Hitler resurfaces later, but is used to explain that Pius's ""silence"" - as specially defined by Falconi - cannot be blamed on ""cowardice"" because he supported the coup against Hitler in 1940, but, thereafter backed away from ""such exploits"" for no discernable reason it seems, apart from a flaw in his character.  (p. 87.) It couldn't possibly be because there was no further opportunity or that he was shielding Jews from the Nazis or that Hitler was occupying Rome. So, it seems that even undisputed historical facts that would show Pius in a favorable light are used to cast opprobrium at Pius.The first section of Falconi's book is noteworthy for its logical fallacies as it begs various questions and misdirects attention from the lack of evidence by plucking on emotional heartstrings.  Thus, as to the same Christmas speech that the New York Times found so inspiring, Falconi berates Pius for talking about a crusade for human freedom, ""even though Nazi barbarism could be estimated at some two and a half million.""  Falconi works himself up to a fever pitch about the Nazi death machine and then condemns Pius for announcing that ""the star of Peace is the essential aim of the `necessary and holy Crusade'!"" (p.43.)  As a rhetorical gambit, Falconi's juxtaposition of the death of millions and a ""star of Peace"" seems to implicate Pius as a nave fool or worse.  But this was Pius's Christmas address to a world at war. It was a way of rallying the troops to the cause of democracy.  At least, that was how the Nazis saw it, since they blamed Pius for inciting priests in France against them (New York Times, October 2, 1943), while Cardinal de Lubac explained that it was the Pope's messages that inspired the Catholic French resistance.All of that should give some idea of the span of the Pope's attentions, and the issues he had to pay attention to, something that might be overlooked in a narrowly-focused book on a single issue, however important that issue was, and there were many issues that were important, including the execution of civilians and hostage, the firebombing of civilians, the persecution of religion, winning the war, and winning the peace.The second issue that Falconi looks at is ""Pius knew.""  The problem here is that ""knew"" is a transitive verb that requires an object, i.e., knew what? And what do we mean by ""know,"" i.e., to have notice of or to believe.  Although Falconi is often cited as having shown that Pius must have ""known"" because he had a network of priests and informants, Falconi doesn't have any real evidence on this; he is merely speculating, albeit it is probably a merited speculation. (And Falconi does acknowledge that the Gestapo was keeping ""a close watch on the Vatican,"" the Italian police was monitoring the postal and telegraphic services, and the Gestapo was maintaining surveillance on the diplomatic bags of the nunciatures. (p. 53), which is what one would expect of political police in a totalitarian state.)But Pius didn't have to have a network of ecclesiastical spies - and what a classic bit of anti-Catholic paranoia that presents - he could have just read the New York Times, which reported that Jews were being gassed in an almost-offhand comment on November 28, 1943 that Jews were being gassed.  The odd thing about that comment was that there is no source on it. (Of course, in November of 1943, Rome was occupied by Nazis. See p. 53 (""Between 8 September 1943 and 3 June 1944 (i.e., during the German occupation of Rome) the control was intensified."") Note that Falconi employs euphemism to describe a period when Nazi soldiers were patrolling the streets of Rome, shooting civilians, and searching for Jews, who were hidden in Vatican buildings, as merely ""intensified."") In June of 1944, the first eyewitness reports were released to the press, and on August 30 1944, there was an eyewitness news report by a reporter ""embedded"" with the Russians who had actually seen the death camp at ""Maidanek"" and who made the following revealing comment that ""After inspection of Maidanek, I am now prepared to believe any story of German atrocities, no matter how savage, cruel and depraved.""From our comfortable perspective, we might wonder, what took this reporter so long?  But, of course, there was a natural hesitancy in believing atrocity stories.  In a New York Times article from July 19, 1944, the reporter noted that there had been calls to bomb the death camps, and observed: ""Discounting all exaggerations implicit in atrocity stories, it seems that some 400,000 Jews have been deported from Hungary to places where, according to Czech and Polish stories, they are executed wholesale in gas chambers that do away with hundreds at a time.""But, of course, there was competing evidence. The Red Cross visited Theresienstadt in June of 1944 and reported that the conditions in this Potemkin village were fine.  The Red Cross actually visited Auschwitz in September of 1944 and failed to notice that the purported gas chambers were gas chambers.  In late 1944, the Polish underground was still attempting to get photographic evidence to prove that the Nazi horrors were real.  Apparently the Polish underground knew that some convincing of its allies - people who were anti-Nazis and fighting the Nazis - still remained necessary.But Falconi doesn't address any of these facts, which are part of the historical record and go very far in the direction of explaining what Pius knew and believed and why he did what he did.  The real historian Robert Louis Wilken points out that """"Every act of historical understanding is an act of empathy.""  In polemical books like this one, the point is to avoid any kind of empathy since this book is not about understanding but moralizing. In contrast, there is a far more interesting book waiting to be written about the totality of what people heard from all sources at the time and how they processed all this information to form a picture of the world at the time, uninformed by what we know now.  This moralizing tract is not that book.So, Pius may have known that there were reports of horrible things happening, but he may also have known that there were re-assuring reports, and, like most others in the world, even ardent anti-Nazis prepared to believe the worst, he may have believed that even the Nazis couldn't have been that bad, and that the Nazis could not possibly have been aiming at the scientific, technological liquidation of all Jews.  In fact, in a sense the Nazis' need for slave labor was a kind of check on the Nazi program during the war, so, when Falconi ask ""what more could have been done to the Jews?"", the obvious answer is that the Nazis could have been persuaded to re-order the priorities of their commitment to using Jews as slave labor in order to favor their immediate extermination.Falconi incredibly writes, ""And what worse evils could lie in store for victims destined for massacre than - at the most - massacre at an earlier date?""  If we were to employ the same moral calculation to Falconi that he employs on Pius we could wring our hands about Falconi's inhumanity and cavalier attitude to human life.  Even an extra day of life, surely, is an inestimable treasure since it brought the victims one day closer to liberation.  And, in fact, those who were saved from murder were saved because they were not ""massacred at an earlier date.""  So, we have to wonder what kind of one-sided moral universe Falconi lives in where everything - literally everything - including sparing the lives of victims from death is something that can be laid at Pius's feet as a source of moral opprobrium.The final section of the first part is an attempt by Falconi to define what Pius ""should have done.""  Since Falconi has already infallibly declared that Pius must have known that the Nazis were systematically murdering Jews and Gypsies and Poles, Falconi has no problem in prescribing the formula that Pius should have been direct and explicit, instead of indirect and explicit, or direct and implicit, in condemning the extermination of the Jews, and only the Jews, not the Gypsies, who were Christians, or the Poles, or the Russian POWs.  None of this shilly-shallying about condemning crimes against all the victims will satisfy Falconi in relieving Pius of the burden of.......what?It is never clear what Pius is being accused of.  It's not cowardice, because he did support the German coup.  It may be a misguided reliance on the power of diplomacy, but that seems like a very weak ground on which to accuse Pius of being such a failure. It's not even anti-semitism, despite all the one-sided historical retrospective.Interestingly, Falconi may have tipped his hand as an early participant in what Rabbi Dalin refers to as the internecine Catholic war about the papacy.  At. P. 98, Falconi writes://Fr. Leiber, who regarded Pius XII as a hero, naturally viewed these among his most admirable characteristics. Unfortunately it took the revolutionary advent of Pope John XXIII to convince at least one section of Catholics that a papacy based on the ""Constantinian"" spirit of power was in dangerous contradiction to the true mission of all religious movements and of a Christian Church.//So, Falconi's project may have the same polemical objective as John Cornwell's and others', namely as an opposition to the modern form of the papacy and as a weapon to bludgeon ""ultramontane Catholics,"" who, incidentally, were the ones standing against Hitler in Germany.Falconi rejects any explanation for what he calls the Pope's silence, often on amazingly tendentious grounds. Thus he denies that Pius was ever at any personal risk from Hitler.  For example, Falconi steals Hochhuth's claim that no Bishop was sent to a concentration camp, and embroidered it by claiming that no bishop was ""ever touched. (p. 76.)  But this claim is historically wrong.  The Nazis could - and frequently did - send the friends and relatives of their targets to the concentration camps. This happened to Catholic priests under Bishop von Galen and Bishop von Preysing; those bishops would preach against the Nazis, and fairly quickly the Nazis would be rounding up priests. The Nazis could also stir up ""mob"" action to physically assault Bishops and their residence, which is what happened to Cardinal Innitzer and Bishop von Galen. The Nazis could simply have people murdered, as occurred with the national leaders of Catholic Action. And then there is the salutary example of Bishop Sproll, as described by Guenter Lewy in The Catholic Church And Nazi Germany ://One bishop, Dr. Johannes Baptista Sproll of Rottenburg, also refrained from voting on April 10, but not because of objections to Hitler's annexation of Austria. As he later explained to Cardinal Bertram, ""I gladly welcomed the Anschluss of Austria and celebrated it with a general ringing of bells. Besides other general considerations, I was led to this attitude by my emotional sympa- thies.""155 But since a ""yes"" vote meant electing men he considered hostile to Christianity and Church, and since he did not want to negate his approval of the Anschluss by voting ""no,"" Sproll stayed away from the polls. This led to hostile demonstrations and the bishop had to leave town. A request of the government to the Vatican to have Sproll recalled from his diocese was turned down by Pacelli. Ambassador Bergen reported that Pacelli, nevertheless, ""according to all indications did not approve of the Bishop's actions"" and that in clerical circles Sproll's conduct was called ""very inept.""156 When Sproll, allegedly in accordance with express instructions from the Holy See, returned to Rottenburg on July 16, his palace was broken into and ransacked by a mob. The Bishop refused to leave again but he was eventually forcefully removed by the Gestapo and banished from his diocese.157 It appears that Sproll was the only higher Church dignitary who failed to vote ""yes"" on April 10.//Falconi also claims that Pius was in no danger of being kidnapped, as several of his predecessors had been, but never demonstrates that Pius knew this.  Moreover, Falconi ignores the evidence that this was a live option.Falconi rejects the claim that Pius's public exhortation would have been useless by referring to John XXIII, who ""shook the world,""(p. 82.) which really deserves a series of question marks.  How is calling a conclave of Catholics anything like condemning an anti-Catholic dictator?  Falconi also offers the blanket statement that there were 45 million Catholics who believed they were helping the Catholic Church by collaborating with the New Order (p. 82), but this is nonsense: Catholics knew that the Nazis were anti-Catholics and vice versa, as can be seen in the Memoirs of Joachim Feist or the fact that although Catholics approximated nearly 50% of the new Greater Germany of Hitler, Catholics were only 20% of elite SS.  It seems that most Catholics knew that the Nazis were not their friends.Sometimes Falconi is simply insane as when he explains that the Nazis if faced with unexpected resistance would collapse because ""all sadists have weak characters."" (p. 83.)  One wonders how Falconi could have written this in 1966 when the sadistic Communist empire was in control of half of Europe.  Likewise, Falconi explain that unmasking the death camps to the ""whole world"" would have caused its victims to rebel against their butchers (p. 83), but was this something that the Allies couldn't accomplish, particularly when the Red Cross was visiting Auschwitz and not finding gas chambers?Falconi's final answer is that Pius should have formed a ""united religious front"" to do whatever such fronts do. (p. 102.) Apparently, there was a tentative effort a ""united front"" which Pius rejected.  One wonders what this ""united front"" would have accomplished, and one also wonders why Franklin Roosevelt isn't blamed for not promoting a ""united front"" by facing down anti-Catholics in Congress who refused to permit America to send an official ambassador to the Vatican.In his introduction, Falconi had subtly framed his argument with questionable assumptions. Thus he says that ""a pope who remains silent when serious errors in dogma or morals are spreading all around him is a pope who betrays his own mission."" (p. 18.)  One might ordinarily think so, but not always.  Despite the reasonableness of this proposition, in fact, the office of the papacy isn't primarily about judging right and wrong in political and legal affairs, but to serve the Church as the symbol of unity.  The papacy serves the church and the church serves mankind as the body of Christ.  The purpose of the Church is to provide the sacramental reality of Christ and to teach the Gospel.  There is no fixed or set rule about how the Gospel should be taught.  Sometimes the teaching can be direct and explicit and sometimes, because of the hardness of heart of men, it must be pursued in a less direct way.  Even Jesus when faced with Herod refused to answer Herod's questions.Falconi finally moves into the cases of Poland and Croatia.  Certainly there were voices calling for Pius to condemn various Fascist atrocities, but Falconi ignores the equally well-established fact that there were other voices - usually voices in the occupied countries - unlike the case with the Polish government in exile, who asked Pius not to speak out ""directly and explicitly"" because it would hamper resistance and provoke retaliation.  Harold Tittman, Jr. is cited by Falconi as an American emissary who pressed Pius to speak out, but Falconi, like many other anti-Pius writers, fails to give Tittman's complete and last word on the subject, which is found in his memoir Inside the Vatican of Pius XII: The Memoir of an American Diplomat During World War II.Thus, Tittman notes that Vatican radio stopped providing updates about Nazi atrocities at the request of Polish bishops://""In October 1939, the Jesuit-operated Vatican Radio started to broadcast first-hand accounts of atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis in Poland as reported to the Holy See by its own informants in that country. However, the Polish bishops hastened to notify the Vatican that after each broadcast had come over the air, the various local populations suffered ""terrible"" reprisals.""//And://""The position taken by the Polish Ambassador Pape in 1940 and afterwards, urging the Pope to speak out, appeared to be in conflict with that of the Polish bishops in 1939 when they appealed to Father General Ledochowski to have the Vatican Radio cease its references to Nazi atrocities in Poland. This difference apparently arose because the Ambassador was taking his instructions from the Polish Government-in-exile in London and had no direct communication with the bishops on the spot in Poland.""//And://""Furthermore, the Holy See was still convinced that any forthright denunciations by the Pope, at least insofar as Poland was concerned, would have resulted in the deaths of many.""//Likewise, Tittman learned that the German resistance had asked Pius not to make any condemnations of the Nazis during the war://""My father met Mueller following a speech by the Pope to the College of Cardinals on June 2, 1945, during which the Pope had severely castigated National Socialism and had referred to the deaths of 2000 Catholic priests at Dachau. Dr. Mueller said that during the war his anti-Nazi organization in Germany had always been very insistent that the Pope should refrain from making any public statement singling out the Nazis and specifically condemning them and had recommended that the Pope's remarks should be confined to generalities only. Dr. Mueller said that he was obliged to give this advice, since, if the Pope had been specific, Germans would have accused him of yielding to the promptings of foreign powers and this would have made the German Catholics even more suspected than they were and would have greatly restricted their freedom of action in their work of resistance to the Nazis. Dr. Mueller said that the policy of the Catholic resistance in Germany was that the Pope should stand aside while the German hierarchy carried out the struggle against the Nazis inside Germany, without outside influence being brought to bear. Dr. Mueller said that the Pope had followed this advice throughout the war.""//Tittman offers this assessment of Pius's policies during the war://But Pope Pius XII never did speak out while the war was in progress, so there is no evidence from which to judge whether it was the right thing to do or not.

"...was probably written by a playwright who was a former Hitler Youth member and grew up in Protestant Germany.Once you realize Hochhuth's biases, the book becomes entirely predictable; all you have to do is pretend that you live in a world where the Nazis won and decided to blame the Pope for not using his mystically awesome Pope-powers to stop them from committing genocide.I've been reading and hearing about The Deputy for years.  In almost every book on Pius XII, it gets mentioned, and if the author is anti-Pius, the acknowledgment will include a statement about how they found The Deputy to be challenging and enlightening. Since one should always check the original sources, I decided to read The Deputy and I was surprised to find that this is really an awful book on so many levels.  It is awfully written, awfully plotted, awfully sourced and awfully surprising in its awfulness.The first surprise - which amazingly has never been mentioned in the many books on the Pius Controversy that I've read - is that the Protestant former Hitler Youth playwright, Rolf Hochhuth, selects an SS officer as the moral paragon to compare Pope Pius XII against.Why has no one ever mentioned this obvious bit of ""excusing by accusing""?  Why aren't there any discussions of The Deputy framed around the obvious psychology of excusing his past and country by presenting a ""noble SS officer"" and making the issue about how the Pope in Rome did not stop Germans from murdering Jews?The play  is equally awful in its shallow melodrama.  The villains of the play are unreservedly villainous; the heroes are noble, through and through. The exemplary SS officer, for example, doesn't merely spill state secrets to the Papal Nuncio, he actually hides a Jews in his apartment and drops off food for other Jews being sheltered in Berlin.Awww.....such nice SS officers.One can imagine that this is the image of the SS that the young Hochuth formed as a Hitler Youth, and undoubtedly cherished thereafter.  The SS really weren't the villains, they would have been noble, if only they had been permitted, but the Pope - who actually did shelter Jews - is the real villain.In contrast, the ""Doctor"" character, patterned on Dr. Mengele, is a dime-store villain, who delights in vivisection, blasphemy, murder, and pulling the wings off of butterflies because he is a villain.  No attempt is made to depict a character more rounded than Snidely Whiplash in ""The Adventures of Dudley Do-Right.""The story opens with noble SS officer Kurt Gerstein breaking into the papal nunciature in the summer of 1942 to tell Nuncio Orsenigo about the gas chambers and crematoria.  Orsenigo refuses to hear out the noble Nazi because, according to Hochhuth, he is a bland apparatchik, indifferent to the truth, although the reader might think that it would have been quite reasonable for a member of a persecuted church to have been wary of such an obvious SS entrapment scheme, a ""honey trap,"" that dangles a frothing at the mouth SS officers with state secrets before him, particularly in, you know, Nazi Germany.Although Orsenigo does not listen, the Jesuit priest Riccardo Riccardo, SJ, does. Riccardo is a good Jesuit, we learn eventually, because he is disaffected from the Pope, and agrees with Hitler, who supported the Los von Rom movement, that one can be a good Catholic only so long as one is not an ultramontane Catholic. By the way, there are Jesuits just crawling through this book with their, you know, clandestine, clannish, conspiratorial pulling of the strings of human history. That's right, the Protestant Hitler Youth makes a big nod to the German volk tradition of anti-Catholic anti-Jesuitism.Riccardo listens to Gerstein and is convinced by this frothing at the mouth stranger.  And why shouldn't he be convinced?  After all Gerstein is an Obersturmfuhrer SS, and if you can't trust an SS Obersturmfuhrer, you might as well pack it in and go home.Seriously, this is the great play that had such an effect on changing the world's opinion about Pius XII?Riccardo eventually meets Gerstein in his home and meets the Jew Jacobson who Gerstein is protecting in his apartment. (Yes, seriously, the SS officer is protecting a Jew.)  Riccardo gives Jacobson his passport so that Jacobson can flee Germany, and off Jacobson goes, only to show up in the final act, because this is a melodrama where that kind of thing happens.We also get a scene of delightfully daffy SS professionals unwinding while bowling and making broad jokes about furnaces.Riccardo goes off to Rome - where somehow Gerstein manages to meet him - to hector his father and religious superiors and, eventually, the Pope, about the need for the Pope to make a forceful protest against the Jews being killed in Nazi death camps, specifically and without circumlocution, and not as a general proposition.  No one, however, thinks to interrogate Riccardo about why Riccardo is criminally indifferent to the fate of the Gypsies, Poles and Russians who are also being worked to death and/or shot and/or put in the gas chambers.  They simply don't matter in the moral urgency of Riccardo's universe.Likewise, no explanation is given about the political or military or strategic implications of such an announcement or how the Nazis would react in taking reprisals against Jews, Poles, Russians, Jewish Catholics, German Catholics, etc.  All we know from Hochhuth's characters is that A Protest Would Have Changed Everything!!!  (Apparently, Hochhuth thought that along with a protest would have gone an ""interdict."" (P. 298 (""Who then claim that the Nazis would not have drawn back if during the war Pius had threatened them with the interdict?"")Seriously, Hochhuth's big plan was that the Pope should deprive all German Catholics of the Sacraments during wartime when they were being subjected to aerial bombardment?  And he thinks that Hitler would have said, ""Achtung! German Catholics are not able to save their souls through access to the sacraments. This is a disaster! We must stop committing genocide!  The Pope has outfoxed me again!""This is a plan that only a Protestant former member of the Hitler Youth could think up.Speaking of fantasies, Hochhuth's condemnation of Pius depends on an inflated sense of the Pope's power, which is totally in keeping with the theme that this play was written by an anti-Catholic intoxicated on the paranoid delusions of Jesuit conspiracies rampant in pre-World War II Germany and in the Nazi Party.  Thus, he has Riccardo explain that he cannot take confession - in the anti-Catholic world, the only good Catholic is a bad Catholic - because the SS and the Vatican are conspiring with each other://You would have to refuse me absolution for I cannot repent.  Please understand me, Father General. For the past three months ever since Rome has been occupied by the Germans, I have hoped that at last the SS and the Vatican would come together in a bloody clash. Instead the most ghastly thing of all is happening - they are not even jarring one another.  They live together, harmoniously, in the Eternal City - because the Pope does not forbid the murderers of Auschwitz to herd their victims into trucks beneath his very windows.""// (p. 163.)So, the best thing that could happen in the eyes of Hochhuths' ""good Catholic"" is that Romans and Germans start killing each other, and how do we think that might turn out?  Further, notice how Hochhuth simply plants the proposition that the Pope could forbid German soldiers from doing something.  Apparently, Hochhuth has some super-secret document that puts the Pope into the SS chain of command.Playing into the cultural anti-Catholic baggage, Hochhuth has Riccardo arrive in Rome on the day that Pope Pius XII consecrated the world to the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin. (p. 95.)  This event is absolutely gratuitous since, as Hochhuth points out in his concluding essay, the consecration actually occurred the previous October of 1942.//""Fontana: Because the Pope this morning consecrated the world to the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin.  A very tiring ceremony. Right after came my audience - and then the decoration suddenly came my way - I had no idea.Ricardo: Mama would have been very happy - how we miss her in the house and everywhere....""// (p. 95.)The question is why is this necessary to the play?  Now, admittedly this a great, bloated whale of a play, clocking in at 8 hours, but apparently it is important to move things around so that we get a reference to what a Protestant would view as an excessive, strange, cultish bit of a Papist superstition.  If you've read anything on how Protestants viewed Catholics during the Kulturkampf, then mark the boxes on your anti-Catholic bingo card.  Also, notice the reference to ""Mama being proud""and ask, ""what would she have been proud of?""  The medal or the consecration?  If the latter, that plays perfectly into Protestant tropes about Catholicism being a religion for women.Riccardo underscores the criticism of Catholic doctrine with this://Riccardo (bitterly amused, takes a glass from his father): ""The things they think about in Rome! Take poverty, for instance, which, in practice, means that as a nation's churches grow in number, so do its prostitutes.  Naples and Sicily - centers of vice beneath the windows of the Vatican. Instead of helping, we debate how frequently a married couple may cohabitate. Or if a widow may remarry.  And now to top it off, the dogma of the Virgin. Does he have nothing else to do?""// (p. 96.)Yeah!  What is up with the Pope and those Catholics being concerned about Catholic doctrine! They should be more like, you know, Protestants! And Nazis!Running through the play is the buried assumption of the paranoid anti-Catholic conspiracy monger, the same attitude that inflamed so many American anti-Catholics, the assumption that Catholics were all set to rise up and take power at the moment the Pope gave the command. Thus, Hochhuth has Riccardo's father say to the Pope://""Your Holiness, may I ask in all humility: Warn Hitler that you will compel five hundred million Catholics to make Christian protest if hoes on with these mass killings.""//(p. 204.)Hah, my mother's uncle -who she remembers in the 1930s going on about how the Catholics ""all have guns in the church basements"" - would have understood and agreed with this point.  All the Pope had to do was tell German Catholics to rebel or protest or do who knows what and the war would have ended in a fortnight, without any reprisals against anyone.Except that that is not the way it works.  There is no general provision in canon law or Catholic doctrine for ""uprisings on command of the Pope,"" no matter what paranoid conspiracy fantasists may think.The Pope pens a condemnation that is vague and general, i.e., like all Vatican pronouncements, and this doesn't satisfy Riccardo, who tells the Pope://""you Holiness, what you have set your name to grants Hitler unrestricted license to go on treating the Jews as he has always done...""// (p. 217.)Because Hitler was just waiting for the Pope's permission.Previously, Riccardo had explained how the Pope was actually responsible in some way for the Holocaust://'Just read the ghastly details from Poland and Rumania published two weeks ago. How shall we ever find apologies for our silence. (sic)  And those bells!  They ring and ring as though the world were Paradise.  What sheer unfeeling idiocy to offer this earth to the Blessed Virgin's heart. Does not the Pope who holds within his hand five-hundred million Catholics - twenty per cent subjects of Hitler now - does he not share responsibility for the moral climate of this world? How can he have the audacity....""// (p. 97.)It all is too much for Riccardo, who decides to pin the Jewish star on his cassock. That, in turn, is too much of a sacrilege for the Pope - a Jewish star on a priest's cassock! - who banishes Riccardo from his sight, with words that would have cheered the coldest heart of a German Protestant during the Kulturkampf://""Rebellion in these rooms! Disobedience and arrogance - Protestantism.// (p. 219.)So, the Los von Rom (""away from Rome"") movement, lauded by Hitler and supported by Protestants, is finally vindicated by demonstrating that only a Catholic who severs ties with Rome can be a righteous Catholic. Catholic priests who are good become Protestants,says the Protestant German former Hitler Youth member.Riccardo then accompanies some Jewish Catholics to Auschwitz where he meets the Dr. Mengele villain who is a sadist, through and through, and who, in classic villain trope, intends to taunt Riccardo until he denies God.  Riccardo also meets Jacobson - remember him from the first part of this review? - who didn't make it out of Germany.  Gerstein is there also, because when he isn't visiting the Pope, naturally, he works in Auschwitz. Gerstein has a  scheme to get Riccardo released, but Riccardo decides to have Jacobson go in his place, but Mengele uncovers the plot. Shots ring out! Gerstein survives; Riccardo dies; Mengele cackles.The end.Like I said, this ia a B-grade melodrama that must throw the red meat to people who already are half-convinced that Catholics are controlled from Rome and were somehow really responsible for the Holocaust.Hochhuth offers a hit or miss bit of potted history to justify his drama, which he claims is substantially accurate.  The problem is that it is mostly nonsense that makes its argument from the rhetorical appeal of putting sentences together and making great leaps of speculation.For example, although I've been reading contemporary anti-Pius books,  I'd never heard of Gerstein.  It seems that modern authors keep their distance from this SS saint.  It appears that there was a Kurt Gerstein who was in the SS.  He was captured after the war and wrote a confession exposing Auschwitz - although if Auschwitz was so well-known, what did he think he was exposing? Gerstein claimed that he tried to tell the Papal Nuncio, but never got in to seem (because, jeepers, he was an SS officer) and that he told other notables about what was happening at Auschwitz in the summer of 1942.  There is absolutely no corroboration for any of this.  There are statements from some anti-Nazis that they knew Gerstein to be a member of the Confessing Church and that he went to meetings of opponents of Nazism and was a true-blue Nazi opponent.So, that all seems weird. Maybe he was an SS plant.  Maybe he was a conflicted patriot. We probably should take the declarations with a grain of salt because they were obtained during the de-Nazification trials, and there was a trade in Nazi opponents giving clearances to their friends. Also the courts concluded that there was an insufficient basis on which to find Gerstein to  be a Nazi opponent.So, all that probably explains why the anti-Pius forces leave Gerstein out of their presentations.Consistent with his presentation of the ""saintly SS officer"" is Hochhuth's attempts to excuse Germans wherever he can. For example, despite the fact that Bishop Hudal is usually cited as evidence for the Vatican's pro-Nazi leanings, in that Hudal provided passes for Nazis to escape Europe, Hochhuth attests to Bishop Hudal's bona fides: ""This letter alone (we cannot compare it with anything from the pen of an Italian bishop because no Italian bishop ever protested openly against the persecution of the Jews) should be enough to shield Bishop Hudal from the condemnation hurled at him only because he, like almost all the clergy, was duped by Hitler for a while. A further point in his honor: he hid Jews in the monastery dell'Anima.""// (p. 327.)  On my point about Hochhuth's apparent crypto-Nazi bias in the play is the fact that Hudal was also famous for penning a work that attempted to explain how Catholicism could accommodate National Socialism.  I learned tonight from listening to Dietrich von Hildebrandt's Memoirs - My Battle Against Hitler: Faith, Truth, and Defiance in the Shadow of the Third Reich - that Hildebrandt, a Catholic Nazi-fighter when it could have cost him his life - had nothing but contempt for Hudal because of this effort to sell the anti-Christ to Catholics. Note, though, that Hochhuth prefers to make the moral center of his play an SS officer and he defends the honor of a Nazi-apologist.  The coincidences of Hochhuth's sympathies and antipathies seem marvelously coordinated. Thus, Pius who hid thousands of Jews under the nose of the SS doesn't merit Hochhuth's approbation, but a Nazi and a Nazi-sympathizer do.Weird.Hochhuth seems even more insistent about protecting the Soviets from moral question. Thus, he floats the notion that the Germans were responsible for massacring the Poles at the Katyn Forest, and he argues, twice, that the Russians were innocent victims of Nazi aggression://""Riccardo: Permit me, Your Eminence - the moral right, surely, is on the Russian side, without a doubt. They are waging a just war!  They were attacked, their country devastated, their people carried off, slaughtered. If they are threatening Europe now, the blame is only Hitler's.""// (p. 115.)Excuse me, but......what????Hitler launched his attack on the Soviets in Soviet Poland.  Hitler could attack the Soviets in Poland because in 1939 the Soviets and the Nazis had formed a pact to divide Poland.  If the Soviets had not colluded with the Nazis to divide Poland, there would have been no World War II and no Holocaust.  To describe the Soviets as ""innocent"" and engaged in a ""just war"" is akin to describing the ""property rights"" that one thief has against another in the property they have jointly stolen.For all his vaunted self-claims of research, Hochuth makes repeated errors. For example, Hochhuth claims that Hoss - the Commandant of Auschwitz - studied for the priesthood. This is not true inasmuch as Hoss rejected Catholicism in his teens, joined the German Army at 17, and rejected his family's plans that he study for the priesthood when he returned from World War I.  Likewise, Hochhuth claims that the Pope protested a couple of bombs accidentally dropped in the Vatican gardens, which killed no one.  I spent  some time looking through the New York Times archives for his incident, and it seems that during the German occupation of Rome, a single plane circled the Vatican, deliberately bombed it, and left.  The Vatican issued what Hochhuth would consider a vague and general statement about the importance of respecting its neutrality, but did not name anyone.  Months later, the Vatican indicated that it knew who was responsible, and there was speculation in the paper that the culprit was a fascist anti-clerical leader.  It is an odd incident, but nothing like what Hochhuth claims.In short, Hochhuth is unreliable and something of a kook.  Before reading this book, I assumed that Hochhuth would come off as a Leftist.  In reading this book, I formed the impression that Hochhuth was more of rightwing German nationalist. It seems that recently he has become a friend of Holocaust denier David Irving, which I don't find surprising from this play.  One would be well-advised to never base any argument on some factoid found in this book without first fact checking the claim.Another point to ponder, under the heading of ""tells"" showing a deeply ingrained anti-Catholicism, is found in all of Hochhuth's references to burning people.  References to burning, and the crematorium of Auschwitz are found throughout the text. Characters are always describing the horrors of the chimneys and the burning of bodies.  The evil Doctor threatens to burn Riccardo alive. Other characters talk about the horror of people who are not entirely dead when they are cremated.  But the purpose of the crematoria was to dispose of dead bodies, even bodies of victims who were shot or hung. So what gives? One would think that the horror would be the actual instrument of death - the gas chamber - and the metaphors of death would involve gas and gassing (but that might raise the uncomfortable fact that Gerstein supplied the Zyklon B to Auschwitz.)The answer is that it seems that, in some deeply buried connection, formed in his earliest development, Hochhuth associates Catholicism with burning heretics. Hochhuth makes his atavistic connection perfectly clear when he has the evil Doctor observe://""A civilization that commits its children's souls into the safeguard of a Church responsible for the Inquisition comes to the end it deserves when for its funeral pyres it plucks the brands from our furnaces for human bodies. Do you admit that? Of course not. (Spits and pours a glass of brandy for himself.) One of us is honest - the other credulous. (Malignantly.) Your Church was the first to show that you can burn men just like coke. In Spain alone, without the benefit of crematoria, you turned to ashes three hundred and fifty thousand human beings, most of them while alive, mind you. Such an achievement surely needs the help of Christ."") (p. 249.)Notice the further example of a ""hit and run"" bit of historical slander: the actual number was more like 3,000 over 400 years, according to recognized historians, and after an opportunity to recant, and a trial, and never for racial reasons. Nonetheless, by this noxious bit of slander, Hochhuth is able to shift the burden of the Holocaust to Catholicism, viz, it was really Catholicism that provided the model for the Holocaust, Catholicism set the standards that the Nazis merely followed.Finally, Hochhuth repeatedly emphasizes that no Catholic bishop was sent to a concentration camp.  Perhaps not, but the Nazis didn't have to send people to concentration camps to exercise their rule of terror.  The Nazis could - and frequently did - send the friends and relatives of their targets to the concentration camps. This happened to Catholic priests under Bishop von Galen and Bishop von Preysing; those bishops would preach against the Nazis, and fairly quickly the Nazis would be rounding up priests. The Nazis could also stir up ""mob"" action to physically assault Bishops and their residence, which is what happened to Cardinal Innitzer and Bishop von Galen. The Nazis could simply have people murdered, as occurred with the national leaders of Catholic Action. And then there is the salutary example of Bishop Sproll, as described by Guenter Lewy in The Catholic Church And Nazi Germany ://One bishop, Dr. Johannes Baptista Sproll of Rottenburg, also refrained from voting on April 10, but not because of objections to Hitler's annexation of Austria. As he later explained to Cardinal Bertram, ""I gladly welcomed the Anschluss of Austria and celebrated it with a general ringing of bells. Besides other general considerations, I was led to this attitude by my emotional sympa- thies.""155 But since a ""yes"" vote meant electing men he considered hostile to Christianity and Church, and since he did not want to negate his approval of the Anschluss by voting ""no,"" Sproll stayed away from the polls. This led to hostile demonstrations and the bishop had to leave town. A request of the government to the Vatican to have Sproll recalled from his diocese was turned down by Pacelli. Ambassador Bergen reported that Pacelli, nevertheless, ""according to all indications did not approve of the Bishop's actions"" and that in clerical circles Sproll's conduct was called ""very inept.""156 When Sproll, allegedly in accordance with express instructions from the Holy See, returned to Rottenburg on July 16, his palace was broken into and ransacked by a mob. The Bishop refused to leave again but he was eventually forcefully removed by the Gestapo and banished from his diocese.157 It appears that Sproll was the only higher Church dignitary who failed to vote ""yes"" on April 10.//Of course, mentioning these facts would tend to obscure the dramatic force of the argument for people who already associate Catholicism with the ""whore of Babylon.""The bottom line is that this is a long-winded, poorly written bit of melodrama that distorts the historical record for a polemical purposes based on an appeal to bigotry.  This play is ""Jud Suss"" for anti-Catholics. This play competes in the bad writing and bad history department with Dan Brown's The DaVinci Code.  The only way to explain the popularity of either of these bloated, poorly written and stupid texts is that they feed the self-conceit of a certain class of people by telling them things they already think they know.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFXI0EC9Z9RDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802142427#wasThisHelpful","RFXI0EC9Z9RDQ","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a seriously odd little movie.  Initially I was not well disposed to it, but over time the actors and their interactions began to grow on me.The plot involves the main character returning to his parents home after he can't find a job. His parents live in a small town where he was fat and unpopular and saw ghosts.  Now he is hipster, thin and hasn't seen ghosts for a while.  His father is a football coach who is disappointed by he weird son.

"These are the memoirs of Rudolf Hoss.  In the summer of 1941, Hoess was given orders by SS leader Heinrich Himmler to make arrangements to implement the Final Solution at Auschwitz. Thereafter, Hoss dutifully developed the buildings and systems necessary for murdering Jews in a systematic manner and disposing of their corpses. Hoss complied, writing, in his memoirs, in 1946://According to Himmler's orders, Auschwitz became the largest human killing center in all of history. When he gave me the order personally in the summer of 1941 to prepare a place for mass killings and then carry it out, I could never have imagined the scale, or what the consequences would be. Of course, this order was something extraordinary, something monstrous. However, the reasoning behind the order of this mass annihilation seemed correct to me . At the time I wasted no thoughts about it. I had received an order, I had to carry it out. I could not allow myself to form an opinion as to whether this mass extermination of the Jews was necessary or not. At the time it was beyond my frame of mind. Since the Fhrer himself had ordered ""The Final Solution of the Jewish Question,"" there was no second guessing for an old National Socialist, much less an SS officer. ""Fhrer, you order. We obey"" was not just a phrase or a slogan. It was meant to be taken seriously.Hoss, Rudolf (2012-08-31). Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz (Kindle Locations 2599-2605). Prometheus Books. Kindle Edition.I think the value of this book is to provide the ""qualia"" of the history.  Hoess seems to get some things wrong, e.g., he reports that Niemoller contemplated converting to Catholicism, but to the extent that this book reflects Hoess's memoirs, then it offers a window into the mindset of human evil.To some extent, the book highlights the importance of the World War I experience on the generation of Germans who became Nazis. Hoss describes how he joined the German army underaged and was sent to Turkey and Palestine, where he learned the trade of killing. He excelled at this trade, receiving promotions to sergeant before he was 23. He returned to Germany - actually fighting his way back through eastern Europe rather than surrender to the British. In Germany, he joined the Freikorps, where he continued the trade of killing.  Eventually, he led the murder of someone who was believed to be an informant and was sentenced to prison for ten years as a ""political criminal,"" but was released after five years as part of a general amnesty.Because of his experience in prison, he was recruited to the SS for work in Nazi concentration camps. Once in the SS, Hoss received serial promotions until he was Kommandant of Auschwitz, and from there he was promoted to the relatively cushy job of inspector of the concentration camps.Hoss's memoirs contain some surprising elements.  For example, Hoss was impressed with the courageously committed lunacy of the Jehovah Witnesses://When they were put into cells and told of the death sentence, they went completely insane with joy and happiness. They couldn't stand the wait until the execution. They wrung their hands over and over, looked up joyously and called out repeatedly, ""Soon we will be with Jehovah. What good luck we have that we have been chosen for this."" A few days earlier they had attended an execution of one of their fellow believers and could hardly be controlled even then. They continuously asked to be shot. This frenzy became a burden to watch. When they were first arrested, they had to be taken by force, but now when their time came, they practically ran double time to their own execution . They did not want to be tied up, so that they would be able to raise their hands to Jehovah. They stood in front of the wooden execution wall with a radiance and ecstasy which was no longer human. This is the way I had always pictured the first Christian martyrs as they waited in the arena to be torn apart by wild beasts. With their faces completely transfigured, eyes directed to heaven, hands folded in prayer and exalted, they went to their death. All who saw them die were deeply moved. Even the execution squad was numbed. The Jehovah's Witnesses becameHoss, Rudolf (2012-08-31). Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz (Kindle Locations 1643-1652). Prometheus Books. Kindle Edition.Hoss also speaks of his father's Catholicism as ""fanatical,"" and he makes it clear that he was an apostate Catholic, apparently because he believed that a priest had betrayed his confessional confidences. Apparently, Hoss's father's fanatical Catholicism put the father into opposition with the state (and with nationalism, which is conventional trope from the Kulturkampf), which must have been difficult for the patriotic young Hoss to reconcile://I can still recall how my father was a determined opponent of the Kaiser's government because he was such a fanatic Catholic. But in spite of his political views, he constantly reminded his friends that the laws of the government were to be obeyed unquestioningly.Hoss, Rudolf (2012-08-31). Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz (Kindle Locations 738-740). Prometheus Books. Kindle Edition.There is a psychological appendix in this text that offers some insights into Hoss.  The appendix points to Hoss's having been raised in a dogmatic world of black and white where his father had schooled him into a sense of duty as a reason for his willingness to become a mass murderer. Likewise, the appendix explains that Hoss judged the morality of a person on his intentions and willingness to sacrifice self, such that some guards who were corrupt were evil, whereas Hoss who was wiling to work long hours was good: a kind of works righteousness.On the other other hand, Hoss speaks for himself in terms of his anti-religiousness in language that modern New Atheists would use://Later I saw the same thing going on in Nazareth. I talked about it with my comrades because this trivial traffic in so-called holy objects by the Church disgusted me. Most of my comrades didn't care and said that if the people were so dumb to fall for such a fraud , they would just have to pay for their stupidity. Others just thought of it as a tourist industry which happens at special places . Only a few, as deeply Catholic as I was, condemned these activities of the Church. They too were disgusted by the sick manipulation of the sincere religious feelings of the pilgrims who often sold everything they owned just to see the holy places once in their lives. For a long time after my discharge from the army I tried to come to terms with what I experienced, and this was probably the reason I later left the Church .Hoss, Rudolf (2012-08-31). Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz (Kindle Locations 856-862). Prometheus Books. Kindle Edition.And://In religious instruction we were told that if a person went to communion without confession, he would be severely punished by God. We were told that someone had done that and had dropped dead at the communion rail. With childish simplicity I begged God to be lenient because I could no longer confess faithfully and to forgive my sins, which I now recited directly to him. So I believed I was free of my sins. Full of doubt, I went trembling to the communion rail in a strange church. And nothing happened! So I, poor little earthworm, believed that God would hear my prayers and agree with what I was doing. The deep, true, childlike faith which so calmly and surely guided my soul until this time was smashed.Hoss, Rudolf (2012-08-31). Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz (Kindle Locations 783-788). Prometheus Books. Kindle Edition.Another point that I found surprising was that so many non-Jews being murder in Auschwitz. The tendency has been to focus so exclusively on the Holocaust, that we forget the hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who were mass-murdered by the Nazis. For example, while they may not have been gassed, there were days when Polish intellectuals were shot at the ""Black Wall of Death"" by the hundreds, and the gas chambers were first tested on Soviet POWs. Similarly, in November of 1943 we read in the timeline:Three hundred thirty-four Soviet POWs were brought from Viljandi in Estonia. All were disabled veterans. All were killed in the gas chamber on December 10.Hoss, Rudolf (2012-08-31). Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz (Kindle Locations 6377-6378). Prometheus Books. Kindle Edition.Why? Why was this necessary or even understandable in terms of Nazi policy?We should not forget the Jews, certainly, but shouldn't we remember the others?  And, I wonder, if it wasn't for the Holocaust, would Auschwitz be as forgotten as Andersonville?Other details surprised me. For example://Until the beginning of 1942 the main body of prisoners was Polish . They all knew that they would have to remain in the concentration camp at least for the duration of the war. Most of them believed that Germany would lose the war; after Stalingrad 5 practically everyone agreed. By listening to the enemy broadcasts they were accurately informed about Germany's ""real situation."" It was not very difficult to listen to enemy news since there were enough radios in Auschwitz.Hoss, Rudolf (2012-08-31). Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz (Kindle Locations 2127-2130). Prometheus Books. Kindle Edition.I wonder about how it was possible for Auschwitz inmates to have radios?The book also has several other portions apart from the memoirs, including a timeline and Hoss's survey of SS personnel, which might be useful for someone researching the individuals that participated in Nazi war crimes.In terms of the interminable Pius Wars, I note the following from the timeline:April 5 A Jewish prisoner named Siegfried Lederer escaped from the Family Camp in Birkenau and made it to Czechoslovakia. As a member of the resistance movement he was able to warn the Elders of the Council in Theresienstadt about the fate of the Jews sent to Auschwitz. April 7 Two Jewish prisoners, Alfred Wetzler and Rudolf Vrba, escaped from Birkenau. They managed to get to Czechoslovakia and joined the partisans. Rudolf Vrba wrote a report about Auschwitz for the Papal Nuncio in Slovakia, which was received in the Vatican by the middle of June.Hoss, Rudolf (2012-08-31).

Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz (Kindle Locations 6569-6571). Prometheus Books. Kindle Edition.So, it seems that the secrecy about the planned exterminations at Auschwitz were breaking down in 1944, although even after the first stories were revealed, there was still efforts being made to verify and document the claims. In addition, how porous was Auschwitz in late 1944 that Polish Resistance members could infiltrate?A Thomist might appreciate this://My tremendous love for my country and my feeling for everything German brought me into the NSDAP [the Nazi Party] and into the SS. I believed that the National Socialist world philosophy was the only one that suited the German people. The SS was, in my opinion, the most energetic defender of this philosophy , and the only one capable of leading the German people back to a life more in keeping with its character.My family was the second thing that was sacred to me. I am firmly anchored to it.Hoss, Rudolf (2012-08-31). Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz (Kindle Locations 3255-3259). Prometheus Books. Kindle Edition.There is a tendency to explain Nazism as a product of ""hate,"" but to a Thomist, hate doesn't motivate; love motivates.  People are attracted and moved to action by the love of some good. In the case of Hoss and the Nazis that love was the love of nation.Likewise, a Thomist knows that evil is the absence of some good, some property ordering to goodness.  In Hoss's statement, we can see that in the fact that he places nation above family. For Hoss, the highest love was for the highest good, which was the German nation.  A distorted Nationalism, rather than anti-semitism, might be a good place to look to for the explanation of Nazism.Ultimately, though we are left with the mystery of how Hoss could write:Without realizing it, I had become a cog in the terrible German extermination machine.Hoss, Rudolf (2012-08-31). Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz (Kindle Locations 3289-3290). Prometheus Books. Kindle Edition.And://Today I realize that the extermination of the Jews was wrong, absolutely wrong. It was exactly because of this mass extermination that Germany earned itself the hatred of the entire world. The cause of anti-Semitism was not served by this act at all, in fact, just the opposite. The Jews have come much closer to their final goal.Hoss, Rudolf (2012-08-31). Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz (Kindle Locations 3219-3221). Prometheus Books. Kindle Edition.How could he not have known that mass extermination was wrong?  Unless, of course, he means that it was 'tactically"" wrong rather than morally wrong?  If that is the case, then Hoss went through a life without learning anything important.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IA8BIYELLD6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C4B2K2O#wasThisHelpful","R3IA8BIYELLD6E","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an academic work which explores various issues pertaining to the formation of a single nation out of a country historically divided into opposing religious camps.  In 1870, the German state was formed after Prussia's successful campaigns against Catholic France and Catholic Austria.  The ""small German"" state that was formed contained a population that was 2/3 Protestant and  1/3 Catholic. The Catholic/Protestant division was defined by history to be intense and antithetical.  One of the many useful insights that the book provides is a map at the frontispiece that shows the division of Germany by Protestant/Catholic population density. The map is fascinating in showing how heavily segregated Germany in 1870 was, to put the information in modern American terms, it would be as if America was a checkerboard pattern of Oklahomas (90% Protestant) and New Mexicos (90% Catholics), with the New Mexicos found mostly at the periphery.  Of course, this is not surprising on reflection; 200 years of the principle of ""cuius regio, eius religio"" would be bound to have that effect.However, the map shows part of the problem that Bismarck faced in creating a unified Reich. The other part involved the history of mutual confessional suspicion and the fact that nearby foreign powers, and the largest unassimilated minority - the Poles - were all Catholics.  It seems not unsurprising that Bismarck would have viewed the large Catholic minority, with its ""ultramontane"" allegiance to a foreign power, as a potential destabilizing Fifth Column. Breaking the power of the Catholic Church, or breaking the allegiance of Catholics to Rome, would seem to be an obvious policy for Bismarck, as it has been for every state builder in the 20th Century.The process of breaking the Catholic Church was called the Kulturkampf. The Kulturkampf involved a series of laws - the May laws - which attempted to subjugate the institutional Catholic church to the power of the German state, by giving the state veto power over the appointment and education of priests and suppressing and exiling monastic orders. As the institutional Catholic church opposed the attempts of the Reich to invade its religious prerogatives, the Reich imprisoned bishops and priests.  At one point, most of the Prussian bishops were imprisoned and over a thousand parishes had no priest.What will come as a surprise to modern readers is the fact that the Kulturkampf was a project carried out by liberals.  As Smith points out, liberalism was quintessentially nationalistic, and nationalism presupposed that everything would be subjugated to the state://The Manichaean vision of the poets and the polemicists of the Kulturkampf contained as its counterpart an ethos of completely assimilation to the values of the new national state. This ethos, demonstrably shared by the vast majority of German liberals, insisted that if Catholics were to be recognized as true Germans, they must rescind the weight of their dark, intolerant, and un-German past, a weight that bore down heavily not just on the Catholic religious community but on the development of the German nation as a whole. Once freed, the German nation, would then experience a new dawn, a second spring. Only then, opined one balladeer, ""can the German cathedral of unity/Rise in its full beauty."" (p. 37.)And://In the struggle against this religious culture, for which nationalist intellectuals had little understanding and even less patience, the interventionist state, and not the people, constituted the most reliable ally. Treitschke observed ""For us the state is not, as it is for the Americans, a power to be contained so that the will of the individual may remain uninhibited, but rather a cultural power from which we expect positive achievements in all areas of national life."" (p. 37.)Of course, the use of state power was done with the best of intentions://To German liberals, of both the left and the right, the state represented, at least in its potential, an agent of modernization: the church, by contrast, a bulwark of backwardness."" (p. 38.)And://It is typically assumed that the German-liberal appeal to state power represented a distortion of true liberal values, that in the universal conflict between force and freedom German liberals exalted the former at the expense of the latter.  But, in fact, many did not perceive the tension.  Force, argued Treitschke, would be harnessed in the service of freedom. Indeed, given the spiritual poverty of the people (as they actually existed), force was necessary in order to create a common high culture, the precondition for the development of liberal values. ""Many precious benefits of freedom are given to people only through state coercion,"" Treitschke maintained. Freedom from clerical bondage constituted one such benefit. Constantin Rossler argued that should the clergy continue to resist the Kulturkampf measures of the state, then ""the state will have no choice but to deny its citizens regardless of their confession (sic!) the guidance of the Roman clergy."" (p. 39.)//German liberals, it should be clear, urged the repression of ultramontanism, not in opposition to, but rather in consonance with, their basic principles.  And these principles served not as a brake on Bismarck's illiberal"" attacks on the Catholic church but rather as its ideological justification. (p. 40.)In the first part of the book, Smith examines the cultural distance between Protestants and Catholics in terms of literature and culture.  Protestants assumed that their way was the way of modernity and progress, and that Catholics were superstitious, unmanly and ignorant. For their part, Catholics were quite content to engage in religious polemics.The Kulturkampf sparked a Catholic political resistance through the formation of the Catholic Center Party and through Catholic newspapers. The tendency was for Catholics to remain extremely united in their ""ultramontane"" politics.  Over the course of time, a decade to two decades after the Kulturkampf was started, Catholics found themselves forming political alliances with various Protestant parties on ephemeral issues of agricultural policies and inheritance issues.  In addition, the Reich found itself in a position of needing Catholic votes to pursue its military and naval construction policies.  As a result, and in the interest of ""official nationalism,"" the Reich found itself needing to dampen down ""popular nationalism,"" which was anti-Catholic, in order to maintain peace in the nation.Smith also describes the development of an antiultramontane, anti-Catholic Protestant League that worked in the shadows to foment a pan-Protestant, anti-Catholic political sentiment.  Ultimately, the Protestant League was unsuccessful, but at the turn of the century, it was the fourth most popular, civilian voluntary organization in Germany (albeit it found itself at odds with other Protestant organizations who thought that the anti-Catholic focus was letting greater threats - such as socialism - to pass unchallenged.Smith closes his book with the Los von Rom movement, by which German evangelicals attempted to exploit ethnic German hostility in Austria to the elevation in 1898 of the social and legal status of the Czech language into a vehicle that would lead Catholic Austrians ""away from Rome.""  The movement had its successes - by 1907, approximately 70,000 Catholic Austrians had converted to Protestantism - but it was ultimately suppressed by Germany and Austria because it was far too destabilizing for both dynasties.However, the Los von Rom movement, messianic, ethnic, even racist, was formative to Hitler and, one suspects, Nazism.Smith makes the following points about the Los von Rom movement://In 1897 the Protestant League discussed whether to lend its considerable organizational support to anti-clerical groups in Austria. In the following year at the Magdeburg general assembly in October of 1898, the league created an Committee to Support the Evangelical Movement in Austria. Led by two pastors, Friedrich Meyer and Paul Braunlich, the committee consisted of eleven members, seven of whom sat on the Protestant League's central committee. p. 208.In an anonymously published contraband pamphlet Germanic Faith, Braunlich argued for his ""Protestant Pan-Germany"" by appealing to the hand of God and the logic of social Darwinism. History, he wrote had demonstrated that ""the races that have adopted Protestantism stand at the pinnacle."" Following Houston Steward Chamberlain, Braunlich reasoned that ""Protestantism is the religion of master nations [Herrennationen]"" whereas Roman Catholicism is ""the religion of peoples in decline."" A ""robust, masculine and therefore essentially German Christianity,"" Protestantism strengthened the nation; effeminate, irrational, and Latin, Catholicism weakened it.In the coming life-and-death struggle of nations, ""Germany,"" he prophesied,""could only survive if it became completely Protestant."" Fate therefore demanded that Germany be guided by one faith, one church - ""a church of the German nation,"" a church that would steel Germans spiritually and undergird them with a hard-wrought structure of common religious belief. To this end, he called upon ethnic Germans in the Habsburg empire to break from Rome and ""come home to German Protestantism."" p. 209.Braunlich's ideaas were widely shared among the active organizers of Los von Rom, especially in Austria, where he wielded considerable influence. In the German empire itself, Friedrich Meyer served as the movement's spiritual director. Like Braunlich, Meyer drew from Chamberlain's ideas and was especially influenced by the Foundation of the Nineteenth Century, a book from which he believed ""one could learn something about the importance of race, especially the German race, for history."" p. 209...to make German Catholics acceptable as equals in the national community, they must be divested of their ties to their (""foreign"") church and its specific values. p. 209.From Chamberlain, he learned that ""the greatest and most dangerous enemy of the Germanic race is the Roman church."" But Rome was not just a foreign power; rather its danger lay in its ability to corrupt and spoil German national character at home, not the least through mixed marriages. Thus it was necessary to root out ultramontanism, which weakened the German nation. ""Only when ultramontanism is broken,"" Meyer thought, ""is a strong German policy possible."" p. 210.The language of Los von Rom and the messianic vision behind it pushed a certain tradition of thinking about the confluence of religious and national identity perilously close to the edge of an ideological precipice. The demand for one nation, one Reich, one religion not only foreshadowed a more ominous appeals in the not too distant future, but it also posed a direct, and present, challenge to he house of Hohensollern and the house of Habsburg, both which (especially the latter) ultimately based their legitimacy on traditions of dynastic acquisition. p. 219The movement's initial success (1898/99: about eight thousand conversions) convinced the two governments to repress Los von Rom. p. 219.From beginning to end, the Los von Rom movement and the Protestant League's support of it were influenced by the shifting sands of Pan-German politics in the Dual Monarchy. At the hour of the movement's inception, on 15 January 1899, Meyer and Witte participated in the Vienna conference of Pan-Germans organized by Georg Ritter von Schonerer, the Austrian anti-Semite best known for a petition he submitted to the Reichsrat in 1887 that claimed that ""our anti-Antisemitism not directed against the religion but against the racial characteristics of the Jews."" A convinced racist and zealous Pan-German, Schonerer was also the most important secular leader of the Los von Rom movement. At the Vienna meeting, he along with other Pan-German and Protestant League leaders decided to cooperate in the organization of Los von rom. No evidence exists to suggest that the Protestant League ever reneged on its commitment to cooperate with, indeed support, the Austrian Pan-Germans. p . 225.By 1913, seventy thousand Catholics had converted to Protestantism. p. 227The political decline of Los von Rom was accompanied by Pan-German criticism of its detrimental influence on the fate of the German nation. In 1910, Paul Samassa, a prominent member of the Pan-German League in Germany and perhaps the most important link between Pan-Germans in the empire and in the Dual Monarchy, argued in The Nationality Conflict of the Habsburg State that Los von Rom should have been abandoned as soon as it became evident that the movement could not win over the lower classes. Instead, it had created yet another division among an already torn German nation. Samassa's criticism reflected a growing disenchantment among Pan-German League leaders with the Los von Rom movement. p. 231.The Los von rom faction lost power with the ascendancy of Heinrich Class, who became chairman in 1908. An uncompromising racist, he considered antiultramontanism a disorder of a nationalist ideology grown old. Youth, he maintained, recognized the Jews to be the real enemy of the German people. This idea was shared by a number of integral nationalists in Austria initially sympathetic to Los von Rom, among them Adolf Hitler. In Mein Kampf, Hitler would later criticize the movement for its inability to address the lower classes, for its halfhearted attempt to bring about historical change through the parliamentary system, and for its directing national attention away from the group  that he too believed to be the true enemy of the German people. But even before the outbreak of World War I, these criticisms had become commonplace among Pan-Germans in both empires.  p. 231.//So much of this is both familiar and foreign.  From reading about the Nazi movement, and other sources, I've heard the names mentioned in this section, but I never had the context.  I had always thought of Houston Stewart Chamberlain as a relatively inconsequential racists precursor to the Nazis, but I had no idea that his writings were informed Protestant anti-ultamontanism.  Further, the opposition to ""Political Catholicism"" was a mainstay of the Nazi political program, but it would seems that the tradition of assailing ""Political Catholicism"" was simply a continuation of traditional ""antiultramontanism"" of the Reich.In fact, this book makes Mein Kampf comprehensible.  The opening chapters of Mein Kampf involves Hitler's description of the Catholic church's oppression - in his view of Austrian Germans at the behest of Austrian Slavs - and his praise of Schonerer.  I previously didn't have the context for those passages, but I see now how formative to Hitler, the antiultramontane movement was for his stated political views.In a way, then, this book, and the history it covers, is like a skeleton key for understanding the early Nazi movement, which is necessary for understanding the mature Nazi movement and the dynamics of the Nazi-Catholic relationship.Before I began this book, I had the relatively tentative position that the popular linkage of Catholicism with Nazism, i.e., that Catholics or the Catholic church supported the Nazis, was nonsense because Catholicism was intrinsically non-nationalistic and had an allegiance to someone who was not German.  This book solidifies that view, and therefore is quite worth reading for anyone interested in that subject.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S6KQB3X48WU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691036241#wasThisHelpful","R3S6KQB3X48WU7","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this book under the belief that I would be getting something akin to the Nuremberg trial transcripts, which might offer some insights into the mindset and workings of the Third Reich.What I received was a fantastic story about how Gestapo Chief Heinrich Mueller didn't die in 1945, but instead was recruited by the CIA as part of its anti-Soviet efforts and lived until sometime in the 1980s. The author claims to have the secret files of Mueller which he obtained through means that ""are not necessary for the reader's understanding.""Real history tells us that Mueller died in Berlin in 1945, or, at least, that was when he was last known to have been alive.If I had known the real history, the 1948 interrogation subtitle would have been a red-flag. As it was, I suspected a rat within a few pages when the author began to insinuate that the Final Solution hadn't happened. With that red-flag, I did a quick search and found an article from the Institute for History Review entitled ""Not Quite the Hitler Diaries,"" that spells out the extent of the fraud. [Upon further research it turns out that the Institute for Historical Review is part of the holocaust-denial collective, so take the article with a grain of salt, albeit why a site with a holocaust-denial agenda would blow the whistle on a holocaust-denial forgery is a bit of a conundrum.]I can't see any reason for purchasing this book, unless you are a Holocaust-denying, conspiracy nut.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27HZ6NEFQROB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SGHJ4JW#wasThisHelpful","R27HZ6NEFQROB6","A10ZUMCCLDNPKG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10ZUMCCLDNPKG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a fan of Robert Heinlein, then you will love this movie.  It is based - and stays extremely close to - Heinlein's classic story ""All You Zombies."" I tumbled to the connection in the first few minutes when some of Heinlein's lines were showing up in the movie, but when one character introduced himself as the ""unmarried mother,"" I knew I had to check IMDB. Heinlein purists will love this movie. There are lines right out of the story, and the background has things from the story, such as a jukebox playing ""I'm my own Grandpa."" There also all sorts of clever ""tells"" planted in the movie, which you will spot if you know the story.The movie does extend the story, but not in a way that hurts the message or plot. In fact, the extension is necessary to round out the story from the standpoint of fitting a Hollywood checklist for plot closure (the story being famous for not having closure.)I am not sure that anyone will be surprised by the plot turns, but, then, I read the story a half dozen times before I graduated from high school.The actors sell their roles.

"Here at our house we've been going against the grain (wheat grain, anyway) for about ten years. This review will focus on preparing the Bona Dea Marvelous Muffin Mix vegan, as the instructions list eggs in the steps (but the mix itself is vegan). We used Santa Cruz Peach Applesauce and Garden of Life Organic Ground Flax as our egg substitute.Well, not very good. As my sister commented, you will not want to eat the full dozen yourself, that's for sure. Now we have been gluten-free for many years, and so we have pretty loose standards for what tastes good to us, but this is just not cutting it. Also, the luscious blueberries pictured on the front of the package (and on this product page) might lead you to believe the mix contains blueberries; it does not. The flour mix smells almost rancid, but this is probably the smell of the teff, which is a bit unusual. At least I hope that's the teff. Despite being declared whole-grain, the muffins have just one gram of fiber each (but ten grams of sugar and twenty-seven carbs); however all the grains are organic. So that's nice.In the end, not enough. Not nearly nutritious enough to be called healthy, and they don't taste that good. If nutrition is not a concern and you just want delectable muffins, go with the King Arthur GF muffin mix, or if you want a bit cleaner ingredients try out the Cravings Place mix. The Bona Dea mix falls far short of both the tasty and the healthy mark and rates:GRADE: CNOTE: For comparison's sake, we prepared a second batch, this time following the exact instructions on the package, which have you use eggs. The results were better tasting, but still less than stellar (There's this strange aftertaste that persists in both versions. It seems to be the baking powder, not the grains themselves.).

"There are many remedies for a tummy that's feeling poorly, and Mastic Gum is one of the more interesting and time-tested on the long list. This review will focus less on the medicinal effects of the gum in general and more on this specific product, compared to other mastic supplements on the market (although anyone and everyone who suffers from a H. Pylori infection should check out a landmark study done on Mastic Gum in 1998 and published by the New England Journal of Medicine).Generally, I like Jarrow products, although sometimes their additives and fillers leave much to be desired. This Mastic Gum has that almost indefinable grassy/root smell, and is dosed at 500 mg per capsule. They use magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide as fillers; far less desirable than the MCT oil (usually from coconut) some companies are now using instead for other kinds of supplement formulations. However, so far every brand making mastic gum uses magnesium steareate as at least one of the excipients, so you are stuck with it if you choose mastic gum as a treatment.We're starting to see fillers disappear from many higher-end supplement brands (like Renew Life and Enzymedica) as brands catch on that consumers would rather have just the supplement and not powdered plastics, cheap oils, or whitening agents along with it.

"This vegan protein leaves a lot to be desired. We are big on daily workouts here at my house, and so we always have half a dozen protein powders around for a a quick post-workout snack. How does this one compare to other vegan options? Some points of interest:--First of all, the full retail on this protein is outrageous. The ingredients are not organic, and carrageenan, a notorious gut-irritant used as an emulsifier, is the second ingredient on the list. At full price this is more expensive per serving than the Vega Sport Protein, which is considered quite pricey and is made from a similar blend of plan proteins.--The amino-acid content, very important information, is listed on this Amazon webpage. That's awesome, because it's not on the package. If you were to buy this in a store, you would have no way of evaluating the BCAA content in the moment. A weird oversight.--The package proudly calls out ""No Sugar"", which is great, but the same cannot be said for sodium. Each scoop contains a whopping 540 mg of sodium. Compare that to Vega's ""Protein and Greens"" blend, which has much more nutrition, is cheaper per serving, and only contains 180 mg for roughly the same serving size. Obviously athletes do have different sodium needs than non-athletes, but 540 mg seems excessive, even if is from sea salt.--Since carrageenan is the second ingredient, there is probably very little rice and hemp protein in this product. Another indicator is the poor vitamin and mineral content; brown rice protein has a lot of naturally occurring iron, and this protein has 0% of your RDA for that nutrient.In conclusion, a sham. You can get organic, better-quality for proteins for less per serving very easily. You're basically paying for the Everlast name here. My personal fav of all the vegan proteins is Ojio's Sprouted Brown Rice protein: The sprouting process jacks up the amino acid content, the nutrients are higher, it's certified organic, and if you shop around you can get it cheaper per serving than this product.Problematic at best and rating:GRADE: C-/D","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYEUZ8E1I3JSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQ1C7VQ#wasThisHelpful","RYEUZ8E1I3JSE","A2BD0G4SRK0WMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD0G4SRK0WMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So said the great violinist Yehudi Menuhin. Of course, if you want to get all that you will need good earphones. I love these earphones. They fit my ears perfectly, I love the sound, and I love the bells and whistles. They will be a misery for the wrong person, however. Some points of interest:THE FIT: I have a smaller head (I am 5' 7) and the ear hooks fit like a glove. Larger ears? You are going to be in trouble, as several reviewers note.The Apple compatible version of these phones have a lop-sided cord, with one side being much longer than the other. Sennheiser says Apple made them do it that way. It doesn't bother me at all, personally. The cord is supposed to be ""tangle-free""; well, mostly. Mine is a bit tangled. To be fair, I am a notorious tangler of cords, with some headphones so tangled I am in danger of choking myself to death as I walk down the street. I wish I was kidding. The only truly tangle-free cord I have ever used was for these ear-buds:Phiaton MS 100 BA Balanced Armature Earphones with Mic. It was kind of amazing, the only really amazing thing about them.THE SOUND: Like all good headphones/speakers, these ear phones need to be broken in for the best sound quality. My brother, who is autistic and absurdly picky about his audio equipment, recommends breaking in ear phones of this range and quality by plugging them into your computer and playing music at full volume for one full day (don't have them on when you do that!). These mellowed out nicely for me in a short time. If you are very choosy about sound, this product is not a good idea, as the highs are a bit tinny. But for my taste, the sound was adequate.THE ANTI-BACTERIAL TREATMENT: This actually freaked me out at first (I didn't notice the feature when I ordered them), because I don't trust companies not to spray their products down with some sort of horrible toxin and poison me. It's the world we live in.  Some research revealed that the anti-bacterial element is a silver ion treatment, similar to silver applications in hospitals. The company who makes it (Steri-Touch) states that the silver is non-nano. So I feel a bit better about that.QUALITY: These look study and well-made, however I am aware that some reviewers had their phones break after a short time. I've been using these nearly everyday for about a month with no quality problems at all, but a month is not a long time. At this price they should last years, and I will report back if I experience quality issues down the road.These earphones are compatible with my old, dinky, non-Apple MP3 player (though the on-cord volume control does not work) and my Toshiba computer. They come with extra ear-buds and a nifty pouch (worlds better that the bag that came with the aforementioned Phiaton buds) that has a Velcro closure.In conclusion, recommended. Yes, you can get higher-quality sound, especially if you're willing to pay a lot more. And yes, you need to have smaller ears or you run the risk of a bad fit. But for me, for the reasons above, a perfect fit and so 4.5 stars, which we'll round up to five for Amazon purposes, and rating:GRADE: A-","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N03W7BRJVZH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRRTOC2#wasThisHelpful","R1N03W7BRJVZH4","A2BD0G4SRK0WMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD0G4SRK0WMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If like Katherine you have paired down your beauty regime down to the essentials, consider this lip balm. I decided to post a review for it when I saw there weren't any yet, because it has a weird property worth knowing about: It doubles as a bug-bite balm. The nice folks at Badger mentioned this facet to me when I got one, and a couple of days ago I also got my first mosquito bite of the summer. Surprisingly, applying this balm really took down the itching dramatically. Since Burt's Bees is no longer making their beloved Bite Balm, this is a nice substitute.The Tea Tree and Lemon Balm are there to help heal cold sores or other such issues, and the cocoa butter gives you some added softness and protection against the elements. I don't understand the current price of $10 for the balm, as it is about $5 at any natural foods store. I've giving it five stars as a product, because it works so well as a balm, cold sore healer, and bug bite soother.

"I like these. Yes the concept is silly, but at my house we do not use paper towels to clean up messes (unless the messes are a total bio-hazard or something) and I often need just a small scrap to use as a napkin or to pat down meat before cooking or whatever. And they are kinda cute.The Sparkle Mini Rolls are currently unavailable (bad sign), so I can't give you buyers a price comparison to regular paper towels, but they certainly wouldn't be worth more just because they are petite. I am deducting one star based on other reviewers who said the price differences weren't favorable, but otherwise I am very happy with the quality and I admit, the concept.

"Do the Kimberly-Clark towel-dispensers have to be so ugly? They're ubiquitous across the U.S.; in insurance offices and doctor's offices and now at my house for some reason, and man they are ugly. Surely it would cost no more to mold the plastic in a shape less reminiscent of a Communist Regime. As for the towels themselves, they are perfectly fine, decently made and will get your hands dry. I am rating the product three stars because in order to use these towels as they were intended you have to have a hideous dispenser, and you will break a nail getting it open to load your towels (it is a fact.).We, the hapless insurance buyers and patients of doctors and denizens of my house, should demand better.

"This is a 4.5 star review rounded up to five for Amazon. The Aroma Digital Kettle has some small design flaws, but nothing major and the kettle is a very good deal for the performance. This review will directly compare the Russell Hobbs KE9000S Electric Kettle, Stainless Steel, which right now on sale is exactly the same price. Details as follows:SET-UP: Much easier than many kettles (including the Hobbs) which you to have to treat the pot with vinegar and let it sit for hours before the first use. The Aroma kettle only requires a light water rinse and you're ready to rock. The kettle is sturdy and well-built, but be advised the cord is a bit on the short side. If your desired location is more than two feet away from an outlet you might want to look elsewhere.PERFORMANCE/USE: I love the easily adjustable water temps that allow you to more precisely brew different kinds of tea (higher temps for black tea, lower for white, etc.). I would say this kettle is ideal for the more serious tea-drinker, as it comes with a recommended temperature list for different beverages (printed on a slip of paper; it would have been infinitely better to etch it on the kettle itself). RE: The water line. Why do these kettle companies make the water level marker so hard to read? Both the Hobbs kettle and this one suffer from the same dumb problem. There needs to be a mark line INSIDE the kettle since you can't  pour water and watch the water line at the same time. It's easy to over shoot.This isn't a lightening-fast kettle; full 212 degree water takes 8 minutes when the kettle is at the max line.I like the easily removable filter on the spout that keeps out sediment from your beverage. Nice.SAFETY: I really like how the lid on the unit locks shut, preventing scalding or spills. The temperature display at the top lets you know how hot the water inside is in case you have multiple people using the kettle and not communicating what they've been doing (it happens). If you overfill the kettle you do risk boiling water coming up the spout.PRICE: Is it worth double the price for a digital kettle? To me, yes. We brew about 14 cups of tea a day, and rotate between all types of tea and teasans, so I really appreciate the temp controls. The Aroma has held up to heavy use very well so far. This is superior to the Hobbs kettle, and I do recommend it. You might be able to find it in the forty dollar range if you shop around or wait for a better sale, and I would say grab it at that price.The only real flaw is that hard-to-read while pouring water line, and it's relatively minor, so I've comfortable rounding the star rating to five (we gave the Hobbs kettle four). Happy tea-drinking! (Or oatmeal-making, as the case may be.)GRADE: B+/A-","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EBNM7W5VSSKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY2NDAE#wasThisHelpful","R1EBNM7W5VSSKU","A2BD0G4SRK0WMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD0G4SRK0WMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a ViewSonic projector ViewSonic PJD6383S XGA 1024x768 DLP Projector, 3000 ANSI Lumens, 15,000:1 Contrast Ratio, 120Hz/3D-Ready- Black which is no longer being produced by ViewSonic. When the bulb started going out, I called them and asked which lamp to order as a replacement, and they said to get this one (which at the time was selling for $329). They informed me that this model lamp will last for 22,000 hours.Installation I would put at a medium-level difficulty, perhaps out of the range of most people without technical experience in this field. If you have projectors littering your living room floor like confetti and work with this type of equipment every day (like my brother does), then you'll be fine, but if this is your first time changing out a projector lamp here are some tips:--Have two people on the job--Block out at least an hour--The instructions for replacing the lamp are in the digital manual, which you can download at viewsonic.com. Just paste in your projector model #, then go to ""downloads"" on the navigation bar under the product image, then scroll down to the User Guide.--You have to unscrew the top of projector (very small screws), and because my partner in crime is a former contractor, we happened to have a tiny screwdriver in the house. There is one more screw to undo on the inside. You then lift up the old lamp by the metal handle VERY slowly (or the glass will shatter). The lamp is plugged in at one side and can be hard to disengage gently, but we did our best and the lamp did not break on us. You then insert the new lamp (without touching the optics underneath), screw everything back in as directed, and once the projector is back on you reset the lamp hours from the menu display. The instructions talk about a ""film"" you replace with the lamp; we have no idea what they are talking about. The foil panel on the top of the lid? If so, a new one did not come with our replacement lamp, but the old one looked perfect so we left it as is.That's it; hopefully this helps some of you out. I wish I'd known more about the whole thing before I started, but if worse comes to worse you can always call ViewSonic and make them walk you through the process. They informed us they will be producing these replacement lamps (which fit a couple of models) for five more years. Then we're on our own.Hard to come up with a star rating, but the picture is bright and perfect, it was only the installation we found unpleasant. So four stars for now, and we will update if the lamp doesn't last the full 20,000+ hours. On projector is on 8 hours a day, so this should last a few years.GRADE: B","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RACS5JCLRXQFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BREE93M#wasThisHelpful","RACS5JCLRXQFE","A2BD0G4SRK0WMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD0G4SRK0WMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted to compare this zester/grater to the best-selling Microplane 40020 Classic zester/grater, which I own and is slightly cheaper. Here's how they stack up:The OXO has a wide zesting/grating surface, which is great if you're zesting over a large bowl for a recipe but messy if you're trying to accent a dish. It also has no side-catch for shavings, like the Mircoplane. They both have stainless steel blades and zest citrus and chocolate with ease, and both can be put in the dishwasher. I do recommend the Microplane over the OXO because of the side walls that catch your shavings and smaller grating surface. But I use zest and shavings mostly as a garnish; if you are zesting large amounts of citrus for recipes you might want this product instead.OXO Zester Features:--PVC-free packaging and handle is BPA-free--Dishwasher safe (top rack)--Large handle easy on achy hands and wrists (a frequent feature of OXO products)GRADE: B","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HYHYH6HM5895/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VLYQGS#wasThisHelpful","R2HYHYH6HM5895","A2BD0G4SRK0WMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD0G4SRK0WMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That's true, now more than ever. Since today you can alter and toy with photos in a dizzying amount of ways, maybe it's time to get a printer that can do more for your photography. Is this a good choice? Read on!SET UP/ASSEMBLY: Unlike some reviewers, I did not think set up was simple. It really depends on the kind of printers you have been used to--since I normally review office equipment the CANON PIXMA is the first printer especially designed for photos that I've owned (if you don't count my Epson printer, which is older but great with photo printing.). From the ink installation to the paper trays, a lot is different and it took me about 2 hours to complete the installation and registration (more on that in a minute). The LAN connection set-up had me running between the floors of my house to activate the access point on my modem so the printer and my computer could enjoy harmonious matrimony. No printer installation I've done has been so complicated, but they do walk you through it step by slow step, and if you can't get the LAN wireless connection up you do have the option to use a USB cable. Naturally, they don't provide one.APPEARANCE/USAGE: This is one pretty printer. Sitting next to my oafish HP Officejet Pro the CANON PIXMA is definitely a tearing beauty in comparison. The compartments are sleek and elegant, and the touchscreen gorgeous. Looks-wise, I've never seen a more fetching product. Great design, and well-made. Navigating between functions is easy and intuitive, and as a basic everyday product highly recommended, especially at the reasonable price. The printer comes with a tiny pack of 4""x 6"" photo paper so be sure to have more on hand if you want to start on a project right away. The colors on my test projects were vibrant and all you could ask for outside a professional-grade unit.A quick list of considerations/perks/problems:--You will be forced to register the product if you want to use many of the online functions, like the Easy Photo Print+. Have your serial # (it's on the backside of the unit) and date of purchase ready.--After set-up you will be asked if CANON can track your every move for R&D purposes. I have not had a printer in the last four years from any brand that did not try to pull this, but at least HP offered me a bribe (or as they put it, a ""prize"". A mystery one!). CANON's legal-speak accompanying their request for data contained this gem: ""The above information will be sent to Canon through the internet every month for ten years. The internet connection fee shall be borne by you."" They're using my connection for their R&D? I think not.--If you use CANON ink, you get access to ""Creative Park Premium"", where you can print out origami or make cards for your relatives or stationary for Junior or whatever. I highly recommend looking through the available images; some are really strange. My personal favorite is the one with the flight attendant thanking the passenger for being in her life. Or maybe the passenger is thanking her. It's hard to tell.--No thumb drive insert; you have to use a memory card or USB cable if you need to physically load images onto the printer. Bummer.--Though marketed as ""All-in-One"", this printer does not include a fax. I know faxing is on it's way out the door, but I still sometimes have to send a fax, particularly when signed documents are requested. Some places won't take an emailed scan of a signed document, but will accept a fax. Happens to me a couple times a year.The long set-up and arrogant data request kinda rubbed me the wrong way, so I'm deducting 1/2 star for that. That leaves us at 4.5 stars, which I will be updating as I use more functions. This is a very good buy for a printer that does a LOT of things.

"A great pair of headphones is like a gift, especially if you love music. This review will focus on the sound depth and quality of the Turtle Beach Stealth 500X Headset, particularly while listening to music or other audio. In my opinion, at this price a headset should be able to pull double duty.NOTE: According to Turtle Beach, this headset's wireless feature is ONLY compatible with the XBox One. I know that is obvious to many of you, but for those Amazon customers who do not frequently use gaming headsets or are looking for a gift for someone else, beware.You may have noted that the Sleath 500X Wireless headsets have polarized reviewers on Amazon. I do agree that they are overpriced by about 50%, but they have their good points. They are comfortable if a touch heavy for all-day use (I have been wearing them for hours at a time the last few days), they're sturdy, and not ugly (though not the coolest brand I've seen). Since other reviewers have focused on the Xbox One gaming experience, I'll talk a little about using the headsets for music or PC gaming, comparing them to a few other brands of headphones/headsets.My brother, who is autistic and a die-hard audiophile, is disdainful of Turtle Beach products; only once has he given one of their headsets a passing review (surprisingly, one of their cheapest models.). Still, he hasn't tried this wireless model and was a touch jealous when I told him I had one. His headphone brand of choice while gaming is Sennheiser, and if we're talking about listening to music tracks side by side with both brands even I can tell Sennheiser has superior sound quality. I tried out ""What Are You Going to Do, Save the Whole World?"" from the ""Man of Steel"" Soundtrack and ""Flynn Lives"" from the ""TRON"" soundtrack with first my Sennheiser headphones and the then Turtle Beach headset, and there is no comparison. The depth and richness of the former gave me chills, and the Stealth sounded tinny in contrast. Top-of-the line Sennheiser gaming sets run a bit more than the Stealth 500X, but the average customer review is currently higher. You might want to check it out, unless you are really big on the wireless feature. When it comes to straight music, the Turtle Beach 500X was barely better than my Tribeca headphones, and those are only around $50 a pair.A few other considerations/observations:--The mic turns itself off after a while if you don't speak into it; annoying. However, I loved how well you can hear yourself and the mic worked very well when I played an online game that requires me to both hear myself and be clearly recognized by the computer.--The Amazon page touts ""Up to 15 hours"" of use before a charge is needed, but Turtle Beach's own site states these phones last 10 hours before needing a charge.--I really hate it when the technical support on a product doesn't allow you to call the company. Bad sign. If you need help with these sets and go to the website, you will have to fill out a long form and submit it while waiting a full business day for an answer. It would take you 1/5 the time to just tell someone over the phone all the information they make you type out, but that would save your time, not theirs. I have deducted a half star just for the poor technical support set-up.All in all, not bad. No real big complaints; if the tech support was better designed and the sets were half the price, I would probably rate it five stars. As it is, for this price you might want to weigh other choices.GRADE: B","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34T97DSS22UMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSQACMM#wasThisHelpful","R34T97DSS22UMO","A2BD0G4SRK0WMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD0G4SRK0WMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You may not need to change your shirt every day, but you definitely need to clean your teeth. This is the third Philips Sonicare Powerup I've owned and the fifth Sonicare product I've tried out. I absolutely love the Powerup; it's affordable, works excellently, and has very few drawbacks.I got my first Powerup a year ago and have yet to change the battery. The handles of these brushes do pick up stains (like makeup) easily, but I don't care much about that. Though the Powerup does rattle your head a bit, I found that by going down one degree in brush firmness (from my regular medium bristle to soft bristle) this effect is diminished somewhat. My Sonicare DiamondClean, which is more than twelve times the price of the Powerup, died on me after two years and has resisted all attempts at resurrection. Not cool. Plus, refills on the Powerup will cost you about $3.50 per brush head (as of right now), as opposed to $10-$12 each for the DiamondClean.The product comes with batteries (yay) in the package and is ready to go. Though you don't get a choice of speeds, a carrying case, a cup, or any other bells and whistles, I don't think you really need them.

"This is an odd movie. It's odd, and it's the kind of odd that seems to be purely unintentional. Ostensibly a bright, sunny update of the Cinderella fable, ""Irene"" has many famous, talented faces (Billie Burke, Arthur Treacher, Roland Young, and mama pajama Dorothy Dandridge, hanging out of a window sill) but doesn't give them anything to do, good source material and solid dialogue but an underdeveloped narrative, and ultimately a poor choice for the female lead that a great choice for the male one can't overcome.Anna Neagle is the titular Irene; decent, pretty, hard-working, sensible, and Irish as the Gaeilge. While measuring upholstery in a rich family's house she is spotted by Ray Milland, who takes an instant shine to her and helps her land a job at ""Madame Lucy's"", a hoity toity couture house that he has pull with. His pull turns out be that he IS Madame Lucy. There's a ball, lots of dancing, romantic mix-ups, an accident involving Irish stew, some banal singing, and LOTS of satin and lace before everything is resolved in a perfectly uninspired manner.""Irene"" was based on a long-running stage hit that featured no less than three huge stars in turn (Irene Dunne, Jeanette McDonald, and in a revival Debbie Reynolds), any one of which could have played the role better than Anna Neagle. Neagle was actually British, and a very big star in post-war Britain. She seems nice, but she can't really sing, she can't really dance, and worst of all she has no chemistry with Milland. He tries his best (and his best is pretty great), but without chemistry between the leads the romance has no steam and the story no traction. We have great actors assembled but the script doesn't give them any good characters to play (Dandridge gets about twenty seconds of screen time), there are no real laughs, and the plot is wafer-thin. All that can be said for the film is that the clothes are fun. And that's it.Harmless, not really boring, but a missed opportunity and not worth Warner Brothers' asking price. Recommended only for the most rabid of Milland fans, and rating:GRADE: B-While watching Neagle's solo ""dance"" sequence, my Dad kindly suggested that maybe her dancing was good for her ""era"". The era of Ginger Rogers, Vera Ellen and Ann Miller?No, it wasn't.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LAOWMDJG63L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVFRLCU#wasThisHelpful","R2LAOWMDJG63L2","A2BD0G4SRK0WMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD0G4SRK0WMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you too want breakfast any time in a short time, you might want this toaster oven. This is the first toaster oven I've ever owned. In a house full of food allergies and diabetics, we just don't eat much processed or packaged food (or toast, for that matter). But having been warmly assured by my Aunt that once I tried a toaster oven I would never use my actual oven again or be happy with anything else, I decided it was time to give this appliance a whirl.SET UP/APPEARANCE: Ready to go right outside of the package. A nice-looking toaster oven, actually as nice-looking as ovens at much higher price points.INSTRUCTIONS: If somehow you have escaped knowing how to use a toaster oven and so have to actually read the instructions (like me), you have the option of perusing the quick start guide or the full manual (about two pages). I enjoyed the many warnings, such as not using the oven as a toy chest, not using it as a shelf, not using it outdoors, not using it to run your own restaurant, basically not using it in any way shape or form that could be considered creative. There are some contradictions in the manual about preheat times (they tell you to preheat the broiler for 10 minutes, then two lines later tell you to do it for 5), but mostly the instructions are straightforward and easy to understand. They do tell you not to cover any part of the oven with foil (which everyone told me to do to make clean-up easier) as this causes the oven to get too hot. Being a very rule-oriented person, I will follow Black and Decker's admonition, in this regard, anyway (see next item).USE: The timer is analog instead of digital, and you can only turn it up to 30 minutes max (though there is a ""Leave On"" setting for longer jobs--just don't forget it!) We tested a variety of projects, as detailed below:For toasting: While my test toast turned out terrific (ha!) it did take a LONG time in comparison with my regular toaster. This toaster oven could replace your toaster if you have counter space issues, but be advised it isn't fast. I would say you will need a little less than double your normal toasting time. For heating up frozen food: I cooked up a veggie patty, which un-thawed and warmed up in 10 minutes. I did not preheat, because, um, Black and Decker is not the boss of me. Actually it was because I didn't want to wait. My patty did not stick to the oven tray, which was awesome.For baking, in the sense of actual cooking: I whipped up some basic biscuits to see how the unit handles simple baking jobs. The toaster oven gets very hot to the touch (hence the warning about not using it as a shelf) and the 30 minute timer limit is a drawback, but my biscuits came out flaky and tasty, if a trifle late. I would say I needed an additional 20 minutes of baking time, probably due to heat leakage from the unit.Broiling: Best feature. Food was nicely browned and fast. As good as my oven, actually.Conclusion: A serviceable toaster for an extremely reasonable price. I am giving this 4 stars, with the biggest plus being the price point. It is not the best toaster oven out there. It takes longer to toast bread than a toaster and longer to bake biscuits than an oven. It gets very hot on the top and only has a 30 minute timer. But it is very affordable, attractive, and compact. So four stars for a toaster oven under $30, not for the entire toaster oven category. If you throw out the price considerations, I would give it 3.5 stars.So my Aunt was wrong; I won't be replacing my toaster or oven with this baby anytime soon. I'm not going to tell her though. Not a bad product, and useful in its way. For this price I don't think you could do much better, and so rating:GRADE: B+NOTE: Burning yourself is very easy to do with this oven, because the heating tray gets scorching hot. Play safe out there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JLQJAH76V9A6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FN3MV88#wasThisHelpful","R3JLQJAH76V9A6","A2BD0G4SRK0WMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD0G4SRK0WMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Buy this. If you love classic film, buy this DVD. That's the short of it. Here's the long of it: When you love old movies, there comes a time when you've watched and re-watched all the famous ones. After that, you embark on one long treasure hunt to uncover hidden gems. ""After Office Hours"" is a certified forgotten gem. Ignore the boring, generic title and be prepared for a film with top-notch one liners (screenplay by Herman J. Mankiewicz--how is this not a famous movie?), gorgeous people (Debate: Who is more beautiful, Clark Gable or Constance Bennett?) incredible clothes (RE: Bennett's silk dress in the night club scene. How DID they keep it from wrinkling?), an excellent, suspenseful plot, lots of beloved character actors (William Demarest as a cop, a flash of Margaret Dumont, and the delightful Billie Burke in a perfect, perfect role for her) but mostly, glorious fun from beginning to end.Clark Gable is a newspaper editor (naturally) and Bennett his new and well-connected music critic. He fires her over her high-brow taste, only to learn she is friends with a circle of people Gable has been trying to pin a scandal story on for months. He rethinks his choices, they spar (a lot), there's a murder, some suspense, gowns are worn, faces are slapped, Gable gets beat up, Gable beats up others, Billie Burke is adorable, Gable is sexy, and it all ends exactly as it should. My only complaint is that at 72 minutes ""After Office Hours"" is far too short, though as you can imagine at that length the pace is lightning.I am so happy I saw this and so happy it is available for burn-on demand (so many terrific films still are not) and so happy I can share it with Amazon readers. Is it worth the very high burn-on demand price? If you love Gable or Bennett, or Hollywood glamour in the 1930's, then yes. Very much worth buying at least used for any film fan and rating:GRADE: A(Favorite line in a movie brimming with good ones: Bennett orders Gable out of her car and tells him to walk home.

"Berra's right, as usual. I'm going to kick off this review by addressing the issue that was of biggest concern to me when I got this DeLonghi Radiator: The offgassing when the heater is first used. Many other reviewers noted a strong smell from the unit when it is initially fired up; some reviewers complained of the smell never getting better. This is a huge issue to me as I have several people with fragile health in my house and certainly don't want to poison a family member with a defective heater. So did our unit offgass?Yes, for the first half hour or so, VERY strongly. We had to put the heater outside. The smell diminished rapidly after that first 30 minutes, and after the first day or so the scent was and is only detectable if you lean up right next to the radiator when it is going full blast. It's kind of a burnt metal smell. I find this acceptable, and so am recommending the product, with slight reservations. If you are very chemically sensitive, you may want to keep looking.Other than this issue, a very good heater. We are using it to warm up a kitchen/living room area, and I am very pleased with the results. The unit is super easy to use and understand (with one exception, noted below), the controls mostly intuitive and the manual simple. I love the antifreeze setting, which you can use if you have a small living space, are traveling, and are worried about your pipes freezing. The highest setting got our desired space nice and toasty, without me having to heat up both floors of our house.The exception to the radiator's simplicity is the ""timer"", which is bizarre and unlike anything else I've ever used. It involves setting red knobs in 15-minute increments using what for all the world appears to be military-time. A digital timer would have been too much trouble, apparently. One star total deducted for the weird timer and the initial strong smell as you're breaking your radiator in.Other than that, recommended. For $18 you can buy an extended warranty to protect your unit beyond the manufacturer's two-year limit. Doesn't really seem worth it me, as shipping this thing would cost you a bundle. The Delonghi is a reasonable price and we're happy with it, and so rates:GRADE: B","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PW20AVUTUU5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A33B1C#wasThisHelpful","R3PW20AVUTUU5L","A2BD0G4SRK0WMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD0G4SRK0WMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ultra comfy, plush, cushy and squishy bath mat is SO much better than I expected for the modest price. I love it. The color on the web page is true; a very vanilla coffee-cream shade.

"I guess it's subjective, since I noticed several reviewers don't like the texture or feel of the popcorn bath mat. But I found it so thick and nice and the texture is so comfortable underfoot -- like a foot massage -- I decided to use it as a bedside rug instead of in the bath.

"This little guy is amazing.  It's a capable and accurate thermal imager, as well as a decent flashlight.  My primary interest was to see if it would be good with diagnostics.  You can check the wiring in your home to see if there are any hotspots, or find out if your climate control system has any major areas that it's leaking.  One of these units could potentially save you thousands in the long run if you use it properly.But I found the most important reason to have one: It's really fun :DIt's a sleek device - it's light, small and comfortable in the hand.  The buttons are rubberized and easy to activate, and the menu, although clunkier than a touchscreen smartphone, is intuitive and simple to navigate.  The dust cover over the USB port and MicroSD is a nice touch.  If I do have a complaint, it's that the MicroSD card is very difficult to remove without tweezers.  When you depress it a spring pops it out but not far enough to clear the edge of the channel, and the plastic wall is only about 1mm away from the card making it hard to grasp with a fingernail.  Not something that bothers me for my purposes, as I don't intend to take many snapshots with it.Not sure of it's effective range, but I've pointed it out in the back yard at night and seen a whole host of critters (mostly kitty cats) running around out there from at least 30 feet away.  It's sensitive enough to pick up foot prints on our tile floors (barefoot) up to a few minutes after you walk there.  The different modes make it easier to see heat signatures in different conditions.  There's a Black and White setting that almost works like night vision - you can make out the shapes of objects in the dark from quite far away just by the different surface temperatures - pretty cool.I think my most practical use now will be for travel.  I travel a ton and I'll have this in my EDC backpack for when I'm in strange cities alone.  You can scan dark areas before entering into them, also you can use it to identify if there is anything nearby you need to run from if you are camping and you hear something rustling outside your tent.  This is also where the flashlight comes in handy.  If something looks suspicious on cam you can light it up to verify.  Or you can choose to not do that and avoid giving away your position if you want to avoid potential trouble.It's functional, sleek and SUPER cool.

"This toaster has a great retro style and color, and works really well too. I noticed other reviewers have reported that it is slow due to having ceramic heating elements instead of wire, but the one we received toasts just as fast as a conventional toaster.I was a little confused that you can't just lift the side lever to stop toasting. But all you need do is press the ""cancel"" button in the middle of the light/dark dial on the front. I was also puzzled that there were three buttons on the front -- ""defrost,"" ""reheat,"" and ""bagel"" -- but no ""toast"" button. Turns out it toasts by default. Just set the shade you want and push the lever down and away it goes.The instruction book has a series of pictures of shades of toast along the number settings. It's pretty accurate. Our first try resulted in a very close match in shade. The window really comes in handy for getting toast just the way you like it.The red outer shell is plastic, not metal, in case you're wondering. It wipes clean easily. It has a slide-out crumb tray, and the window is removable for washing. So it can be kept sparkling.It's a little large because it's end-to-end instead of side-by-side.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R296HFYKS4GEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGCKZNE#wasThisHelpful","R296HFYKS4GEN","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This phone takes a little tweaking, but for the market price this thing is really awesome.  Here are the features I really liked:  Long Battery Life  Dual Sim Cards  awesome for travelers or if you live or work somewhere rural with little service  MicroSD slot  getting rarer these days  Sleek and Snappy response  Camera Flash and Front Facing cam (rare in phones in this price range)  Android 4.4.4  though not the latest, it is still an awesome OSThings I didn't care for:  Any application that starts with Acer  Its not upgradeable to Lollipop (5.0) without custom ROM (not many available)  Screen resolution is limited  though not bad for a budget phone  The Acer launcher is a total piece of junkThe reason I give this little communicator 5 stars is because with a little tweaking, this phone is absolutely stellar.  The first thing I did was replace the launcher with Nova Prime, hid all of the factory Acer apps in a folder in the drawer, and changed all of the default apps to Googles System Apps or ones that I prefer.  Then I disabled the Acer Widgets on the lock screen and got rid of the cheesy animations.  Then I added a bunch of games with unicorns and candy and stuff and I gave it to my Mom, who absolutely loves it (after I taught her how to use it :P).  It runs really well as long as you get rid of everything you dont need.For this price range, I highly recommend this as an entry level phone or for someone who only uses it on occasionally to send me a text of a funny cat video or emails me to come fix her computer or gossip about my Aunts.

"I'm using this controller to play Steam games  its wired and came with a 10 ft USB cable so that made it an easy decision.  I dont have a use for most of the functions, even though its incredibly capable and I gave all of them a test drive.The learning curve for using the features is a little steep at first, but I got used to programming it pretty quickly.  First off the customizable prismatic pipe color is really awesome.  It will lock to basically any neon color in the spectrum, so I was able to make it match my shoes, desktop, or whatever gaming interface I was using at the time.  You can also map the multiwheels under the controller to different functions, which I found convenient in more complex RPGs.  You can also customize the rumble feature and the led lights on the inside of the controller.The software works independently of the XBOX ONE, so I was able to manipulate the functions of it as long as it was plugged in.The aesthetics of this thing are really great  as far as the function goes its stellar, as well.  The triggers feel a little springier and cheaper than the standard XBOX ONE controllers, but I got used to them pretty quickly.  Once this thing is plugged in it looks really radical, and I wasn't having any troubles with lag  all the buttons and the analog sticks are super responsive and swift.I like this controller a lot  Ill definitely be hanging on to it for my PC gaming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CH8R30BGZ58D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJRHSRW#wasThisHelpful","R2CH8R30BGZ58D","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good for the price. They don't enclose your ears, they rest on them. They're certainly not noise canceling. Sound quality is okay, a bit strong in the mid range, perhaps a tiny bit muddy, but clear enough. Don't expect overly impressive bass response and you won't be disappointed.They fold up compactly, a nice plus, and so is the in-line volume control.

"I really like this case.  I've been carrying on my Galaxy S6 since I got it.  The only time I take it off is to put the phone in an extended battery case on days when I'm going to be away from home for awhile.The fit is excellent.  Instead of a 2 piece like the Defender or Commuter OtterBoxes, this is a single piece, slip on case.  It quickly accommodates the phone and grips it snugly.  The buttons are covered by a dense rubber, but still quite functional.  The headphone, power port and speaker are each recessed deeply by the case, but any standard headphone or power plug should fit it fine because the holes are flared quite wide to accommodate your accessories.  I don't have a dock, but I imagine fitting into one could be difficult.  There are no dust or moisture covers for the ports.The form is fantastic.  This case looks super stylish.  I have the blue one with clear backing, and with a deep blue galaxy (space blue or whatever it's called) it looks great.  It's kind of like a Tron theme.  I imagine it would look awesome on the white model, as well.The function is absolutely brilliant.  The case holds the phone very snugly.  I have a range of cases and this is the one that I feel gives the best shock protection.  It also has the most effective screen recession.  I like this case a lot.There is one major drawback and it's specific to the ROYAL CRYSTAL model.  The plastic on the outside is super durable, but on the INSIDE not so much.  I put the phone in by the base and it was about an inch high so I slid it down to the bottom and it SCRATCHED the entire bottom inch of the inside of the case (the flat clear plastic part).  The glass edge on the bottom of my S6 was too much for this thing.  It's now super scuffed, and I couldn't believe how little force it took.  I did the same thing again with the corner of the phone in the already scratched area - I only used the weight of the phone and dragged it along the surface about a quarter of an inch - and it left a DEEP gouge in the plastic.That being said, I think it's an oversight and not enough to kill my review.  I still love the case and I'll be looking to get one that's not crystal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROZ9N2F8HFRCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X53T456#wasThisHelpful","ROZ9N2F8HFRCA","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No batteries needed.I'm deducting a star because the actual Slinky Dog we received doesn't look as happy as the one in the photos. The corners of its mouth don't turn up. It looks happy from the front when it's posed on its haunches and its head is up.

"Great fragrance, goes on smoothly, no orange ""fake and bake"" look, and I love that you can build up to the tone you want over several days instead of going too far with one application. The color develops slowly, so some patience is required. In other words, no need to reapply if you're not seeing color in minutes. Wait a day then reapply if desired.As other reviewers pointed out, gloves are a good idea so you don't accidentally tan your palms. And do extra rubbing to make sure it's evenly applied, and not too heavy on the knees and elbows.Great natural looking results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE1UZI57H0SDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFEFEAC#wasThisHelpful","RE1UZI57H0SDQ","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Strong masculine fragrance that smells even better once it's on -- and not quite as strong, which is a good thing. The citrus and cedar and spice aromas are forefront, with leather following. I couldn't detect the advertised tobacco notes.From the description I expected a bit more of a barbershop fragrance, but it's more library in tone.

"Some retinol-containing products are just too strong and cause a rash or irritation, but this product is mild enough for me to use.You pour the contents of one of the bottles over a stack of pads in a jar. Then wipe your face with a pad in the evening, and leave the product on overnight. I saw nice results -- smoother skin -- within just a few days. A set of ""charged"" pads should be used up within 30 days. There's a 90-day supply (three bottles of product and 90 pads) in this kit.I'm not sure all the additional botanical extracts (cucumber, chamomile, green tea, aloe) contribute anything but a little sizzle to the steak. And some people are sensitive to them. Also, retinol products increase sun sensitivity, so sunscreen or other protection from sun is recommended while using them.Note that this is being marketed as a cosmetic to improve skin appearance (minimize pores, smooth imperfections, etc.). As to the price point and whether it's worth it -- over 60 dollars for a 90-day supply -- well that's just going to be something for individuals to decide for themselves.

"I normally wire my pedal board with George L's. I was skeptical about this D'Addario cable set until I opened the package and saw and felt the quality.First of all, the cable is thicker -- heavier gauge -- than George Ls. The right-angle plugs are robust and secure.A cool feature of this set -- it includes a wire cutter that works very well if you line it up properly. The cutter is part of my tool kit now in case I need to repair or make a cable. A screwdriver is also included -- everything you need to patch your board is in the set.To assemble a cable, you just back the plug's locking screw out, and insert the straight-cut cable with a twisting motion. You'll feel it lock in place. You then tighten the screw down and the connection is made, and it is secure.There are enough plugs in the kit for five patch cables. And a generous amount of cable. Even after wiring my 26"" x 12"" pedal board, I had 4 feet of cable left over -- plenty left to make more.The sound quality is fantastic -- comparable to George Ls. I twisted them around to listen for shorts or noise, and everything stayed clean. And since they're a little easier to assemble than George Ls, and a bit beefier, I might just stick with these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27291GS8V4UG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BW2D84#wasThisHelpful","R27291GS8V4UG6","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very well made case. Nice, even stitching around the leatherette pocket, fits the S6 like a second skin. It's a slightly slimmer profile than an Otterbox case I also own for my S6. It's not quite as much protection as the Otterbox, but still feels very secure.The credit card pouch is a little tight with three cards in it, but I'm thinking it will loosen up a bit over time. In theory, according to the manufacturer, the pouch will also hold cash in addition to three cards, but only a tightly folded single bill. In theory. If you do it, you're going to be squeezing a booger out of Alexander Hamilton's nose.It is ingenious design to utilize a card in the case slot as a stand. This helps keep the profile very slim.Despite the slim profile, the bezel around the camera is deep enough to protect the lens. The case bezel around the screen on the front is deep enough to keep the screen recessed for protection. The ports don't have a cover like an Otterbox, but it does make them easier to access.It's great to have a lightweight efficient case so I don't have to carry a wallet full of cards for short trips out.For slimness and convenience, I'm gonna give it five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JT782X613VVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNOB7WS#wasThisHelpful","R2JT782X613VVY","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm impressed. My son bought the twin sized one from Amazon and I had the pleasure of assembling it. And it really was a bit of fun putting it together because its well designed and went together easily. I had it assembled in about 15 minutes.Here are a few points that impressed me:-- Everything is included, including the hex key (Allen wrench) to tighten the bolts. No need to dig out any tools.-- The side frames simply unfold and are locked in place by a brace and pre-installed wingnut. Almost as easy as a camping cot.-- There's no ""wrong"" way to put in the three rectangular cross members. The holes are equally spaced and they are completely reversible and invertible.-- All the metal ""slats"" just press into place with a little body weight.-- All the metal-to-metal contact points are cushioned with plastic caps -- no squeaking or scraping.-- The head and foot slats are pre-drilled with holes so you can attach a headboard and foot board if you choose. (Maybe one of your own making. Fun!)-- The legs are capped to prevent floor scratches.-- It's surprisingly light. The twin size in the box was only a little over 25 pounds.-- In spite of that light weight, when assembled, it's VERY sturdy and rigid.-- It can be unassembled just as easily, making it a great stowaway bed frame. If completely unassembled, it takes up little space. The box it comes in measures about 15 by 40 inches and only 2 and a half inches thick. Easily stood in a closet (along with many more, if you choose.)It's fun to work with a product that is well thought out and well made.

"I don't have a nail fungus to try this out on. So I tried it on a spot of scalp fungus, and got good results. I applied it only once a day instead of twice, since the scalp is a lot less tough than a nail.(This is an off-label use of the product, so keep that in mind if you decide to try it.)I've gotten good results using unrefined coconut oil in the past, but straight coconut oil is, well, oily, and stays oily. Coconut oil's lauric acid content is rather dilute, and it works slowly. And of course it smells coconutty. Not complaining, but there may be times you don't want oily coconut-smelling hair. This product isn't as oily and has no fragrance. And, although I didn't count the days until I got results, it seems to work faster.I also like that there isn't a single sulfite or sulfate compound in the list of ingredients.If you try this for a similar use, instead of using the bottle's dropper, dabbing it on with a Q-Tip will help put it where you want it and keep it from running and dripping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23VZWKYJH1TI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP8SRV8#wasThisHelpful","R23VZWKYJH1TI3","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a ""model 77"" worm-drive fan, but I have a feeling I'll be reaching for this sidewinder a LOT.This Skilsaw is a ""righty,"" meaning the blade is on the right of the motor and is positioned toward the right side of the plate foot. So most of the plate's width is to the left of the blade, supporting most of the saw's weight.For a right-handed carpenter, there are advantages to having the foot plate and the weight of the saw to the left of the blade. The saw is supported on the stock material instead of the ""drop"" material (the piece that will fall as you make the cut).With the lefty saws, only about an inch of the plate is on the stock material. As you near the end of the cut and the drop starts falling away, you're forced to keep the saw square with your wrist -- sometimes a 14-pound saw -- and that can result in inaccuracy in squareness. But your cut is true to the line because you can see the line easily for the whole length. (Credit where credit is due: Experienced, skilled carpenters can hold a very accurate square cut with a lefty worm drive saw.)Because of the stable support on the stock material for the whole length of the cut, you easily get dead square cuts with a righty saw when cutting studs and such.A disadvantage of a ""righty"" is the cutting line is difficult to see -- you have to look over the motor and through an opening in the foot plate. When cutting panel or sheet goods, the farther out you reach as you cut, the less you can see.This Skilsaw allows for that with a very large opening in the foot to view the blade. However it still goes out of view as you reach forward with a long cut on sheet goods. For those situations, some sort of saw guide is practically a must.Speaking of the plate foot, this saw has the largest foot of all the circular saws I own -- it's roughly 6.5"" X 11.5"". It's practically an inverted table. LOTS of support for stability in cutting. And it's cast magnesium, like the worm drive 1677M, instead of stamped metal. Which is great -- no warping or bending. I have a feeling a stamped metal foot that large would be bent within a week of use.Because all that surface supports a combination square or speed square very nicely, it's easy to adjust the blade into squareness. Skil does not include a hex key (Allen wrench) for this. I used a 2.5mm size. It only took a quarter turn of the adjustment screw to bring it square.After getting that square, I set the foot angle to the 45-degree stop and checked it, found it about a half degree shy -- close enough for most uses. The stop is a spring tab that can be pushed out of the way to increase the foot angle to over 50 degrees. It's not recommended due to increased chances of blade binding, but that extra angle is there for the rare occasion you might need it.Max cutting depth is 2.5 inches, but at that setting the motor housing will not clear the flange of a speed square. So if you're using a speed square for true cuts, max depth is going to be just a bit over two inches.It's VERY well built. I haven't done a tear down (and don't plan to), but it looks and feels about as well built as my Bosch 1677M. Skil is wholly owned by Bosch (and that's why it's cool that Bosch makes ""model 77"" worm drive saws -- since they own the company that invented it). And though Skil has become thought of as more of the consumer line to Bosch's pro line (as Black and Decker is the consumer line to the DeWalt pro line), this saw has the quality and feel of a Bosch-branded saw, or a top-shelf Skilsaw from back in the day.I'm not quite sure what they mean by ""worm drive technology"" in what is obviously a direct-drive sidewinder, there being no gearbox or oil reservoir. It appears that it's a reference to the power and design of the drive motor. The manual warns about startup torque, but it's nothing like the twisting torque of a worm drive. It's just a brief little lift of the back end. It's downright stable.It doesn't seem to be as muscular as the worm drive 1677M, but it's still powerful. Knots and sapwood aren't going to challenge it at all.For its size and power, it's light. That's excellent. Here's a weight and feature comparison of the circular saws I own, mainly to show how this Skilsaw compares in weight:-- Bosch 1677M. Cast magnesium plate foot, narrow. Worm drive lefty. 14 pounds.-- Skilsaw 534 consumer light duty sidewinder righty. Vintage saw, 6.5"" blade, reminds me of a retro diner milkshake mixer. Stamped metal plate foot. 9 pounds.-- DeWalt DW939 18V cordless, sidewinder lefty, 6.5"" blade. Not much power. Very occasional use. 8.25 pounds with battery.This Skilsaw, with by far the widest plate foot, cast magnesium, sidewinder righty, 10.25 pounds.Despite it being a powerful and solidly built saw, it's closer in weight to the light saws than the heavyweight 1677M worm drive.The on-board blade-changing wrench storage is a nifty feature.And it comes with a couple of nifty Skilsaw brand logo stickers.At this price point this thing is a winner all the way. And if one were to choose to head to a site with only one saw, or to have only one saw in the shed, this could well be the one to choose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XYF68ZYIUVRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKGAURI#wasThisHelpful","R2XYF68ZYIUVRH","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice curtains, great price. They're definitely blackout curtains The fabric is nice but just a bit limp -- the ungrommeted version with fabric back loops sags a little bit between the loops instead of standing up like the photo shows. But that's a minor quibble. They still look very nice.I found them a bit of a challenge to alter. I shortened them from 63 inches (they actually measured 62 inches) to 48 inches. I found that the reason they are such effective blackout curtains is there is a layer of black fabric sandwiched within them. Those layers make it difficult to iron a crease for a hem -- it kept springing back. The curtains are labeled 100 percent polyester, but I found I had to set my iron on the wool setting to get the fabric to behave. (If you try this, make sure you stay alert for scorching or melting.) The fabric is very stretchy too, so I found that a few puckers were unavoidable when sewing the new hem. Fortunately they're all on the window side and don't show.All that said, it's a great price for nice looking thermal blackout curtains.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R154CY70ZQZSG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQWGY4I#wasThisHelpful","R154CY70ZQZSG7","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me point out that the ""Indian Summer check"" pattern is an autumn palette of colors, not a summer palette. It seems obvious in retrospect, given that Indian Summer is an autumn event, not a summer one. But for some reason I saw the word ""summer"" and expected summer colors.That said, the colors of the Indian Summer palette check napkins are beautiful -- rich and vivid autumn hues. The material is a nice weight -- not too thin. And there are other uses for these. I know because a crafting person I know got a look at them and confiscated them to make purses with. She plans to give them a good spray of fabric protectant and craft away.At 20 inches square (or 18 after washing) they're a good bandana size too. And might even look better for that purpose after a few washes.Since they are cotton and so richly dyed, if I were to wash them (I'm not going to have a chance to, since they're going to craft use), I would put a cup of vinegar in the wash to help lock the colors in, and of course touch them up with an iron after drying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AHUAV0HEP88T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SE9S38#wasThisHelpful","R2AHUAV0HEP88T","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stuff is really sticky and gooey, but it dries glossy and white. The trick in applying it is to run a very small bead. Then you ""tool"" it with a finger. If you run too thick a bead, it accumulates as you run your finger along, and you're bulldozing a big lump of it and it spreads too wide, and cleaning that up is a chore. (I use rubbing alcohol to do that.)Speaking of chore, removing old caulk is where the real work is. I use WD-40 and Dawn detergent together and let it soak few hours to soften it up a bit. Sometimes it works, sometimes not so much. Whether it softens a lot or not, I then remove it with an old wood chisel and paint scraper (one that uses single edge razor blades.) I take care to cut and slice the caulk out, not gouge the tile or tub. I follow with a good cleaning with detergent to remove the oil and old soap accumulation before re-caulking.Fresh, bright, glossy, non-mildewing caulk like this will really brighten an older bath.

"First thing I noticed on unboxing this projector is it's SMALL. Very portable. It's about the size of a slice of bread and an inch thick. It fits in a jacket or jeans pocket. Our kitchen scale says it weighs just over 10 ounces.My first concern was that 100 lumens is bright for a flashlight, but not so much for a projector. A home theater projector requires 1200 or more lumens for a nice bright picture. I looked forward to trying it out.It has wifi, and has a built-in Android operating system (v 2.3.1, according to the manufacturer website.) It has a touchpad on top, along with a focus wheel. No optical zoom wheel or adjustment.(Just to clear up any potential confusion, let me point out that this is a full color projector. The listing title says ""black/white,"" but that's just the color of the projector itself.)There's an SD/MMC card slot in back, along with mini-USB and mini-HDMI ports for connecting to a computer, and a headphone/audio out jack. There are laptop-size speakers built into the sides. On one side is an 1/8"" A/V in (in case you want to hook a game console, video camera or separate media player to it), the other has a standard USB port for dongles or thumb drives (so you can play videos or other media from them or cards in the SD/MMC slot. In other words, you don't have to carry a tablet or computer to play media, just an SD card or USB drive with your movies on it.In addition to media, it also has viewing support for .pdf, .ppt/pptx, .xls/xlsx, and .doc/docx formats.What's in the box:The projector (of course.)An HDMI-to-mini-HDMI cable. The big end goes to your computer's HDMI port, the little end goes to the projector. If you have an HDMI port, this will give the best resolution.A USB-to-mini-USB cable. Same deal -- big end to computer, little end to the projector. Use this to move files to the projector and upgrade software.Quick start guide and manual (in several language versions). These docs are TINY, with TINY text, difficult to read as a result, and I could find no downloadable PDF versions online. Not even on the XSories web site. (I assume that brand name is pronounced ""X-S-ories."")AC adapter/charger (12v, 2A) with three different snap-in, easily interchangeable plugs for US, UK, and EUR use.A soft case. The AC adapter was packed in it, but it's obviously for the projector.What's NOT in the box (but available for purchase separately as accessories):A 5-way splitter component cable for connecting to component systems.A 3-way A/V splitter cable for connecting to game consoles, video cameras or other media players.An antenna for digital TV.An iPhone/iPad connector cable.A sound station for audio boosting.An MHL to HDMI cable.A VGA cable.I plugged it in for a charge. I noticed the LED adapter/charge indicator is not very bright. That's GOOD. Shows some thought went into this device. You don't want a too-bright LED competing with your projected image.After charging the recommended 3 hours, the LED switched from red to green, and I was ready to try it out.If you want something this portable and convenient, chances are you're not going to be lugging a screen around. That's okay, because there are plenty of things that can be used as makeshift screens, such as walls or poster board or sheets or foam core or large sheets of paper or the side of a tent (or the ceiling, which is awesome for watching while kicked back in a recliner or sofa or such). Or for a better image quality you could buy some projector screen material and just roll it up and take it along and tack or tape it up when needed. A dry-erase whiteboard makes an excellent screen for this projector. That's what I used for most of my testing, along with a wall and a ceiling.After booting (which takes about 30 seconds) and focusing the projected image, I navigated to the Android OS and activated wifi. In about a minute I was online.The Android OS is limited. And appears dated. I tried to browse YouTube and got repeated security certificate warnings, so I disabled the warnings in the Android settings panel. Scrolling is done by sliding a finger along the side and bottom of the touchpad. There are no buttons -- you tap the touchpad to click. There are spots on the top for ""home,"" ""back,"" and, I assume, ""settings."" It's not really easy to navigate.I went back to YouTube and successfully played a video, but navigating around YouTube was frustrating. The browser wasn't smooth, and the scrolling and such was kind of clunky. I'm not sure online viewing with the built in OS is a strong point with this projector.Speaking of which, if there's an easy way to install an Amazon or Netflix app (which don't come pre-installed) on this device, I couldn't find it. I suspect it takes one of those complicated procedures like with a rooted device -- using the USB cable and connecting to a computer and flashing ROMs and and such.I tested playing .mp4 vids and viewing .jpg photos from an SD card, and it readily found and played both. Photos are launched in a slideshow by default, and transitions and view times and such are adjustable in settings. Likewise, it easily found and played .mp4s from a USB stick.Adjusting things like contrast, brightness, color, volume, and such is a bit of an annoying process. Some are done from the native menu. Other adjustments and setup (such as for wifi) are done within the Android settings menu. And it's not really easy to get things done with the touchpad. There are some pop-up adjustment sliders that will appear if you slide a finger along the right edge of the pad while playing media, but they're still a bit difficult to get used to adjusting.It gets really warm while operating, and there is some fan noise, but it's relatively quiet. Battery life seems to be as advertised, about 2 hours on a charge, but leaving Wifi on will probably shorten that. If a movie runs over 90 minutes, you're probably better off using the adapter.The built-in sound is about what you'd expect from a couple of tiny laptop speakers. You'll want to use headphones or run the audio through a system if you want better quality.There's no optical zoom. The picture size can only be adjusted by moving the projector. Brightness diminishes considerably with distance and picture size. I'd say 12 to 14 feet is about its max effective distance, and at that distance the image is a little larger than 6 feet across. In total darkness you may be able to go a little larger with it.There is no keystone adjustment either. If you want to avoid the trapezoid, the projector will have to be positioned square to the screen.The projection lens isn't very wide angle. The distance-to-picture-size (or MTS or meter-to-screen) ratio is kind of small. When the projector is at optimum distance for brightness -- about four or five feet from the screen -- the picture doesn't look much bigger than a regular laptop monitor. Which sort of defeats the purpose of having a projector in the first place. You could just turn your laptop around and show it to the group.And to go much larger, you're going to need a very dark room and some distance. It's not going to be useful for the typical boardroom or conference room.About picture quality: I tried it as a display/monitor with two different laptops using the HDMI cable, and spent some time tweaking settings to get the most I could get out of it, and got similar results. It's not HD. It's a tad globby, whether operating on wifi, HDMI, or watching a movie from an SD card or USB drive. Considering the size of the projector I guess it's a bit much to expect genuine hi-res 1080p.So those are the two negative things -- picture size and picture quality. Kind of important for a projector. But it's a trade off for the super portability.To summarize, this isn't a productivity or business item. It's a fun item. It will do for movies and images, but used as a computer display/monitor, screen fonts are not clear and crisp, and it is sure to be tiring if one is using it for number crunching or word processing for any length of time. It may be useful for the occasional location presentation to a very small group in a very dark room. But I'd say this one's for movies and pictures or gaming that isn't HD dependent. Even then, don't expect wall-sized projection and super brightness. I'm guessing it will be about half the size and brightness you might expect.I'm giving it four stars because of the coolness and wow factor -- the smallness and portability -- but with reservations. Since battery life is only two hours, you're going to probably be carrying the adapter with it. And at this price point, I'm not sure what the advantages are except for the exceptionally small size. For less money you can get a 1200-lumen HD projector with many features this projector lacks. So whether this projector appeals to you is going to depend on your intended use and situation. Who knows -- maybe you're looking for a little projector to connect to your computer to watch Amazon Prime or Netflix on the ceiling, or one you can toss in a bag or backpack with some SD cards and take with you on trips. If so, it may be just what you're looking for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P4UR9GYP1CYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJALISY#wasThisHelpful","R1P4UR9GYP1CYO","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bulbs in the photo in the listing are a little different from what's in the package. The bulb has a standard base for common light and lamp sockets, but the bulb part is smaller than what appears in the photo -- it's not much bigger than a golf ball. But it still puts out a lot of light. And even though it has a skirt like most LED bulbs, it sits so low in a lamp base that it casts light around about as well as an incandescent or CFL bulb. Meaning no ""skirt shadow"" on the lamp shade or globe.The light color is just a bit to the warm side of white. Not too yellowish, and not a trace of annoying blue tint. They're pretty close to incandescent light in color.The brightness is a bit surprising. Though they're supposed to be equivalent to a 25-watt incandescent bulb, they look closer to a 40-watt bulb in brightness to me. And all that while drawing less than 5 watts of electricity. And they're rated for over 30,000 hours of use. In spite of the up front cost of over $6.00 USD per bulb (which is a lot lower than LED bulbs used to cost), they will save money in the long run.Do note in the listing that these are not dimmable bulbs. They probably wouldn't play well in a circuit with a wireless remote switch either. I had an LED bulb go out in such a circuit once. These are best used in lamps or circuits with simple straightforward on-off switches.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y0S9MM9GWVIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVLRDVA#wasThisHelpful","R1Y0S9MM9GWVIN","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered three of these -- two of the 18-inch  and one of the 12-inch sizes. All three were slightly twisted. The mounting plates weren't square and aligned evenly and parallel with each other.The problem with the mounting plates not being even and square is the temptation to screw them down hard until they sit flat on the wall. That introduces a lot of spring tension that can result in the screws popping out, or not being able to get them driven in in the first place.This appears to have been a manufacturing flaw, not something that occurred in transit. I say that because the square bars appear to be tempered -- straightening them required a lot of force. I clamped them to a heavy sawhorse and, wearing work gloves, muscled them back to as straight an alignment as I could. I didn't get them completely straight, but I did manage to get them a lot straighter than they arrived.Speaking of screws, the ones included are a little short for a sturdy installation, in my opinion. And wall anchors are not included. The screws heads do show after installing.I'm still giving them three stars -- the ""it's okay"" rating -- because they look okay, and would work in contemporary or retro decor. And they're quite a bargain compared to buying actual vintage retro chrome towel bars. Just be prepared to have to straighten them before installing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MERMZXAVLDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00448FY5U#wasThisHelpful","R2MERMZXAVLDI","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sharpening tools is an arcane art I never thought I could master. Thanks to instructional videos like those by Paul Sellers (do a search for ""sharpen a chisel"" and you'll find one) I found I could not only do it myself, I could attain the legendary ""scary sharp"" edge. I mean actually scary sharp. I've gotten near mirror-finish edges so sharp that just checking an edge for sharpness with a light touch with my thumb resulted in small shallow cuts. And that without a final leather buffing.It's a great skill to have. Sharp tools are a pleasure to work with. And if you accidentally drop a tool or dull a blade somehow or over time with regular use, you can bring it back to sharpness yourself.And plate glass with wet-dry sandpaper is the most cost-efficient and simple way to get it done. No need to spend upwards of a hundred dollars or more on exotic stones or diamond-imbedded plates. Just glue some wet-dry sandpaper to a dead-flat piece of glass and you're in business.I had success my first try. I borrowed a plate glass top from a patio furniture table and used some spray glue to fasten the sandpaper to it. As I recall, I used pieces of 400/800/1500/2000 grit. I used soapy water in a spray bottle to wet the paper (just a few drops of dish soap per bottle of water). Then I used the techniques I learned from the Sellers video. Even without the benefit of a bevel edge guide, within an hour, several cheap chisels from my tool box had hundred-dollar edges and performance.Unfortunately the glass had to be returned to the patio table. And the spray glue wasn't holding reliably and was a bit of a bother. And I felt I could get more repeatable results with a bevel edge guide. So I ordered this kit, along with a set of coarse replacement paper to go with the fine grades of paper that come with the kit.Since the paper is self-adhesive, no spray glue is required. And with the included grippy mat to hold the plate glass in place instead of rubber feet, sandpaper can be applied to both sides of the glass to maximize usefulness.The glass in the kit is tempered and has a nice smooth finished edge. The bevel guide has a smooth rolling wheel (important for not tearing the paper or wearing the wheel) and reference settings molded into the side so you'll always have the reference handy to check how far out to extend the chisel blade to get the degree bevel you want. (Those settings are in millimeters, by the way, so you'll need a small metric rule for accurate setup.) The bevel guide also accepts hand plane blades.This system is, to me, the way to go. This is an inexpensive and effective way to turn budget tools into top-drawer performers. And of course once you get those super sharp edges, handle and store your tools safely and out of the reach of children!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30667XH451NKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADAAC1E#wasThisHelpful","R30667XH451NKS","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works great! You'll need to provide your own fan (a 20-inch box fan is recommended) and plug-in timer. A surge protector strip is handy too. That way you can plug the ozone generator and fan into the surge strip and the strip into the timer, and the timer into the wall outlet.I didn't use a 20-inch box fan. I used a 12-inch one set on high and got great results. The situation was a reno of an old 12 X 16-foot room that hadn't had much air circulation for a few years. So there was a distinct musty odor even after cleaning and painting.I picked a day with low relative humidity (recommended for better results), set everything up, set the timer, and closed off the room and stuffed towels in the crack under the door. Even with that, the unit made so much ozone I could still smell whiffs of it in the hall. I ran it for two hours, let the room stay closed for another two, then went in and opened the windows and aired the room out for a couple of hours.What a difference!

"Let's face it: this thing is pricey. Is it worth the money? Until I tried it out, I wouldn't have thought so. But now I do, not only because it's well made, but because it has several advantages:It heats a lot quicker than a large stove top pot. It's more energy efficient than stove top canning. The more home canning you do, the more of an advantage that can be.It doubles as a large blancher. If you dehydrate vegetables too, this comes in very handy. One reason we stopped dehydrating food was it took so long for the large stove top pot we were using to start boiling again after we added vegetables. They wound up cooked instead of blanched. With this, we'll probably be dehydrating our own veggies again.Everything, including the base, stores right in the pot. It's a big pot, but that makes it more compact and easy to store.Because it heats so quickly, I don't think it makes a great general purpose cooker. Even the manual advises food with thick sauces or not enough liquid can scorch. We have a pressure cooker and a slow cooker that we'll continue to use for stews and roasts.You'll need a pair of jar lifters (tongs) and a ladle, and of course jars and lids. Everything else is included.Tips: Always preheat jars when canning.

"How nice to have a grain-free wet cat food! We leave dry food out for our cat, and that provides more than enough grain (although grains are not part of a cat's natural diet). Twice a day we've been giving her canned tuna, which avoids adding more grain to her diet and helps her get more hydration (important for cats). We just buy the off-brand tuna on sale, and it's often cheaper than name-brand canned cat food. Incidentally we also have a cat water fountain for her, which we found works wonders in getting cats to drink more water.It's great that a grain-free complete nutrition wet food product is available like this.

"It works. Here in the deep South, insects show up as soon as the rose leaves and buds do. Aphids, Japanese beetles, and several other insect beasties that just love to feast on roses. This knocks them right out.And the roses still smell like roses. No chemical smell lingers after application.This insect killer has a dual action of being both topical and systemic, so it lasts a while. That's a good thing. Insects don't show right back up and motivate you to reapply -- and overapply -- the product.On the negative side, the spray bottle itself isn't the greatest. It leaks a little around the trigger. Definitely wear gloves when you spray. And although the instructions recommend turning the spray bottle nozzle to adjust it to a fine mist, there's no such thing. At least not with the bottle we tried. The best we got out of it was a rather coarse spray.All that aside, we plan to stick to the ""no more than five applications a year"" guidelines, even if at times it means insects on the roses.

"Love this table. One of the secrets to always having a place to tackle a project -- at least for me -- is a folding table. Any ""permanent"" tables tend to attract clutter. And that means that before you can begin a project, your first project has to be clean off the table. But if you put a folding table away between projects (which is another big tip), it doesn't collect clutter and it's always ready to go when you are.This table has three height positions, which is very convenient. You can adjust it to whatever chair you happen to be working from. Or high enough to work from a standing position if you prefer. And it's big and wide enough to spread the work out on.It takes a little practice to get good at opening and folding it. It can pinch fingers. And it's a little awkward, having to turn it over and to from end to end to unlock the legs. And unsnapping the clip when first opening it takes quite a bit of pull. I went through the process several times to get good and familiar with it so I could set it up and take it down smoothly.It's not rock steady, but stable enough for most things.

"I ran a side-by-side test with the AmazonBasics laminator, which at this writing is about 10 dollars less.And there is no comparison. The Fellowes M5-95 performed much better.I tested using 5mil pouches and pieces of cardstock. The AmazonBasics laminator just doesn't seem to get hot enough or apply enough pressure with the rollers to get a clear and clean result. It left a 1/8-inch unlaminated gap all around the edge of the cardstock, and there were streaks where it appears there just wasn't enough heat to make a good clear seal. Even making two passes through the machine didn't result in much improvement.The Fellowes laminator made a good clear seal on the first pass through, and the gap around the cardstock was much smaller -- only about a 16th of an inch, and it was even all the way around, indicating even pressure by the rollers. I don't think any budget-priced home laminator can completely eliminate that gap. But these results are very good.A couple of tips when using either laminator: Put a book or something on the outfeed side of the laminator, level with the bottom of the slot, to give level support to the hot pouch as it exits the machine. This will minimize warping.Secondly, don't trust the green light. Give the machine a couple of extra minutes to heat up.And finally, leave a little border when trimming laminated pieces. If you trim right to the edge of the laminated piece, it will eventually delaminate at the edges. If you like that look, make extra copies so that you can replace them from time to time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CCG1RERMA4ME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RM7WTFS#wasThisHelpful","R1CCG1RERMA4ME","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(It measures about 13 inches wide and a little over 16 inches tall, which isn't too far from being square.)Let's get the negative stuff out of the way first:It's not a silent operator. It makes a bit of noise. Other reviewers noted fan noise and a clicking sound when it cycles.It's wall mount only. The bottom is slanted and it will not operate as a free-standing or portable unit. You'll have to decide where it will stay.It's 1000 watts. That's not going to warm a huge room. I think installing it in a room larger than 12-by-12 feet is going to be a waste of energy, unless you want it to warm up just one zone of the room.The cord is three feet long. So you'll need to hang it near an outlet. (As with any heater, extension cords aren't a good idea.)The operating manual has some of the tiniest print I've seen in a manual.On the positive side:It has a sleek contemporary design.If floor space is more valuable to you than wall space, then wall-mount-only is a desirable feature.The remote control is very handy, if a bit limited in range.The cord will store inside the heater in the warmer season.

The sharp metal edges on the cord storage opening may do some damage to the cord over time, so that's something to watch.It comes with mounting screws (and lugs for drywall) and a little level to make sure it's plumb on the wall.Even though it is wall mounted, for safety, if you plan to mount this heater in potentially wet areas (bathroom, kitchen, etc.), make sure you have a GFI (ground fault interrupter) outlet to plug it into.I'm deducting one star for it's lack of versatility (a flat bottom with an option to remove it from the wall and use it as a freestanding heater would have been awesome), but overall it's a good little unit. And if you're looking for a sleek-looking wall-mounted heater for a small room, this may be just the heater for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25W34QRJ3GHTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KY70YQ#wasThisHelpful","R25W34QRJ3GHTI","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The design of this jacket with its removable layers makes it ideal for southern US winters. In the deep south, one day it's mild, the next three it's very cold, the next rainy and mild again, and so on. You can just pick the layer(s) to wear, or all of them, depending on the day's weather. On mild days you can just wear the outer shell as a windbreaker. The inner liner can be worn as a fairly warm jacket on cooler days. On cold days, you can wear both liner and shell.Even with all layers, it's warm without being bulky, and you can move well in this jacket. The hood is roomy enough to accommodate a cap or even a bike helmet underneath.The jacket is very well made, with big, useful pockets. The fit is just a smidgen to the small side, but not enough to recommend switching to a full size larger than you might normally wear, unless your size is already sort of on the border between two sizes.Like other reviewers, I'm not too fond of the logos, but it's a great jacket nonetheless.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RBOPKV3LWF57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IABVXAC#wasThisHelpful","R2RBOPKV3LWF57","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On a scale of good/better/best I would rate these pliers on the very high side of ""better."" They're not boutique tool grade, but they are high quality.And it's a very useful assortment of pliers, with cutters and a large needle nose pliers included. The push-button adjustment of the channel lock pliers is a lot more convenient than the old ""open 'em wide"" style of adjustment. The smaller of the channel lock pliers has hex-shaped jaws, making it handy for tightening or loosening bolts.Of all the pliers in the set, I personally find lineman's pliers the most versatile and useful for general tinkering. The squared jaws are perfect for bending light gauge metal, they grab well, and the built-in cutters are very handy. If I carried only one pliers in a tool bag, as long as I had an adjustable wrench in there, lineman's pliers would be the one.The handles are comfortable and solidly bonded to the pliers.The tool wrap is a nice bonus. It's well made too.Great set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKC0SKQZ1TKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006GFQOSA#wasThisHelpful","RCKC0SKQZ1TKK","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are much better than standard spade bits.  The self-feeding screw tip makes for a lot less effort in drilling, except for that final bit of drilling when you do have to give a bit of a push. The drilled holes are a lot cleaner with less blowout and splintering on the exit side. Not perfect, but better than regular spade bits. And they drill holes at a fast pace. That pace, incidentally isn't adjustable. The screw is going to pull the bit into the wood at the same pace every time.I agree with other reviewers that these bits are going to deplete cordless drill batteries in a hurry, so unless you have only a few holes to drill, they're best used with a corded drill. I also agree that they seem to work better when chucked to the rounded part of the shank instead of the hex end.Overall very good quality bits and a good addition to the tool box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G35YK3TMY4PP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LQ905E#wasThisHelpful","R1G35YK3TMY4PP","A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used lower bandwidth powerline adapters, so upgrading to the new TRENDnet Power Line 1200 AV2s was a revelation.

I'm generally quite happy with this product, but I did struggle a little to get a handshake between the two adapters.

"I've owned a few ""sports"" armbands for various devices over the years, and they're an essential accessory if you want to take your MP3 player or phone to the gym, on a hike, or when you walk your dog. It seems the quality of these armbands varies wildly among manufacturers--some seem to last forever, while others fall apart like a cardboard suit after a few uses. I am happy to report that Bluebits' new sports armband is extremely durable and it looks like it could withstand a lot of abuse, sweat, rain, and whatnot. It's easy to use--no complicated latches or hooks, and the plastic covering your phone is thin enough to make using it easy (some of these armbands use plastic so thick and/or inflexible that no amount of pressing seems to cause your phone to respond). The best part of this armband, in my opinion, is the price. $15.99 gets you a product that I think is actually better than the Belkin I paid $30+ for. In terms of negatives, the only thing I can think of is that I would have liked the ""belt"" to have been a little longer. I have large biceps and it can be a bit of a challenge to attach this armband. An extra inch or two would make a huge difference.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R153ONV3M7MN8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016IZ9I8U#wasThisHelpful","R153ONV3M7MN8D","A1YVO5V1SO18DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YVO5V1SO18DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Even though I am primarily an Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom user, there are many times when I actually prefer the simplicity and automation of Photoshop Elements, which is a graphics editor that has 90% of Photoshop's capabilities for 20% of the price. It's been a few years since I upgraded my copy of Photoshop Elements, and the newest version (#14) seemed to have enough new and interesting features to make me want to make the jump--and I'm really glad I did.Over the years, the full Photoshop program's interface has become almost comically dense, making it hard to find less-frequently used tools and features. Elements, on the other hand, seems to be getting simpler in newer generations. I like the streamlined ""desktop"" and the way the tools and controls are laid out and organized. Things seem more logical now, and for less experienced image editors, the intimidation factor has probably dropped a few notches as a result.I won't list all the feature changes between my old version of Elements (#11) and the new one, but if you're upgrading from a 3- to 4-year old rev of the program like I am, you'll definitely feel like you're getting your money's worth in terms of added capabilities, a richer set of tools, filters, and templates, and a really slick approach to automating repetitive tasks like batch converting images from one format to another.Adobe has always struggled with the ""kitchen sink"" approach to software development, and they seem to be doing a lot to streamline and simplify, particularly in the consumer-focused products like Photoshop and Premiere Elements. They're both terrifically capable tools for editing pictures and videos (and packaging the end result for family and friends), and you simply can't argue with the price. Yes, there are a lot of free apps and programs out there that claim to do what Photoshop Elements does, but I haven't seen anything that matches the seamless integration of so many functions and options into a really slick, user friendly package like this. Highly recommended for novices and experts alike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PECAS20TZ1EC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GP8XGM#wasThisHelpful","R1PECAS20TZ1EC","A1YVO5V1SO18DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YVO5V1SO18DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vornado fans and heaters move a lot of air, which is a critical success factor if you're trying to cool or heat a larger room. But that's true of a lot of products like this one--most of which sell for a lot less money. What differentiates a Vornado heater from the off-brand (i.e., ""el cheapo"") products that you can find at Target or WalMart is quality, plain and simple. The thing is built to last--the case feels sturdy, the controls and switches move smoothly and give you positive tactile feedback so you know moving a dial is actually doing something, and even little things that you seldom notice (from the heavy gauge power cord to a well-written and designed owner's manual) are top shelf and a real confidence booster. Trust me, you don't want to be thinking about where the manufacturer decided to cut corners when you flip the power switch on a space heater in your kid's bedroom. So again, this is a product that exemplifies the motto, ""you get what you pay for."" It's a powerful, quiet heater that works efficiently and operates effortlessly. The only quibble I have with this model is that there are only two power settings--750 watt and 1500 watt--and that can make it a challenge to reach your desired temp and keep it there. Otherwise, this is a fine product and well worth the investment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OLF2D408WSKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVIPVHU#wasThisHelpful","R2OLF2D408WSKQ","A1YVO5V1SO18DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YVO5V1SO18DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These LED off-road floodlights are a massive upgrade from traditional incandescent lights. They're diamond bright and throw out a ton of light.

"I prefer to wear my activity tracker wristband 24/7, but I've gone through two similar products because they apparently had no tolerance for moisture and the bands themselves couldn't handle continuous use. A friend of mine who works at REI (and does a lot of extreme outdoor activities in brutal conditions) recommended the Jawbone UP2 which is designed to withstand a little more abuse than most wristbands. It's also better able to flex thanks to a clever loop design that loosens up if you snag the band on something. In terms of the tracker hardware and software, I greatly prefer the display style and website/app software to the relatively crude user interface of the Fitbit devices. Of course, this is just a matter of personal preference; both systems work pretty much the same and provide the same data. I didn't have any issues with the accuracy of either brand's wristbands. On the whole, I think the Jawbone UP2 will turn out to be a better investment, if for no other reason than that is seems to be holding up better than the wristbands I've used previously.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QGPBZMGDD3OD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HOIFFW#wasThisHelpful","R2QGPBZMGDD3OD","A1YVO5V1SO18DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YVO5V1SO18DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Office for many, many years, and to Microsoft's credit, they have always offered a lot of added value with each of their major product updates (unlike companies like Quicken, Adobe, etc. whose annual product updates add on piles of mostly useless ""features"" that just make their programs increasingly complex and hard to use).I thought Office 2013 was a polished, well-integrated suite of software products and I have been very happy with the significant improvements to the user interfaces and the key functionality of Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. The 2013 release made Office easier to use, and it was worth the cost of the upgrade.The Office 2016 suite gives users an equivalent level of improvement overall. The first thing I noticed is that the programs load much faster, and the interfaces have been further streamlined (in particular, the menus and tools can be more easily configured to individualize the user experience). If you're a long-time Office user, this new version will feel familiar and comfortable--and a lot easier on the eyes.One of the most noteworthy new features is something long overdue--real-time collaboration--which allows multiple users to work on a document at the same time. Alterations to a document or slide show are annotated with the date, time, and name of the person making the change. This is a terrific feature for those of us who depend on content and edits from colleagues in order to bring a document to finished form.

"I am really pleased with the performance of Vornado's new heater, model AVH10. Living in the Upper Midwest, I've probably owned a dozen of space heaters over the years, and most of them were junk. The AVH10 is a cut above the rest. It feels solid, and Vornado didn't cut any corners in terms of the materials used to make this model. The controls are idiot proof and the temperature settings seemed to be pretty accurate. It's also a very quiet heater, which is significant if you plan to use this in a bedroom or office. In terms of power, the AVH10 puts out an amazing amount of heat when you consider how small this thing is. The only drawback I could think of is that the initial ""burn off"" from the heater coils fills the room with a pretty nasty chemical smell. It took 3-4 hours of use for that smell to completely dissipate, but the issue is common to most space heaters.

"The new Logitech BLOK keyboard case is an extremely lightweight add-on for your iPad Air 2.

"ASUS has come up with a ""flip"" design for their Transformer Book product line that feels so much better than the designs used by most competing models. The hinge that allows you to flip the screen display runs across most of the long edge of the device which increases stability and makes everything feel more secure (and in the long run, more durable). The flip hinge might not seem like a big factor when you're deciding which laptop, tablet, or 2-in-1 notebook to buy, but when you use a device like this in one of the various viewing modes (tablet, tent, stand, and laptop), it's reassuring to know that when you set it down on an airplane tray, it's going to stay in place. (I'm speaking from experience after watching somebody's iPad air flop onto the floor and crack when the $200 alligator skin case suddenly collapsed. Ouch!)If you're a power user, the specs of the ASUS Transformer Book Flip TP200SA-DH04T won't excite you. In order to increase portability (and make it possible to use the device in tablet mode), a lot of compromises were made in terms of what you find under the hood. Although the TP200SA-DH04T runs the more efficient Windows 10 operating system, 4gb of RAM will prove a liability for people using memory hogs like photo/video editing software, working with large spreadsheets, or watching high-definition video. But I found that in general use (web surfing, streaming music and video, Microsoft Office applications, etc.), there were no significant speed issues--due in part to the sizable 64gb SSD that serves as a memory cache.Another factor impacting speed is the decision to use the new 802.11AC protocol rather than the slower 802.11N standard for WI-FI. If you have an AC router, you will immediately notice how much faster everything loads when you're online.The other hardware specs are typical for a device in this price range--which is to say you get a lot of capabilities for a machine that sells for under $400.All in all, this is a very capable and flexible computer. It's lightweight, it has the convenience of a dual tablet/notebook configuration, and for the vast majority of users, it will run most programs as well as most of the laptops on the market.

The idea is that you can view, save, and assess your blood glucose levels using an app on your smartphone, and even share the data you collect with others, including caregivers and family members. This is all well and good, but we found the app is, at best, a work in progress. I used the app on a LG G3 phone running Android v5.1 and while it installed successfully, it crashes virtually every time I open it. I tried turning off various background programs, assuming there was some kind of a conflict going on, but it didn't seem to make much difference in terms of the success rate of getting the app to launch and load without crashing. Then I installed the app on an older Moto X phone running Android 4.x and the app seemed to load okay--but then  crashed randomly just about every time I launched it. It's a shame, because without the app, the iHealth BG5 is pretty much useless.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REMX7YSAL3ID9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1IRZTW#wasThisHelpful","REMX7YSAL3ID9","A1YVO5V1SO18DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YVO5V1SO18DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This really a nice, solid product that feels great in your hand and does a superb job of shaving and trimming. At this price point, that shouldn't come as a surprise, but over the years I've been repeatedly disappointed by shavers that have all the bells and whistles, but can't shave my face worth a darn. The newest Panasonic model gives you a surprisingly close shave--without the irritation and ""gotchas"" of cheaper or inferior models. Maybe that has something to do with the design and ergonomics. This particular shaver feels perfect in my hand, with just the right heft to keep it steady and a head design that conforms to all the curves and angles of your face.

"The concept behind the elaborately titled ""Spending the Holidays with People I Want to Punch in the Throat: Yuletide Yahoos, Ho-Ho-Humblebraggers, and Other Seasonal Scourges"" is a good one, although not unique in the annals of holiday literature. Still, who doesn't enjoy a good Christmas-themed yarn about the people in our lives--the well-meaning, the kooks, and the malcontents--who can make or break the season with their overbearing, selfish, clueless, or drunken behavior? I certainly do, and I was eager to dive into Jen Mann's new book. Unfortunately, while Mann has conjured up a lot of good stories, the writing isn't as polished--and the wit isn't as sharp--as I would have hoped. Mann is a decent writer, but these tales lack the sparkle and vividness of similar compilations.

"I've worn a beard for many years, and I have used a number of trimmers over that period--some good, most mediocre. It shouldn't be that difficult to design a cordless trimmer that conforms to one's face, fits the hand well, holds a charge longer than 10 minutes, and stays sharp for more than a few months. In contrast to all the disappointing trimmers I've tried and discarded, the new Panasonic ER-GB60-K trimmer is excellent. It's quiet, has great ergonomics, provides a wide range of trim lengths, and runs for nearly an hour on a charge.

The only negative is the ergonomics of the handle--I like to shave while I'm showering, and this handle is particularly difficult to hold when it's slippery.

"Here's the bottom line in terms of whether or not you'll enjoy playing ""Utter Nonsense"": If you're intending to play this game with your kids or your elderly parents, you might find the experience to be a little uncomfortable. The game has a certain shock value like ""Cards Against Humanity"" that makes it more suitable for playing with a group of adult friends. Having said that, how much you enjoy playing this game with your adult friends will depend on what your definition of ""funny"" is. A lot of the humor is pretty crude, and the basic concept of the game involves having participants use accents to read off scenarios. That can be funny, but at times playing the game reminded me of the scene in ""The Office"" in which Michael Scott repeatedly asks one of his employees if she ""wants a cookie."" What made that scene so uncomfortable to watch--it was not intended to be a ""funny"" scene, by the way--was that Michael Scott was speaking in a ridiculously exaggerated Indian accent and his employee, whose family was from India, is deeply offended and ends up slapping her boss. If you think that kind of thing is a riot, then you'll probably get a kick out of ""Utter Nonsense.""

"I have the misfortune of being a Mediacom customer. If you've never had the pleasure of dealing with this stone-age cable provider, then you're really missing out on something. All of their proprietary hardware--from cable boxes, to DVRs, to modems--looks and operates like technological relics from Soviet-era Eastern Bloc countries. Although I can't choose my cable provider, I can swap out their hardware for stuff that's light years ahead of their crap. I replaced their DVR (which had a user interface that was one step below an Atari game system) with a Tivo, and their modem was recently shipped back and replaced with a shiny new TP-LINK Archer CR700 AC1750 cable modem router. Naturally, Mediacom did everything they could to make the transition as difficult as possible. First, they refused to provision the TP-LINK because it was not on their approved list of modems. I asked to see the list, but they refuse to post it on their website or send it to customers. WTF? I finally reached a tech who admitted they do this to pressure people into using their $8/month relics, but he said he sympathized with my ""situation"" and would provision my TP Link model as a ""one-time exception."" Again, WTF?Once we got past Mediacom's draconian policies and procedures, setting up the TP-LINK CR700 AC1750 cable modem router was a piece of cake. The admin dashboard for the TP-LINK router is excellent. The UI is simple and clean, and everything is logically grouped--which really makes setup go fast. The TP-LINK CR700 offers users a lot of options, including four gigabit ethernet ports for direct connection, and two USB ports for adding printers or external hard drives. I was extremely frustrated to see that the USB ports are 2.0, not the current USB 3.0 standard. That's fine for printers, but if I'm going to attach an external hard drive as a data server, I want the quickest possible throughput. It's inconceivable to me that the manufacturer would elect to cut costs in this manner. However, the ports do work as advertised and that's better than having no ports at all.The wireless performance of the TP-LINK CR700 is exceptionally good--I was able to stream 1080p video without a single hiccup, and internet speeds are virtually as fast using Wi-Fi as they are when I connect directly to the device with an ethernet cable. That's pretty remarkable, and this kind of throughput is what justifies the relatively high cost of these devices.From a user perspective, I found the TP-LINK CR700 to be close to perfect. The only drawback--and it probably won't be an issue for most customers--is the decision to go with USB 2.0 ports in a world in which USB 3.0 is getting to be ubiquitous. I took off one star for this issue. Otherwise, the product is a gem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FCN1ZQVJYK5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012I96J3W#wasThisHelpful","R2FCN1ZQVJYK5C","A1YVO5V1SO18DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YVO5V1SO18DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am an avid reader of non-fiction, but had read Life of Pi among the select fiction that makes its way into my stack of books. I thoroughly enjoyed Life of Pi and was eager to read this new book by the same author. This book sets off on three distinct journeys that are connected. The trio of tales makes for a compelling read, albeit at a pace that can lull at times. I felt the narrative was not as tight as Life of Pi, and maybe that was partially due to Life of Pi being a story where lulls actually added to the telling.  Still, Martel's command of beautifully descriptive and captivating writing propels this book to an excellent read.

It is an odd choice to have word in english and spanish on a  toy that really is designed more for a 9 month to 2 year old rather than a 4 or 5 year old who might actually be starting to learn to read. Basically, the words printed on the cards are completely superfluous other than to remind a nearby adult or older sibling what the english and spanish words for the object shown are so that they may communicate these facts to the baby/toddler.  So, I am completely bewildered by the complaints some reviewers have left, but not to dwell on it, these cards are a fun and engaging toy and work well for siblings of the right ages to play with together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZEG1KVE6758R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ST80H5I#wasThisHelpful","R1ZEG1KVE6758R","A3BKNXX8QFIXIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKNXX8QFIXIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a big step up from the regular Huggies but they are not quite up to Pampers Sensitive Swaddlers.

"While expensive, the Kohler Transitions toilet seat provides a superior potty experience for young children, like mine.Especially in the age range of 2 to 5 years old, it can be difficult for kids to sit on an adult toilet seat on their own.  You can buy a kids toilet seat booster insert for not much money, and we have liked our baby bjorn model, but if you are going to have a lot of shared use between adults and kids, this is a more effortless solution.  The nightlight also comes in very handy since my kids hate having the lights on bright if they wake up at 11pm to go potty.Overall, it is a premium product at a premium price. The value proposition may or may not be there depending on the customer, but it does work well as advertised.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZMMCIQ07BLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZKSRHPS#wasThisHelpful","R2ZMMCIQ07BLZ","A3BKNXX8QFIXIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKNXX8QFIXIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This large playset offers kids tons of play options. It's a house and it's a boat. It has a pool and it comes with a rowboat and an island. They threw in everything and the kitchen sink. We have a similar toy that is a boat and converts to a house-like-thing, but this toy is a bit bigger and has more a few more features. I would have liked a few more characters included with a such a large playset, but we already had a few, so my kids were quite happy with what comes included in the box. Overall, its a sturdy set full of details and is very engaging. My two daughters will get a ton of play time out of it together.

"For any fan of the show, this cookbook is a sure hit. It has a good mix of show-related content and genuinely worthwhile recipes for a wide variety of foods. There is a emphasis on american, latin american, and asian fusion cuisine. As far as I can tell, the recipes are all at least alluded to in the show, if not directly referenced or shown. I can tell so because a side bar on each recipe page gives the relevant dialogue mentioned the food.The production quality on this cookbook is phenomenal. The pictures are gorgeous, there are a ton of little sections about different characters or other things about the show that really make this much more than a cookbook. I don't watch the show that much, so I was more interested in the food. In short, the recipes are great. You could actually separate the recipes and the other content into two books and they would work just fine alone, I think. The recipes are on par with any other cookbook in my collection. The difficulty on them ranges from overly simple to moderately complex and all the ingredients are fairly easy to get ahold of.  There isn't really anything too exotic, but I like that they didn't try to invent their own Modern-Family-Themed foods that really have little to do with the show. This plagues similar cookbooks I have seen for other shows/movies/books. The recipes also manage to balance the demands of being believably part of the show but also consistently worth making. Again, this is often not the case with such cookbooks. Obviously, it is easier to tackle the dishes from Modern Family than those from Harry Potter or Game of Thrones, but it is still an achievement worth praising.Overall, this is one of the most beautifully produced and successfully composed cookbooks related to a show, movie or book that I have ever seen. It stands on its own merit as a cookbook, but would make a terrific gift for any Modern Family fan regardless of how much they like to cook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29VXRMJSXDU5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0848746414#wasThisHelpful","R29VXRMJSXDU5K","A3BKNXX8QFIXIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKNXX8QFIXIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very tasty and tender (relatively) all-beef jerky that comes in a handy 1.5 oz package perfect for a quick snack.  I like the taste better than most other brands, though it reminds me somewhat of a hot dog that has been left out for several hours. If you love chewing endlessly on a leathery piece of jerky, you will be disappointed by how tender this jerky is in comparison and, while it is a bit chewy, you'll find the 1.5 oz stick disappears quickly.Complaints about the salt content are a bit odd as it is jerky. They are all salty. It's a preservative. But yes, it does have about a quarter of a day's worth of salt in one serving, but on the bright side it is 12g of protein and only 90 calories, so if you limit sodium otherwise, it can still be a pretty health addition to your diet.  I also sampled their turkey with bron sugar jerky and was not as happy with that flavor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17MDKDBLG9GMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105DW2WU#wasThisHelpful","R17MDKDBLG9GMW","A3BKNXX8QFIXIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKNXX8QFIXIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some of the Utopian movements detailed in this book are likely familiar names from early American history, as they were quite popular in their time. Yet, they all failed for one reason or another. Perhaps it is easy to say such attempts at a Utopian society are entirely sisyphean, or worse, but it is obvious through the narrative that many, many people believed sincerely in the promise that these movements gave of creating a peaceful, united community free of strife. The author does a terrific job with the flow of the book. Despite these 5 movements being independent of one another, the author is able to successfully connect them to each other and also manages to avoid dwelling too long on any point.  Overall, it is a great read for any pre-civil-war american history buff or those interested in learning about some of these novel movements.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XNO6MW5HDSFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812993705#wasThisHelpful","R2XNO6MW5HDSFL","A3BKNXX8QFIXIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKNXX8QFIXIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Atheism gets a lot of criticism, especially on the supposed basis that it is a fairly recent construct. That is almost obviously not the case, but this book really provides a clear picture of what Atheism was in ancient times and I found the content even more engrossing than I expected. Not unsurprisingly, Atheists often had a tough time of it in the old world. The details of what Atheists faced when in the public eye was interesting, but I did find the author's definition of what an Atheist is to be less purely convinced against the possibility of supernatural forces and somewhat overlapping what I would consider agnosticism. Certainly, even today, the two are often conflated. Yet, to me, agnosticism is quite incompatible with atheism. Regardless, I enjoyed the book and the depth of historical research it provided in discussion of the various atheist figures and movements in ancient times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ND7JBV8A0CRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307958329#wasThisHelpful","R2ND7JBV8A0CRW","A3BKNXX8QFIXIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKNXX8QFIXIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was immediately impressed by the production quality of this large, beautifully illustrated and printed book of puzzles. The whole ""History of Mathematics"" line doesn't really come across as prominently as I expected in the course of the puzzles. Within each chapter you go from one puzzle to the next without any text in between, but there is a narrative and the author does talk about specific historical figures, mathematical concepts and, of course, puzzles.  The puzzles all are rated by challenge and this makes it easy to use the puzzles in a classroom setting or otherwise. Most of the puzzles are not so hard, but there is a lot of variety and even the easier ones are interesting.  This book would be a perfect resources for a math teacher or as a coffee table book. It is far more interesting than pictures of Nantucket, I think. Overall, its a really terrific colllection of interesting puzzles that does manage to tell a story by taking the reader on a chronological journey through mathematical concepts via brainteasers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYDXUZJ8KJEDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770854754#wasThisHelpful","RYDXUZJ8KJEDS","A3BKNXX8QFIXIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKNXX8QFIXIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sage 50 (formerly Peachtree) Accounting software offers a single solution for most small businesses. You can keep track of payroll, inventory, accounts payable/receivable, job costing, financial reports and more. There is an additonal annual fee for  subscription service needed to use all of the payroll features and it will run you extra ($250 currently) after the first year, but this is the norm.Compared to QuickBooks and Quicken, Sage 50 is designed more toward accounts or those with some basic accounting experience and knowledge. It also tries to accomodate legacy users of the older software versions by keeping much of the interface familiar.The cost is not cheap, but it is the cheapest of three versions - Pro/Premium/Quantum.  Most small businesses will probably be fine with Pro, but if you have more than one or two people handling the accounting of your of business, then you should consider Premium and the extra savings potentially afforded by a multi-user license. Also, depending on the nature your of business, you may need the features of Premium over those of Pro.  Quantum is for larger enterprises with much higher volumes of data and is priced accordingly.Overall, Sage 50 is a feature-rich, well-organized, reliable accounting software system that can serve as the backbone for almost any small business given the proper trainng and knowledge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SPHVTK817ATW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011I737YE#wasThisHelpful","R3SPHVTK817ATW","A3BKNXX8QFIXIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKNXX8QFIXIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always loved board games, but video game adaptations are very hit and miss. This one packs in 4 of the most popular board games, all favorites of mine, out of which only one is a dud.Trivial Pursuit, Risk and Monopoly are all given fairly decent production values, but Scrabble did not receive the attention it deserves. Scrabble is an odd choice to include anyhow as it is the only game that really involves private player information (the cards in risk are not as problematic). Having to switch between players in Scrabble as implemented definitely slows the game down versus playing a physical copy, but it is largely unavoidable. A different game would have made more sense to include and maybe that is why the production values are lacking on this entry.Aside from Scrabble, the games work quite well. Trivial Pursuit also doesn't lend itself as readily to the video game format, but the game was reworked into more of a game show format and this was an excellent design choice that really makes Trivial Pursuit stand out as one of the best titles. Risk has a great interface as well and benefits from automation. Monopoly is also implemented well and it is fun. I used to play an old NES version a lot as a kid and this is certainly a step up, but the physical copy works better for larger numbers of players, especially considering trading.Overall, this is a fund title that gives you 2 terrific multiplayer games in Trivial Pursuit and Risk, 1 decent multiplayer/single player experience in Monopoly and 1 solid single player experience in Scrabble. Since the emphasis is on multiplayer, it would have made sense to replace Scrabble, but I am sure it will get some play time for 1 or 2 player games.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CGL5EKLC4IBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0156SN04I#wasThisHelpful","R3CGL5EKLC4IBV","A3BKNXX8QFIXIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BKNXX8QFIXIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This dolled up version of Remington's best-in-class beard trimmer offers some much-needed accessories for those looking to maintain or cultivate a full-figured moustache or beard.

"This compact toaster oven is the perfect size for those without a lot of counter space to spare.  The interior is a little over 9x9 inches. It handles basic toasting and baking just fine, but is hampered by its capacity when baking as it fluctuates in temperature more than a larger toaster oven.

"The kids (5 and 8) absolutely love this toy and were blown away by what it can do.  They have been playing with it every day. The track, which can be configured many ways and expanded with 2-piece packs sold separately, is quite large. The cars take one lap around to learn the track setup and then they are ready to race.  What really sets this toy apart though is that each car (2 included; more for sale) has a very distinct set of 3 special powers and also different base attributes, like in many racing video games.  The cars can attack each other and it is fun even just to watch.  Each car is controlled by an android or iOS device (not included) and the controls are surprisingly tight and refined. I would recommend it mostly for ages 6+ but some 5 year olds may be able to handle the controls. There really is no upper limit for age; it is just such a fun toy.  I especially like how even though it uses electronics it really is not a digital experience and is more social and constructive than video games.

"Rest assured, this is a terrific product. It works well, it has a superior product design, is extremely durable and, while it looks ramrod straight, it is in reality as maneuverable as a team of gymnasts.Plainly put, if you like the way it looks you wont be disappointed. It is what the ad says: a great lamp.Heres what I like about it: First, I love its design. It has a sleek modern look, but I think it will fit into lot of decors. I like its disguised simplicity: while it bears an initial similarity to a large hair straightener, this is deceptive in ways beyond the obvious.  A little over a foot in length (about 14-15), it has an interesting technology behind it that produces a diffuse light beam that doesnt glare like the old desk lamps from when I was young. This is not to say it isnt bright; it is. Quite. But it doesnt hurt your eyes when youre working nearbyand it is easier to understand when you look at the schematic they provide about why that is (Ill leave it to you to read the product info).There are also a lot of forms it can take: it can be bent into a lot of different variations from the norm. Straight up, bent this way, bent that way, tilt the head away, tilt it towardit really has a wide array of ways that this can be used. And it has three brightness levels for whatever use it might be designated for, the time of day, and so on. And if you dont like cords you can even unplug it. The lamp will work for 8 hours without being plugged in. Not that its made for this, but you can even use it as a rather oddly shaped and purposed flashlight. It doesnt even have to go on a deskthere is a small aperture through which a hook/fastener can attach to it and it can be hung from a wall.But beyond its looks, which again, I like a lot, it simply works well. Twist it this way or that, youre going to hear a click. Things simply lock in place, and youll feel like the product is going to stay in the formation you set it in. Its REALLY designed cleverly.About all I can say as points of advice are:Make the base of the lamp either a little larger, or heavier or both. There are a couple of configurations that I would love to set up where the lamp cannot stand, or does so for a while and then tips. While I love the wide array of choices, there are indeed a couple that don't work, and it's almost always because the base cannot support the configuration. Again, I must point out this is very definitely in the minority.Consider other shades/colors: black, silver, grey  even colors. I love the white, but I think other shades would increase its marketability.But other than that I can hardly think of any other suggestions; its darn near perfect as it is.NOTE: I was given a free sample of this product with no stipulation other than I provide an honest review...which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17QU940JKS5HC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AEDO5M#wasThisHelpful","R17QU940JKS5HC","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Aoneky Magnifying Glass is near perfect: I like its look and I very much like the clarity it delivers when it comes to reading the fine print on so many products nowadays. (If youll permit me this one sort of off-base rant: why do so many shower hair products make their print unreadable in the ONE PLACE NO ONE CAN WEAR GLASSES!?)Additionally, if you are at all like me I love to look through optical devices. I love kaleidoscopes, I love crystal, I love telescopes,, and I love magnifying glasses. There are all sorts of things one can discover with them: small print, little doo dads, bugs (sorry, women), the miniature nature of mechanical objects  you name it: theres a whole world out there waiting to be discovered.And so, back to the Aoneky Magnifying Glass: I like how crystal clear the product renders small objects, and it is easy to hold and delivers a very readable and legible lucidity to small print when the lens is held at out six inches off the surface of whatever Im reading (a very easy-to-attain distance). Ive also noticed it allows my face to be a good foot away from the surface of the lens  again, a very easy-to-attain distance. I say this because I am a back pain sufferer and have no ability to maintain my posture in some bent-over position for ANY length of time. And this is, I am sure, a problem MANY people face who need the magnifying glass: Okay, yes, OLD people. Like me.A really nice thing is also that the lens is indeed made of glass. Thats a significant thing: plastic warps under light, and it can scratch and get cloudy with time. And yes, glass can scratch too, but it is at least a fault that IS avoidable with a little care. (Things like cloudy plasticnot so much.)I also like that the magnifying glass has some heft to it  while the rosewood handle is attractive, it is act ually quite light, but the glass and its rim are, together a little weighty  about 5 and a half ounces, or a third of a pound. Thats extremely light overall, I think most will agree, but that small amount of weight gives the lens and frame a little substance which I think makes it much easier to handle that way. I find that the lighter something is the easier it is to fumble around  and harder to hold steady. Without heft, the lens would be simply too easy to let slip in and out of focal range. That heft gives it mass without making it burdensome.Now, mind you, the heft SHOULD NOT give anyone a problem. I say this knowing there are extreme cases. For instance, though a certain older woman but-not-exactly-my-mother passed away some time ago and I honestly COULD see her complaining about something like this. In fact, there was practially nothing on this planet that could not have some fault or the other, and in this case I can see her telling me that the Aoneky is too heavy for her to hold it. Perhaps that is why the handle is able to be unscrewed (something I talk about in the next paragraph). It might give those who dont want the weight at the end of a handle  the rule of the fulcrum and all  so it is possible that unscrewing the handle and letting the person hold the brass frame itself may help, but I think thats really being quite picky.As to that handle: I dont prefer it being removable. I say this knowing that Ive just come up with a (very picky) reason why one might want it to be, but it still doesnt thrill me. To even argue against myself further I suppose that it might allow some to work more easily in some cases, like a crowded workspace or some kind of greater maneuverability, but I am still not a big believer in it. But, EVEN IF IT WERE IMPORTANT: why, oh why does it have to ALWAYS COME LOOSE? The handle is forever loose! I find it very distracting and, mind you, I really like the magnifying glass. But even given all those other things, why does the little nub at the otherwise entirely superfluous metal nib come loose? And worse, it is always falling off  is it so that we will store secret messages within the hollow handle?  Come to think of it, maybe Ill do that myself. Right after I glue the little sucker on permanently. To my way of thinking, this is a problem that doesnt have to exist.To close up, while I dont like that those two parts come loose easily, I do very much like the Aoneky Magnifying Glass. I am an inveterate Saver of Things, and I now keep my Aoneky in an old fuzzy felt-like bag with a drawstring at the end, and that keeps the magnifier nearby without letting it get scratched. Its a nice add-on feature I (and you might) like.All in all, a great product that does me a lot of good in my old age.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IGOLEZOTYPM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0167XFROM#wasThisHelpful","R1IGOLEZOTYPM4","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If youve ever hungered for a low-priced speaker ($34 at the time of this review) that delivers bass as well as it does treble, this is the speaker for you.Im really blown away by how well it reproduces sound like a much more expensive speaker  while most of these inexpensive products deliver higher pitch music through tweeters quite effectively, its the woofers that never seem to effect a very powerful sound. Here, though, the solution is provided by a mere three letters (and a hyphen if youre counting): a SUB-woofer is doing the work here, and it does a terrific job.Woofers (which got the name for reproducing a dogs low-pitched bark) work in the lower range of human hearing: somewhere around 20 to somewhere below 20,000 Hz. But a sub-woofer is more specific: it usually specializes in the 20-200 Hz. range, and thats what youre hearing with this speaker. Interestingly enough, sub-woofers only really became an issue when computerization of sound became so sophisticated that we could really faithfully reproduce this  lower range  which often substituted volume for intensity  was accessible to the products the average person could own that reproduced this sound  like CDs, for instance.Now, please note that Im putting this in commonly referred to generalities: I havent seen any exact specs when it comes to this speaker. But put me down as a believer: Ive heard this speaker and I love it, and its now my go-to at home for reproducing sound off my little laptop, and for once Im REALLY impressed by the sound my (nothing special musically) Sony Vaio makes.Theres a picture I-Venstar supplies that makes these speakers look huge  it dominates the picnic blanketl being used by two joyous romantics  but to me this is using the wrong kind of psychology. Its the tiny-ness of these speakers that makes the great sound quality so extraordinary: its about as big as a loaf of Melba toast as long as my outstretched hand. (Maybe if a congregation of ants were to carry it off under their stunned supervision.) Call me crazy, but I think its relatively small size is a terrific selling point: being able to transport great sound in a package smaller than a tube of tennis balls is pretty sensational  at least to me. (See my picture of it compared to a universal DirecTV remote.)Anyway, the speakers are rubberized and seem virtually indestructible to everyday use. It also helps it be ""grippy"" on smooth surfaces, so even placing it on a slightly slope-y incline is usually no problem. NOTE: I-Venstar says it is water resistant but warns not to submerge it. (Hence: use near the shower, not IN it.) It operates off a Li-ion battery, and has jacks for connection through micro USB or 3.5mm audio cable if you wish.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33IJ31YC8PKKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012FIQJY0#wasThisHelpful","R33IJ31YC8PKKC","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my third or fourth different review for glass screen protectors, and if you've read the others please realize I might repeat myself a bit.

In my experience, glass provides a truer, more authentic image than does plastic. That's true from the first minutes of its use and only gets better as time goes on. Glass cleans up better; I find that with plastic there is a certain degradation due to build up no matter how much you clean it. Glass holds up better than plastic.The thing I really like about glass screen protectors is how hard they are and how sharp the image comes through. I cant tell you how often I look at my screen and say, Wow! to myself because of how remarkable the bright, striking image looks. Im not making this up: take care of your screen, keep it under glass and keep that glass clean (and not simply by rubbing it on your pants or with your shirt-tail) and youll see what I mean.But this is important: take reasonable care of your screen protector  that is, keeping it clean and not wiping it off on your sooty OshKoshes after a day of roadwork, the GLASS protectors look beautiful; even stunningly so  depending of your care of them. I keep little packets of Zeiss Pre-Moistened Lens Cleaning Wipes nearby (they cost only about six cents per wipe) for my phone, tablet, and my glasses and the result is worth it.Now, as to whether the ballistic glass is actually more responsive due to the improved technical process that allows it to be thinner than standard glass screens, time will tell. More on that laterI've seen that some reviews have complained that the instructions weren't complete or that they weren't clear, but I did not encounter that problem. I thought the instructions included were pretty clear and besides, the kit included a URL address for an installation video that spelled everything out even clearer. I think installing glass screen protectors is WAY easier than plastic ones, especially when it comes to bubbles. As I said earlier, I've installed several glass protectors and I find that bubbles are quite easy to clear up in glass, while plastic installation is pretty problematic that way.The only reason I deducted a point off the final score is that I felt Exheed could do better when it came to the double package it provides of screen protectors. Specifically, while Exheed includes two screen protectors, they only supply one of the little alcohol wipes and only one of the little tape removal sheets, two items that are really important when it comes to making a proper cleaning of the surface upon which the glass is placed. Granted, if you're doing two phones at once then you can probably get by with only one of each. But if you're being frugal or cautious and are going to set the other one aside, then you have don't have the proper prep kit anymore.Otherwise, this is a great kit.NOTE: I was given a free sample of this product with no stipulation other than I provide an honest review...which this is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JTQ5NBFQWL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4JZWTI#wasThisHelpful","R3JTQ5NBFQWL6","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am maybe the perfect example of a person who gets tremendous value from this little kit. I am a card-carrying House Husband right now. My wife works hard outside of the house.Ive never taken any real sewing lesson other than watching my mom do this kind of work (much better on her worst day than I ever could on my best) and asking questions of herand all this 30 to 40 years ago. I dont buy sewing magazines. I only occasionally see Pinterest pages (which I admit I love) and I have no projects Im working on. I am NOT especially talented. But I know how to do basic work and I know when a kit like this comes out an gives us a great little product.1. + ITS GOT A SECURE LITTLE BOX:It has a nice, easy to open format and a hard but not too thick structure to it. If it falls the kit holds together as long as its zipped shut.2. + ONCE OPENED, EVERYTHINGS IN A LOGICAL ORDER:Even a guy like me knows where stuff is hereits all very visible and makes sense. The two exceptions are the pins and safety pins, whose bags I wish were strapped in a little betterIm always picking them up off the ground (but theyre at least in bags, which helps).3. + THE THREAD COLORS WERE REALLY WELL PICKED:Intuition tells me there will be some disagreement as to this, but I like these colors and shades. I know Im not the most intelligent or fashionable person, but they look like great choices in colorsthey have a great deal of range and (I think) they represent a pretty full range of colors.4. + EVERYTHING ELSE IS OF VALUE:Youve probably seen the list: lots of sewing needles and threads, scissors and a standard but nice little thread cutter. I was a little put off when a needle bent quite early into its use. I think I was probably using it against its ability level (I was trying to mend a tear in my couch, and perhaps the material was a little too tough for it.) Still, it didn't last very long.5.  I WOULD HAVE LIKED A LARGER THIMBLE:There are times I have to get needles through tough fabric: a couple of layers of jeans, for instance, or worse. Even tough guys will use a thimble (though maybe they look over their shoulders before taking it out).6. + THEYVE INCLUDED TWO THREADING HELPERS:Good for them. I always have trouble finding them, and an extra one will do a lot of good. One came apart though, right after I used it for about four or five threadings, and when I tried to fix it the backing just collapsed under my fingers.. Lucky for the extra one.7. + /- THEY HAVE WHAT APPEARS TO BE A GOOD GUARANTEE (BUT ITS NOT WRITTEN OUT)They do however ask you to email their offices about any problem with their product, and promise 100 percent satisfaction.In closing, it bears mentioning that my mother actually gave me a little kit like this when I headed off to college.ALMOST HALF A CENTURY AGO. No lie. Anyway, I still have it and, more importantly, I still use it. I add a button here or there, and I get a little thread here or there, but the kit is basically the same.  And now that kit may retire to the back of the closet while this new kit takes over. I think its probably earned its rest.So, four stars: it's a good kit, and has a lot to offer for it, but some of the earliest uses terminated two of the products. But there were a lot of others to take its place.NOTE: I was supplied with this product free of charge with the sole stipulation that I provide an unbiased review, which this is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q0AMT0L6UEGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014F4LCRQ#wasThisHelpful","R3Q0AMT0L6UEGP","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being retired and not having done any Christmas shopping yet, I havent run into any RFID scanners recently. RFIDs are the Radio Frequency Identification information that are encoded within the magnetic strips on your credit and store cards, and they are in definite need of being protected from outside illegal scanning...how often do we hear of ID theft and the horrors associated with it?So in this particular case (and I assume, most others), my review will have to operate on the assumption that the cards offered by RFID Secure do indeed protect the cards from being scannedwhich I believe is a safe assumption. That being said, what matters is1 HOW EASY THEY ARE TO USEAs one might expect, these cards couldnt be simpler to use and the card fits neatly inside. Theyre just about a perfect sleeve within, too: not sticky, but not too slide-y either.2 HOW WELL THEY FITAbout the only negative I could come up with is really picky. Simply put, while the sleeves easily fit the main pockets allotted them, these sleeves dont fit within some of the slots where wallets typically allow placement of credit cards or other similar cards. In other words, if you want the cards to ""wear"" the sleeves as protection, yo'll have to be very mindful of finding very particular wallets or other methods of holding them. (Truthfully, given the importance of protecting ones personal information nowadays, I might consider whether the wallet goes before the sleeves. REALLYin fact, it might be wise for companies to consider.)OVERALL:I do not have a passport, so I did not find a use for that particular sleeve. As for the ones I did use, I selected the rather straightforward white sleeves because I liked their simplicity. I suppose down the road there will be all sorts of colors and styles. I think the overall ratings are a great indication of how well this product works: at the time of this review there were 95 % of them at 4s and 5s (with 82 % being 5). Those are HIGH numbers.So, yes, I have been really pleased with the sleeves, and feel the RFID Secure people have done a nice job with designing them so that they are about as snug as one could expect a sleeve could be. You really cant fit another card within, and I could find no portion one could really shorten or reduce otherwise. Theyre effective, theyre easy to use, theyre made just about perfectly, and they look good. Thats just about perfect in my book.NOTE: I was supplied with this product free of charge with the sole stipulation that I provide an unbiased review, which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R203NW1TT86VV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WNCQ1GK#wasThisHelpful","R203NW1TT86VV","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first reaction to the Raqpak Reflective Cord came as I took it out of the bag and I saw the striking yellow color and reflective propertiesthis rope really looks cool.My second reaction was one of relative amazement as it came completely out of the bag: it was really compact, measuring lengthwise about the size of my outstretched hand, and its bundled thickness was a close to the size of my  fist.But I became hooked if youll pardon the pun, when I began using it on little projects outside the house: I strung it up on our old clothesline to see how it held weight over a distance of 25 feet. To test this, about two days ago I tied one end of the old clothesline T (that was still up, obviously), pulled it over the opposite end and pulled tight and anchored it. There was almost no feeling of stretching once it reached its maximum length, and I took that as a good sign: you dont want tent lines, say, to stretch.Anyway, it was fine for clothes I took some items out on hangers and it held up well. For a thin cord it had a great tensile strength and showed no signs of breaking. Additionally, the terrific ""reflectivity"" of the strands makes the cords really show up when I went into the yard at night: Whereas I frequently scalp myself (there are some areas in the yard where the clothesline is at right about high forehead height, which is hilarious to my much shorter wife and children. Well, the jokes on them now, because Ill always see the cord ahead of time  (unless Im wearing my darn ball cap, like last night, and the bill obscures itOUCH! No fault of the rope there.)I also cut a few lengths of it and used them to tie up wood bundles and they held greatthe bundles were about the size of the ones you see at grocery stores and held about six forearm-length wood sections. With these little bundles you have to use two strings on each bundle, as the wood would shift too much with only one string. It held great.The great thing about this cord is how brightly it reflects: you can see this at night REALLY easily as long as there is a light source somewhere nearby so it can reflect. This makes it super intelligent to use as say, tent cords, as any late night trips that usually end with someone tripping over them. The danger in falling is not only the tripping over the string, but also the persons possible landing into one of the pegs pounded into the groundsome of those pegs are metal and can cut the person falling on them. My sister needed stitches one summer because of them.While the cord is really thin  about the width of shoelaces  it is really strong. The company says it has a 360-pound break strength, and I can believe it. As I said before, I think this is probably a terrific cord for small tasks where string is NOT an option and you dont need full ropes. As it is VERY light  the whole 100 foot cord runs in the area of five ounces, counting the bag it comes in  and this makes it extremely wise for camping. It adds almost no weight to your camping gear.This is an excellent cord to have around for all sorts of reasons. Now that I own it I know that if I were ever to go camping again I would HAVE TO take this cord.. i could be either cut ahead of time to make putting up a tent ahead of time, or it could simply be brought along to help with any number of uses on an outing: bundling items, setting traps, clothesline, hanging up food to keep it free from pests, shoelaces, lashing down gear and so on.NOTE: I was supplied with this product free of charge with the sole stipulation that I provide an unbiased review, which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R372UO3P1VRD9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EJ528G#wasThisHelpful","R372UO3P1VRD9S","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first reaction when I received this Camping Light was how tiny it was: so compact that it easily fits into my pocket. But if I thought its LENGTH was tiny, I was still in for another shock:I looked at the bulb. About the diameter of the head of a finishing nail  or for those unfamiliar with nail sizes, think of it this way: see this O? It would fit in that circlewith room to spare.But heres a case where size doesnt matter: while I wouldnt use it to read by, it will certainly illuminate your room, take you around outside the house on a moonless night, take away your fears in the dark basement of your house (well, at least some of them), help you find things under the couch, and so on and so on. Its really a fine little illuminating aid.And whats even better is that it has this slidey little end (where the transparent plastic sheathe is), that allows you to adjust it by sliding the bulb closer to the little metal dish at the end of the sheath, or move the dish away from the bulb and allow the light to become diffused through its hazy plastic sides.One of the things I really like about this flashlight is that it not only has the ability to either blip three times fast (and then faster), but it doesnt have to happen EVERY time, thereby freeing you from having to cycle through the unnecessary steps every time you use it. True, if you click it in a regular on, then off, then on, then off, etc. pattern you will travel through the five cycles: 100%, 50%, 25%, fast strobe, slow strobe (or SOS). If you pause at any point, however, you will break the pattern and have to start over. I LOVE THAT. Im so glad that it makes you follow a short specific sequence to bring it about, and does not occur EVERY time you turn your flashlight on and off  which is a major pain.I also like that the sliding mechanism can be used by the person holding it in one hand WITHOUT having to use the other hand. The one-handed operation  helps an great deal when, say, you're near the edge of the woods, or on the side of the road changing a tire, or any other scenario, when you hear a noise. If you're carrying something you do NOT have to put it down to use the little sliding mechanism...which really simplifies things.A few closing facts: the supplied battery is an 18650 battery, which Im finding is getting more common nowadays. One tiny downer: I did not receive an orange filter with my battery, but I have decided to live on without it. And finally, there is a small colorful lanyard that comes with it, which I found supplies an added benefit if you attach it: it prevents your flashlight from rolling off the surface its on. Thats a nice little feature..in addition, it should be mentioned that the one-handed operation of the device I just mentioned -- the sliding feature -- is that much better when you're wearing the lanyard. It really eases operating the device with one hand when you're absolutely sure you won't drop it.NOTE: I was supplied with this product free of charge with the sole stipulation that I provide an unbiased review, which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33CMN0PWKEAPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014189FBG#wasThisHelpful","R33CMN0PWKEAPH","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE LOST FLEET: FEARLESS is a terrific book in its own right, and also as an important book in the series. While it continues the strong writing of author Jack Campbell (a pseudonym for John G. Hemry), it also quite necessarily advances the central conflicts within the novel AND the series.Of course, there are the Syndics (The Syndicate has been at war with the Alliance ever since the time of Acting Commander John Gearys century-long hibernation), but the beauty of the authors writing comes from his ability to keep several metaphorical plates spinning at the same time. Not only does he have to return his fleet to their allies along with the hypernet key they successfully smuggled away, but he must do so while continually proving his abilities as a leader to this men (a term that in the military applies to women as well). At the same time he must prove to them that he is John Geary the man, not Black Jack Geary the legend  while he doesnt mind using the alias to psych out his enemy, he knows that his legendary status is just too impossible to maintain. He fears (and rightly so) that the greatest challenge he will face is when that image finally falters in their eyes and they are crushed by the realization.Another interesting aspect about keeping the legendary Black Jack identity at bay is that it employs the otherwise secondary character of Madam Co-President Victoria Rione as a restraining force on his continual rise to greater acceptance, and this is important in two ways. First, it serves as a check as to whether or not he is becoming too powerful, and then in an equally important role for the reader Rione often serves as a foil for Geary. She is a character who helps project or define his character traits  as well as a clarifier of his tactics, motivation, or any other aspect the reader is likely to need explained.As a prime example, early in the novel Geary invites Rione to sit beside him to explain rumors she may be privy to, and she offers the following:You know I distrust youAt first it was because I feared the hero worship that could make you as big a threat to the Alliance and this fleet as the Syndics. Now its because of that, and because youve proven yourself a very capable man. The combination is very dangerous. I like Rione, though I admit she can sometimes be a bit repetitive with her negativity. Overall, though, I think Campbell makes good use of her as a valuable check on Gearys power.And that power gets a severe test in this book: when they free a Syndic penal colony one of the men they liberate is a legend himself: captured two decades ago, Captain Fighting Falco is a man as gifted at self-promotion as he is at compelling his men to fight the enemy. When Geary refuses the mans offer to take the fleet on a very dangerous mission, Falco feels Geary to be too timid and he mutinies, taking a sizeable chunk of the fleet with him. Again, it is time again for Geary to be tested and to see if he is worthy of the command he now holds.One other thing: though there is more fighting in this book than there was in DAUNTLESS, the first novel in the series, it is still a credit to the author that his novel can maintain itself as a military sci-fi while still being a book that primarily discusses factors such as discipline, strategy, ethics, leadership, the abuse of power, and other dynamics of war and leadership that I find fascinating. I was a high school teacher, and when Campbell writes about war I find that his book teaches me as well, showing me how to use leadership as a way to motivate those I lead without demeaning them, to lead with positivity and wisdom and openness.  I find these books fascinating in that regard.Its a testament to his skill that he does it so well. Its obvious from Campbells writing he was not only a Navy lieutenant commander, but also a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy: his tactics at constructing a complex fleet-wide battle scenario are well-described and boast a strong sense of logic,-- interesting particularly because he must do this in a naval conflict that adds one full dimension to a battle on water.Two last notes: First, ever since the first book I was enthralled with the authors decision to emphasize the physics of relativity and distance when it comes to space battle: its battles have a slow and almost maddening pace to them, since millions of kilometers are being crossed every minute. Messages take seemingly forever to reach their counterparts, as to the weaponry and maneuvering.  So many books and movies paint space battles as taking no more time than across a field, and its refreshing to see how Campbell denies such tactics as scientifically false.Second, and finally: there is a two distinct things being foreshadowed in this book, and both have something to do with the hypernet gates. I will not discuss them except to say that while one has to do with scientific considerations, the other has to do with boundaries, and the implications of just how these gates came into the hands of the Syndics. Both are potentially powerful when it comes to further installments of the series, and I look forward to their impending developments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RDI1F68B1DLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857681311#wasThisHelpful","R3RDI1F68B1DLK","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was young I was playing with my brother and at a key moment I zigged when he zagged. His face hit the edge of our coffee table and the collision opened a gushing wound above his eye that required several stitches to close itthere was so much blood that I was more traumatized, I think, than my brother was.The odd thing was that the coffee tables edges were extremely blunt. The edge probably took  to  of an inch on the horizontal AND  the vertical to carry out the edge. But the edge was wood, and my brothers skin was between it and his skull and, well, something gave. Horribly.In retrospect, the Edge Mellow Edge & Corner Cushion would have been a great solution. It is a quality product that should make the edges of any table, shelf, desk or safe...in fact, its SO cushioning and safe that you have to be sure, I think, to avoid using it on anything like stairs for fear that it might trip people. AND it might make for a fun thing for children to play with, as it does present itself as a very pleasant-feeling object that they might want to pick at.The process of applying it as almost a no brainer. It comes with double sided tape that goes on the interior of the edging and then the edging material simply is pressed to the corner or edging youre trying to protect. The directions it comes with are easy to follow as well. They warn you about things like making sure to measure it first before laying out the edgingyou dont want to stretch or bunch the materials; as you can assume, that would compromise the longevity of your cushioning. Also, be aware of the wood finishing, and so on)Other than the two things Ive mentioned (that children might pick at it and that its so large that you shouldnt use it where footing is involved), I would only mention that its a bit expensive: $1 per foot. I know that its a lot less than hospital bills, so that should outweigh all other considerations, but consider that a coffee table thats about 5 feet by about 2  feet will cost about $15. Should you have a couple of end tables, a TV stand, shelves, and so on, it could mount up. But again: the trauma it will save you is really worth it: imagine sitting in an emergency room and looking at your childs face: thats worth a bit more than a $1 a foot, Im sure. (And all products that I checked  quickly  cost about the same.)(Plus, remember that you only have to cover EXPOSED corners and edgesif half the end table is against the wall and, say, a chair, you dont have to cover those edges. That helps.)This kit comes with 18 feet of cushioning and four corners.NOTE: I was supplied with this product free of charge with the sole stipulation that I provide an unbiased review, which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YOE1SBNI02R8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012IB64MQ#wasThisHelpful","R2YOE1SBNI02R8","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit that I seem to have a weakness for anything that G4Free puts out: their line of bags is without fail wisely conceived and well manufactured out of strong, durable materials. This bag is no exception.This Tactical Waist Pack  which is to me a more tech-savvy way of saying fanny pack, (more on that later) shows their typical use of high quality material and smart workmanship, with no skimping anywhere along the process. Just handling it gives you that feel of a great product: a strong, durable high intensity 600D polyester fabric and really great stitching, nicely squared seams, etc.As for the aforementioned D, I did a little checking, and found that the D refers Denier, a term  get readythat designates the fabrics weight (in grams) when it came to the standard 9,000 meters of that fiber. All that essentially means is more or less what youd think: that 600D polyester is stronger than, say, 400D polyester; 600D nylon is stronger than 400D nylon, etc. (And nylon is incidentally stronger than polyester, if you wanted to know.)  Polyester is used in particular for its propensity toward water resistance and durability.All stitching is extremely professional and all seams are well secured. Seams are stitched in accordance with necessity  that is, most seams are single stitched, but there is double stitching where necessary.  I found no loose stitching, or even threads that extended past their seams (at the ends, where a lot of less stringently stitched products might let threads hang at their ends  a minor inconvenience, meaning little except as a sign of professionalism).One of the reasons this is no longer termed a fanny pack, by the way, is that the bag is highly versatile and can be carried in different mannerssuch as over the shoulder (which a lot of men, especially, prefer..also, we hate the term ""fanny pack""). As such, this bag includes a strap with clips at both ends for a fast changeover.As for construction, up front is a small pouch that is covered by a velcroed lid, and this pouch can carry things around the size of a cigarette pack or deck of cards, a cell phone, etc. Behind it the spacious main compartment is zippered, and its dimensions are approximately 10 wide, 5 deep, and 5 tall. It would easily carry paperback books, larger cellphones, wallets, passport, foodwhat have you. Outside, on each end can be found side nets which allow for, again, a variety of small items to be placed within: smaller cellphones, pens, cigarettes, small cameras, keys, etc. The side nets are closeable by a nice rope that has a clasp that allows it to be tightened or loosened to exactly the dimensions you wish. ..therefore, a plastic bottle of water could fit within because once the nets rope is tightened, there would be no problem that the neck of the bottle would extend higher than the pouch. And, finally, behind the main pouch there is a thick padding that makes the pack extremely comfortable to carry around the waist.There are ample clips and clasps that come into play around the bag that allow for the products belt and other items to be attached to or tightened to your own specifications.Additionally, there is no shortage of, for a lack of better terminology, loops  though that term does not really do it justice. These consist of fabric sewn in such a manner that items can be slid through and securely carried: the strap, for instance, when not in use, or a small collapsible hat, or anything that could be rolled and slipped within.The bag comes in camouflage, black and tan, and the warranty information was not clearly stated at the time of this review (which Ive noticed is true of their other bags). I will tell you that I dont see much going wrong with this bag, but if you are worried about such things you can contact the manufacturer.NOTE: I received a free sample bag with no other stipulation than I write an unbiased review, which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MRXM2W55GJZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012364TCI#wasThisHelpful","R1MRXM2W55GJZP","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is listed as having six pockets, and Id swear it has more. Every time I unzip this or unfold that or look behind here or there I find another one.I know this is intended for an around-the-neck use, but I have found that its also an excellent product to use within a back packslide it into an appropriately sized portion of the pack, and it really organizes a lot of otherwise problematic material: IDs, store passes, checkbook(s), a few pens or pencilsyou name it, having something like this within your pack gets a lot of stuff out of the way.However you use it, its a great organizer. It has two long zippered pockets (one on each side, vertically placed); a clear plastic ID slot; a big pocket that runs pretty much the whole length and breadth of the pouch; then ANOTHER one right behind it, both topped by the same cover (that has a small zippered pocket itself); then right behind that is YET ANOTHER similarly sized pocket backed by a mesh.Additionally, the passport holder is made of RFID-blocking material (which protects the identity-sensitive cards from being accessed by programs which can attempt to access those codes), and at the same time that material is moisture resistant...protecting the items within from moisture like rain as well as sweat.As to its quality, the stitching is uniform and all seams and materials appear to be top-notch.

"Owning a small farm, I have grown to appreciate having certain things which, when needed, live up to their potential. Sure, its nice to find a plastic product every so often and benefit from its inexpensive quality, but I often find that there are those products which just DO NOT hold up when made from plastic. This is a great example.This kind of a hose connector MUST hold the hose tightly and at the same time deliver the necessary amount of water. Yet time and again those plastic connectors lose their threads  or the on/off function gives way or any number of other problems occur, and whatever you THINK you saved comes up and bites you on the butt.BRASS WORKS. It may cost a little more at the onset, but it is SO worth it.This Y connector is a quality product. Ive used it for a couple of weeks now, and I find that it holds up extremely well.And yes, the connector uses plastic parts, but they are only buffering the actual metal part beneath it: the switches have a softer plastic covering them so that the metal doesnt cut into your finger, and likewise the plastic ring around the central connector that meets up with the faucet does much the same.Im impressed with this Y connector, and recommend it strongly.NOTE: I was supplied with this product free of charge with the sole stipulation that I provide an unbiased review, which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R64FC0O3UOM5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144B77O2#wasThisHelpful","R64FC0O3UOM5U","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I took my computer out of the box I was immediately impressed. Mine is the model depicted on the products page  a white tablet within a black leather case  and I like the way it looks quite a bit. The case is a stiff, protective leather and seems well made: a bright white stitching around the edges of both sides is attractive in a minimalist manner, and I have no doubt that it will hold up for a very reasonable amount of time. The tablet itself is held in place by four metal tabs that grip it firmly.As for protection, I think the case does reasonably well as a first-line of defense. I have dropped the case from my seat to the floorprobably about 15-18 inches, and the tablet held up fine. I did notice that one of the tabs slipped a bit, and I dont know if it would hold up well if one were to allow it to, say, cartwheel down a flight of stairs, but thats in my opinion probably a bit past the limit of what a computer case should be asked to do. If protection is your biggest concern, I would place this product inside a larger briefcase or bookbag, one that would encase it more securely.The tablets interface is like that of your typical Android computer, and is pretty easy to navigate. Irulu includes a small and relatively simple manual to make startup and the basics clear, but being the proud possessor of a Y chromosome I set that aside early on and muddled through it on my own. While I did make the occasional blunder, I found it easy to get the handle of the basics very quickly, despite the fact that  as my wife will be glad to tell you  I am no genius on these things.Upon startup I was a little concerned the product might display its low cost: the immediate graphics in the first thirty or so seconds are relatively blocky and dull. But, luckily, after that I was VERY impressed. Using the supplied Google-included programs really spoke volumes about how nice this tablet is. I played several  very involved YouTube videos from suppliers like the CGBrothers (a great little site to subscribe to, by the way if youre into art, popular entertainment, fantasy and sci-fi). I set playback at 780p and, waiting no more than a few seconds to let each video spool out a little (to avoid pausing during play) I was VERY happy with both the picture (which was terrific) and the sound. The sound was decent on the tablets own merits and GREAT when I used earphones. For a low cost and small-ish 7 tablet I was really delighted.I played a few games that demanded good graphics and was similarly pleased. The Ihuru tablets graphics held up well, and gameplay went on without any real hitches. I found that about anything my phone could do well, this Irulu did well, too.I was a bit disappointed with the camera: when I photographed with it I thought that the pictures came out green-tinted. It should be stressed that I did NOT spend very much time trying to fine-tune this aspect. I would guess there are settings or program software fixes that will remedy this, but I am not a genius in this area and would recommend  your looking at other reviewers to see if they fared better.I downloaded Microsoft Words basic word-processing program and installation was simple. Upon usage, however, I found my first real problems with the tablet...in particular, its keypad. Simply put, I had a problem using the small keyboard supplied alongside the tablet. I have average-sized hands with somewhat stubby fingers, and I had a lot of issues with fitting my hands on the board. Eventually I was reduced to the single-fingered hunt-and-peck method of using one or two fingers on each hand to type out what I wanted to write. I think there is a distinct possibility that small women and, most likely, children will do much better. I do not think bigger hands will do well. If your hands can fit alongside each other with no more than a 9 wingspan then I think youll do just fine.As for the seven-inch screen, sure, the size is smaller than that of a big monitor. Couple that with the small keyboard and one could draw the conclusion that this is a bit too small. Still, one might do well to consider how well so many of us cope with the restraints placed upon us by our phones. Those keyboards are minuscule, with screens maybe 40 percent of the size of this screen, and I am constantly amazed at how well young people in particular can fly along with their typing on these androids.What this tabloid does do extremely well, therefore, is provide a middle ground for people who want the portability of a something about the size of a trade paperback without having to carry around a laptop or even a netbook. It plays videos and games extremely well, and additionally I think it will provide a lot better screen for those who use road mapping devices: its a lot bigger than the interfaces provided by phones as well as the screens of the old Garmin, Magellan and other GPS screens.While the specifics of the tablet are able to be seen on the product page, it does pay mentioning here that this device has a 16 Gig storage capacity (see NOTE 1 at end), and also has a slot for a Micro SD card allowing up to another 32 Gigs of storage. It weighs in at just one 1 1/4 pounds WITH the case, and will easily fit inside almost anything bigger than an overcoats pocket.And, as Ive mentioned, it has the basic Google operating system within, but it will allow for additional programs to be installed. And there are a zillion free apps available, though your actual counts may vary It has about a seven-hour battery life, and has a front and back camera. It comes with a one-year warranty.NOTE 1: While I am using the product page I was directed to by IRULU, my tablets Storage page states that the tablet has 16 Gigs, not 8.NOTE 2: I received a free sample bag with no other stipulation than I write an unbiased review, which this is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXUEUD8K6WL61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YC53N94#wasThisHelpful","RXUEUD8K6WL61","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow.I have just finished one of the most involved, complex, and enterprising books Ive ever read. While it is safe to say that at various points it is a novel that concerns itself with computer tech, societal metaphor, simulated reality, kidnapping, torture, detective work, quantum physics, alternate dimensions, political statement, romance, media criticism AND pizza, I still dont think Ive come near to covering it all.At the heart of DeepFREAK, however, is a William Gibson-like future in which the influence of computers and the internet are so burrowed into our psyche that it is almost impossible to ferret out where the one ends and the other begins. While it is quite obviously about a future world, it is to the credit of author Mars Dumont (a pseudonym combining two writers identities) that there is much about this world that IS like our own. BUT (and I am stressing this) it is a world in which the authors make no bones about MAKING YOU DO THE WORK. But as taxing as it might be at times, it is really the most honest way to tell their story.For instance, were this story to be immersed in the lives of, say, professional American football players, it would not be a stretch to expect most of their thoughts, words and deeds to be steeped in the jargon of their professionblitzes, the option pass, strong- vs. weak-side, hashmarks, shotgun formation, clipping, snap countsyou get the drift.So, now, consider this short excerpt from Chapter One concerning a character on his way to a market:He noticed the ClosedCircuit TV tracking him to Paranoid blasting in his ear pods. Kool. Reality soundtrack. Invisible drones and CCTV pods transmitting millions of images a second to algorithms crunching petabytes inside LibertyCorp computers. Non-stop surveillance. Facial recognition. Gait analysis. Security is freedom. Got nothing to hide, got nothing to fear, so the adverts said. Mind your own business, and the red lights dont go off. What was deviant was classified but changed all the time anyway. Flash deviant and the nanoDrones were all over you in seconds. Yeah, paranoia was Real. Everything in that paragraph works: little things, like linking a precisely descriptive Black Sabbath song with the ever-present fear these characters wear like a second skin. Its a world in which their concern for freedom has forced them to trade freedoms no American alive before 2001 would ever have done without. Heres where their future links so seamlessly to our presenta post-Patriot Act world in which increased security is freedom, even a world where drones and other surveillance cameras pass along petabytes (millions of billions) of information through shifting algorithms as to what constitutes a correct facial expression (or manner of walking or general persona). Think MINORITY REPORT (the book, movie or TV show).But its more than that: Dumonts terminology also feels right in its lexicon of expression, a world of iCops and creditChips and holo-images; where razz (cool) kids wear lumiDress clothes that are electronically illuminated and programmable; where holo-Artistes create unique holographic 3-D experiences; when wearable direct brain-to-net chips known as neuroNets give one the ability to share feelings electronically.Think: are we really so far from a world like this? And bear in mind that even IN this world there are those who fight such technological short-cuts: at the mild end are the freeGrazers, while at the far end is an elite group of techno anarchists known as (the) Switch.The book begins with a prank conducted by a group of artistic activists called, simply, BLANK. Like todays Anonymous group, here they are disapproving of the Supreme Courts ruling allowing corporations (here, Disney Corp.) to run for the presidency. (Remind you of a recent Supreme Court ruling?)  Blanks protest was a holo-projection of giant mouse ears upon all of the heads on Mount Rushmore  a prank that has authorities stymied, and quite upset.Like I said in the opening paragraphs, DeepFREAK (the term connotes something like a bad drug trip) presents a complex world that Ive simplified for the sake of this review. Its a wise move the authors made when they chose to include a fairly detailed glossary in future editions. The book does take on an incredible amount of subject matter within its pages -- there will be those who complain, Im sure, about the authors choice toward the end to simultaneously involve a really complicated sci-fi slant that decidedly amps the tension, a slant whose scientific validation is REALLY difficult to follow closely (I eventually chose to gloss over the tricky stuff).That aside  yes, DeepFREAK is technologically ornate, but it is a novel that provides readers with a world that seems to be both very much in the future, but is at its core a lot like our own. It is a tale in which the older generation (like me) may find themselves at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to the nuances of computer jargon, but like it or not it IS an unavoidable world thats a-coming. Think of the most indelible image of todays young staring into a hand-held phone as they tap away with their thumbs. And what percentage of us really protest anymore that the main purpose of those store club or member cards is really to track our habits and even our whereabouts? How long will it be before the Google glasses become so commonplace we wonder how we lived without them? And after that the chip in our heads?When that comes, we will inevitably look at books like DeepFREAK and lament just how right they were after all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXLLJXV5OYJWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBKOF0K#wasThisHelpful","RXLLJXV5OYJWO","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you look at the picture at the top of this page, it really lets you see just how small and economical this belt is. You have two pockets in this belt (theres a ONE-pocket companion belt on Amazon a lot like this one here). Both of these belts are really good, and they really only differ in the number of pockets.Both belts have really nice pleats that are tucked behind their zippered pockets that help to increase their size while neither of the pockets are big, they can store large nutrition bars, keys, money, pens and pencils, pillsI surprised myself by placing an uncovered S5 Samsung camera within one quite easily. While the objects within are protected from moisture, the company makes it clear they are not fully waterproofed. In other words, light sweat and light drizzle, even light rain, should not get through. But dont dive into a pool with it  that could leave you disappointed.As to the quality of the belt, I felt it excelled hereall fabrics were securely attached and of high quality and that was true also of the zippers and clips and seams, etc. Additionally, the product really held up well  I pulled on them and twisted them and tried this and that with them and I was very impressed by their workmanship.The belt is made for waists from 27 to 43 inches, but it is constructed of an adjustable elastic strap which extends that waist size by several inches. The company guarantees that the belt will stay in place no matter how rigorous your workout.To sum up, this is a really well made belt that provides exercisers, as well as hikers or those just on a day trip, can use to keep their items secure and, if important, hidden.  This is water-resistant and well made, and should last for years.NOTE: I received a free sample bag with no other stipulation than I write an unbiased review, which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGEKLPIL2ARO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBVVHH4#wasThisHelpful","R1EGEKLPIL2ARO","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bag is a lot like another bag being advertised by the same company, the URPOWER Fitness Running Belt Stretch Waist Fanny Packthe major difference being that the other belt has TWO expandable pouches instead of the one, longer one presented here. Your choice is simple between the two: both are excellent running belts.As one might easily conclude, the pouch in this particular running belt is approximately 8 inches long, and the interior will easily hold the items the pouch describes: ID cards, mobile phone (mines a Samsung s5 WITH a full-sized case with a cover), keys, smartphone, cash, energy bars and power bank. . In fact, (just for fun) I succeeded in packing in on separate occasions  27 full-length sharpened pencils, a pair of bicycle gloves, my 8 long DirecTV remote and, (with a little tugging on the sides) my 3.5 x 5.5 Moleskine notebook.The elastic belt is made to fit any waist size from 24"" to 40"", but I was able to stretch it to fit a 46 circumference. I do believe that might get a little chafe-y, but not if the person just simply wanted to wear it while walking and not jog in it.The materials are all first class, and I didnt see any problematic seams, connections, zippers or connectors. Everything looks well constructed, and I believe the belt is, as claimed, ideal for running, jogging, hiking, and workouts. The belts are advertised as sweat-proof and rain-proof (though, in their words, not fully waterproof).In terms of jogging, the belt fit well and stayed put, even with reasonable items in there. By that I mean I had no problems with items like cash, a couple of energy bars, my keys, a small cellphone or a bigger one without a case, a small notebook and a couple of pens  those kind of things.All in all, this is an excellent product and should do very well for those who are active or those who are simply taking a day trip and wish to carry items in either a hard-to-see location or simply dont have pockets. Either way, this is a quality product, and should not only do what it strives to do and also last for years.NOTE: I received a free sample bag with no other stipulation than I write an unbiased review, which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R68K13P64I50Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBW70TM#wasThisHelpful","R68K13P64I50Y","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a terrific, vibrant, enjoyable and, I'm sure, time-absorbing activity that is loads of fun. I think it's even more of a blast than its hand-drawn counterpart, as all one needs to do is touch it and Voila! the color is applied to the drawing as beautifully as if you'd taken all day to scrupulously color it in yourself by hand.

"While yes, this is in many ways a thriller  and this novel does maintain a strong level of tension until the end  DAUNTLESS is as much a book about war as it is about the conflict between expectations and reality. This is true of not only characterization but ALSO the physics that guides practically everything that moves in this story. For instance, when Captain Geary is looking out on the activities of his massive fleet on the view screen, the time it takes to issue a command and have it realized by the ship(s) is pretty lengthy: usually from one to three minutes of book time, or as much as several times that. Granted (and heres an ironic statement) time is relative when it is being experienced by a books readers, but its so unusual and seemingly authentic that space travel and therefore warfare, too, is NOT Zip! Zap! Zoom! but instead is slowed by the vast distances that must be travelled by 1) ships, 2) weapons and 3) communication. In fact, this slowing-down effect will probably now resonate for me when I read other works, and even when I see sci-fi movies.Author Campbell explains everything without being boring: while this book never mentions our planet Earth  the good guys are Alliance soldiers, while the bad guys belong to the evil-sounding Syndicate side  it does seem entirely possible that this could be about our future.  Regardless, ships generally travel no faster than one-tenth (.1) of the speed of light in battle. They CAN travel up to a breakneck .25 (one-fourth) the speed of light, but because of relativity things begin to distort enough to make targeting, logistics and communication almost impossible. Im no theoretical physicist, but it seems to back up things Ive read.  (To show how fast this still is, traveling at one-tenth the speed of light puts you somewhere around a million miles per minute. While we typically estimate travelling to Mars will take us about six months, we could have made it in less than 40 minutes at .1 SOL if wed made the trip in 2003, when Mars was at its recent closest to us, or about 15 minutes at .25 SOL. Thats fast.)But I think what I like best about this book are the conflicting personalities of the various ship commanders, and therefore the great disputes that those captains have with their new squadron commander. Certainly one can understand conflicts having to do with a fleets new commander, even a celebrated one, as even Black Jacks reputation does not automatically create blind obedience.But its even more than that. Campbell has quite studiously created a fleet that, while futuristic, does not disobey laws of basic human nature.  The author has thought out his fleet and their motivating factors very realistically. This is a force that has been taking staggering losses over the last several decades, and therefore their fleet officers are being promoted into positions of command without properly earning them. They have come to realize that grand gestures reap the notice of their superiors far quicker than the less glamorous notions like strategy and patience. Rear-line officers who witness a stirring victory look for heroes to praise and promote, even if those officers displayed an on-field arrogance that caused the loss of huge troop losses.  Its not the only distortion of honor that Geary has seen rise in prominence during his 100-year absence: so has cruelty in combat, a lack of mercy, and the feeling that the collateral killing of civilians is justified in battle. After all, the Alliance personnel arguethey did it first.And thats what I find so interesting: rather than painting the war, and in particular John Geary, with a wide brush that would make all of the officers and enlisted men and women see him as a glorious hero, author Campbell chooses to dab at his characters with a much finer tool, creating a cast of characters who run the gamut of those who are blindly (or duly) obedient and those who are openly insolent.But when it comes to this the best character is definitely Black Jack himself.  Campbell has created a really interesting person who is neither all patriot or all tradition...while he can be a bit stodgy when it comes to his persistence in trying to bring back the old core conventions, he is always questioning his own actions and challenging himself to come up with ways to appeal to his own officers and men (here meaning non-officers, an armed forces term that includes women) in order to compel his people to be positively motivated.  This is a great book (and, I suppose, series) for those looking at how to motivate people to do their best.While his plan to bring back his troops, ships, and an incredibly important weapon back to his allies back home makes perfect sense to us, a substantial faction of his own men believe his actions show cowardice. He is running from his enemies, they say, frequently refusing to kill those enemies when they show themselves to be weak, as seen by his continual practice of informing a weakened and defenseless enemy that they should surrender.I also love the fact that author Campbell has created another leading character who is a politician, and she represents a small but important faction of the troops under his command. Co-president Victoria Riones presence as a non-combatant is another thorn in his side, but shes an extremely well-placed thorn in his side whose presence is both dramatic and clever, in the sense that his repeated need to explain himself helps involve and inform US, the readers, in a completely natural and fluid manner that does not drag upon the flow of the plot.But what sells this book more than anything else is the skill of the author.  This book is drenched in dramatic tension  and what is so surprising is that so much of it remains yet to be used. For instance, there is really only one actual large battle depicted in this book from start to finishONE battle within a 300-page war novel ! Yet to the authors credit the novel is continually exciting.  What author Campbell has achieved in his creation (and, Im assuming, his series) is a book that is appealing because despite its taking place in the distant future and possibly in a place far, far away  hes created a book that is innately human and eminently readable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R293MC2DOKVLEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073NA4H6#wasThisHelpful","R293MC2DOKVLEL","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a simple and clever concept: a bag that can pack itself. Its so pragmatic that I wish I thought of it on my own.If for no other reason than its convenience and simplicity, this is a really useful bag. But this is not just a cheap convenience: its a well-made and very practical bag that is only limited only by its light, simple construction and strong lightweight tear-resistant fabric. I thought it best to explain these features in the form of a PROS and CONS format that, I hope, will point out why this bag is best when used for the purpose for which it is designed.The bag I examined was the purple choice, and Amazon was offering it for approximately $14 at the time of this reviews publication.PROS:1. This is cleverly designed in its concept and execution. There is one main pocket whose two zippers allow it to be opened just a little in order to take out a single item, or unzipped fully to expose the entire interior.2. Beyond the one giant interior pocket just mentioned, there are two small zippered pockets that could hold, say, a mid-sized e-tablet, and two side pockets that can hold additional items such as a drink bottle or paperback books or food items or other similarly small, soft, or non-sharp objects.3. This is extremely lightweight: its amazingly simple to pack into its own attached bag and store away, as matched only by its simplicity when it comes to unpacking and using as a knapsack.4. Great straps; this is an ideal bag for smaller daytime hikes and bringing along a change of clothes, basic picnic food items, or other goods one would need at a get-together or simply to visit a museum with the family.5. Its an attractive bag, and looks good when its all ironed out; this can also be accomplished by filling it with things like clothes or other goods and simply stretched out6. It is made of tear-resistant nylon, and therefore will avoid tearing even if it does have a small hole. The stitching is reinforced at its seams and its straps are backed by as nylon mesh for the comfort of the wearerCONS:1. The one main pocket is so huge that it dominates what one may access as they walk. Having one main pocket limits ones choice as to single smaller items.2. There are not a lot of smaller pockets in which one can store things needed3. This is extremely lightweight, and it looks as if it shouldnt carry any heavy or sharp-edged products.4. The knapsack lacks a frame found in many larger knapsacks. It is therefore not built for long overnight woodland hikes or hiking on trails5. The nature of the bag is that once it is released from being packed in its small packet, it looks extremely wrinkled and has a messy exterior. It is so lightweight that it seems at a quick glance to be flimsy.As might be gathered when reading the pros and cons, this backpack is at its best when it is used for the purpose for which it is designed. It is not a bag one would take to the Appalachian Trail, but instead it is ideally suited for day trips where one wants to bring along changes of clothes or things to keep younger members occupied on trips to museums or long shopping trips. While it is not at its best if it is packed with extremely heavy single items it IS at its best when those items are soft items like clothes or small toys or food items or smaller thermos containers or a whole host of similar items.Therefore, this bag is a fine choice if one intends to store it away until it is needed. It is the ideal bag for day trips, and is at its best when storing a large amount of baggage. And yes, while it is probably best served by packing soft goods or goods with rounded edges, it IS a durable bag made of tear-resistant nylon and it will resist tearing even if it does indeed have a small hole. This can be seen by a close look at the fabric; that cross-hatching is what prevents the material from ripping any further than the original hole.NOTE: I received a free sample bag with no other stipulation than I write an unbiased review, which this is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12YD42FJ9INS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NGLRL6#wasThisHelpful","R12YD42FJ9INS5","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I often have an interesting conversation with my brother whenever we discuss a sci fi movie or book that involves time travel. His usual complaint: They didnt get Time Travel right, hell argue, to which I always reply that no one gets Time Travel right because IT DOESNT EXIST. His point, though, is one I do agree with, and that is that frequently all it takes is logic to see some problems with plots involving Time Travel.For instance, why do the Terminator-enabling Robots of the Future ALWAYS come back during the period between when the future John Conner, Commander of the Humans, is either about to be conceived through when John Conner is in the young adolescent phase? That decade and a half seems to be a bad period for the robots, right? So: PICK ANOTHER TIME. Go back earlier!! Kill HER mother!Be that as it may, were talking about MR. WAS now, and it's a cleverly written YA novel by Pete Hautman (that happens to use time travel). I believe it to be a fine book that young readers will take to. It contains many of the elements that will appeal to their particular bracket: an alcoholic parent, spousal abuse, a love triangle, identity confusion, war, murder, and an interesting and changing narrative that takes the shape of a series of books obtained by the author.  Oh, and that ever-appealing element of time travel. Well get to that in a moment.Books that play with narrative technique (I AM THE CHEESE, DRACULA, CARRIE, THE BOOK THIEF, FLOWERS WITH ALGERNON, THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN, to name but a few) are often interesting and appealing not only because of their unique nature, but because they come right out and opaquely present the reader with an essential question present in all books: can I trust this narrator? All books  or movies, poetry, or even art  contain such a challenge to the reader, but it is in books parading this narrative element that especially appeal to the young, since they confront it themselves right from the start. They come right out and say: Here I am, and here are the facts as I saw them. Believe me or not; its all up to you.It is an appealing YA technique, and my list at the top of the previous paragraph barely touches the tip of the successful YA iceberg. In one of the most famous cases, J.D. Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE starts off almost admonishing the reader that If you really want to hear about it the narrator could tell you all that David Copperfield kind of crap. So, yes, MR. WAS is a book that from the very start has an appealing tone for the young, wherein P.H., (or Pete Hautman) lets us know that his father rescued an aluminum suitcase bobbing in the surf, and within were four notebooks that have sat in an attic for almost four decades before Mr. H found them and gave them a read. He was so moved by reading them, he tells us, that he has transcribed them to type and, having done so, lets us know that he believes that the events described in Jacks notebooks actually occurred.Having adroitly lent his tale a credible attitude, the author sets out to tell his tale. And here follow the four notebooks. Number One is the longest, and at 110 pages it is best that this is, to me, the most readable and involving portion of the story, the portion in which the central characters are introduced, as well as a very interesting little element known simply as The Door. Since the doors link to time travel is addressed on the back cover, I wouldnt really call it a spoiler to address it, but I will go light on what occurs when he makes several visits through it. Suffice it to say that while at first it was a curiosity, even an escape from the pressures of his life, it later becomes a device where he believes he can use it to amend or even erase some tragic wrongs done in his life.And this is an important element in such tales. We shouldnt use time travel to help us get a better score on a spelling quiz. No: it is a thing that should only used to address Great Wrongs. While most of us have come to expect that old trope to play out  the one that tells us You Cant Change the Past  the question is: will author Hautman  going to obey that particular maxim HERE, in this story? And if such a thing CAN happen, at what price?And, unfortunately, thats where I felt the story bogged a bit. When our central character, Jack, is experiencing life, the story rings true, and tells what is for me the most interesting part of the tale. But when Book Two occurs, wherein Jack meets the shady Mr. Boggs (and his wife, among others), who explains certain elements of time travel to young Jack, that I feel the narrative begins to let us down a bit. While I enjoyed the playful notion that The Door was simply a device, and not a particularly well made one (and leaves us to believe that there must be Other Doors out there), I felt let down by the cheat of the following technique (and I quote):[Mr. Boggs] finally said, Dont worry about it son. You always go back to where you came from, its just that you cant know for sure where youve been(illegible)--you understand?While yes, this is a technique that can certainly be said to safely and truly belong to the authors Bag of Tricks  that is, that since the tale is being transcribed from notebooks found within a suitcase bobbing in the surf, it is perfectly reasonable to expect that parts might be smeared or otherwise illegible, Yet at the same time using it to avoid something crucially explanatory just feels like deception to me: a cheap ruse. It lets the author get away without having to do the hard work, the difficult stuff.And this brings me to the real crux of the Time Travel element. While each Book had its place, and each one described a different facet of the story, I felt a little let down by 1) the immense amount of time that Jack decided to put in to bring about his change, and 2) feeling really let down by the outcome of such a change. I will not reveal plot elements, but suffice it to say that this for me was an immense disappointment. Certainly, it is possible to say I should have seen it coming, but when one goes on a five-decade long trip, one hopes there is more to account for it than this. I almost felt that the book simply ran out of gas by the end.Yet I want to at the same time acknowledge that there is a plot twist later, almost at the very end that (judging by their complimentary reviews) at least one young reader found to be as exhilarating and unexpected as that of THE SIXTH SENSE. I bring this up because I don't want my singular disappointment to be an indictment of EVERYONE's reading of the book. Many, many people loved what they read, including the outcome. (So there, me...)In that light, I believe that there will be many young adults who read this novel who will not only enjoy the narrative device that frames this entire work (the four books within the suitcase), but there will be many who will enjoy the mental gymnastics presented by The Door and its consequences. I think MR WAS will really give many a young reader a workout that will prove enjoyable and rewarding. My young daughters often tell me that I see negatives where they see positives, or vice versa, and such may well be the case here. There are many young peoples testimonies to this novel that it was a book they not only enjoyed but felt it touched them and taught them something at the same time.It is because this book has many strengthsamong them cleverness, interesting characters, a gravity of plot and events that one does not often see in the old YA works that peppered the landscape before this field became completely re-energized in the last couple of decades by such terrific works as J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter series,  Phillip Pullmans HIS DARK MATERIALS, Suzanne Collins THE HUNGER GAMES, Stephanie Meyers' TWILIGHT trilogy, as well as so many other good works that have learned that the best YA fiction does not earn its stripes by being dumbed down, but by challenging young minds with the unexpected, the compelling, and sometimes even the heavier elements like death, cruelty, abuse and other similarly ""adult"" topics.So, all in all, I felt this was a good book that will challenge readers. While I felt that the time travel element took the some of the starch out of an otherwise crisp shirt, this was still a good work that will prove enjoyable to many young readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31A9ABA0B2XLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689819145#wasThisHelpful","R31A9ABA0B2XLL","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For as many times as I write reviews for glass screen protectors for your phones and tablets, Im probably going to say many of the same things: they are beautiful, long lasting and very protective of your screen. I love mine.First, a disclaimer: a glass screen protector does a great job of protecting your screen from scratches, nicks, marks and incidental, even occasional hard hits  depending on the type of hit, the strength of the hit, and the type of object you hit. Screen protectors are not going to protect your phone screen if you drop it on the corner of an anvil, or it is hit by a hammer head, or if you drop it out a car window when youre going sixty. But if youre reasonably protective and you limit dangerous conditions to an incidental hit here or there, the glass screen protector will break before your phone screen does. The best protection for an entire phone combines a screen protector with a wrap-around protector for the body.But as for screen protectors, go glass. Theres a simple reason: when you take reasonable care of your screen protector  that is, keeping it clean and not wiping it off on your OshKoshes after a day of roadwork, the GLASS protectors look beautiful; even stunningly so  depending of your care of them. I keep little packets of Zeiss Pre-Moistened Lens Cleaning Wipes nearby (they cost only about six cents per wipe) for my phone, tablet, and my glasses and the result is worth it.The thing about glass screen protectors is how hard they are and how sharp the image comes through. I cant tell you how often I look at my screen and say, Wow! to myself because of how remarkable the bright, striking image looks. Im not making this up: take care of your screen, keep it under glass and keep that glass clean (and not simply by rubbing it on your pants or with your shirt-tail) and youll see what I mean.And the process of installing glass is much easier than it is with plastic protectors. The plastic ones ALWAYS leave bubbles, no matter how I try. I have followed directions precisely and they STILL leave little bubbles that are next to impossible to remove.But with glass it is extremely simple, and with only a modicum of care and attention to detail your screen will look perfect. Just follow the directions: do what they say, and it should all go well.NOTE: I was given a free sample of this product with no stipulation other than I provide an honest review...which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RQXB8DYSLT3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CKPEBS#wasThisHelpful","R1RQXB8DYSLT3C","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of my dreams come true: a small, easy-to-carry messenger bag that has so many pockets it seems like an electricians tool bag mated with a pool table.I lost count somewhere after I hit a dozen, and I know there are more than that. And what I like best about them is that they all make sense, are located wisely, are mostly covered by zippers or pull strings or stretch fabric or well-placed flaps, making them safe to store items that might normally be easy to lose in other bags. But here the items can be set in their specific placesand one can feel secure that they will stay where they are put.This bag is just perfect for a person like me: I like to write, to keep lists, to doodle, to read, and therefore Im a person who likes to have several pens with me, maybe a couple of pencils, a Kindle or a paperback, a couple of Moleskine-like notebooks; and then of course theres my money, some credit and store cards, my phone, some charging cordsand Im just getting started. I hate when these myriad items have to be dumped into a common bag, where sorting through them is like looking for a coin in a box of fishing tackle.NoI like things to be organized in a set pattern, where I can look for such-and-such a thing even when the lights are out. Having to dump my things into a bag with a couple of sections is no more help to a person like me than if someone else packed it for me. I am not kidding when I say I have gone through a series of bags looking for the right one, and I now know I have found the right bag.The G4Free Multi-functional Tactical Messenger Bag us just what the doctor ordered. The separate pockets are well-sized, offering several medium sized pockets with smaller compartments within, allowing one to organize items into series: for instance, in one medium pocket I can put a wallet, a money clip, a credit card holder, a checkbook, etc  with some of those items in the main pocket, and some of the smaller, lesser-used (or more protected) items are held in the slots within.Another beautiful thing about this bag is thateven with all of these compartmentsit is SO compact.  It manages to encompass all the stuff I carry into a bag that is, when it is pretty well packed with that stuff, about 10 inches wide, about 10 inches tall, and about 6 inches deep. Again, thats FULL. Thats about the size of a large shoe box, which makes it a really easy bag to pick up and carryor fit behind your legs in a crowded car, or stow away in a plane. And, while there are four color choices, I picked black: not only does it look great, but the color is almost invisible through a car window against the floorboardsit removes itself from the temptation of onlookers that way.Its a really terrific bag, like I said. For me, a real keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GF65SGIKS94F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTS3RHS#wasThisHelpful","R2GF65SGIKS94F","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent little organizer for a specific kind of person...and I fit into that category.Some time ago my worsening spinal condition caused me to reevaluate my way of doing things, and one of those things was my George Costanza-like fat wallet that was causing me to sit uncomfortably. A really thick wallet chock full of credit cards and receipts and paper money and what have you is a nightmare on a spine AS WELL AS organization, and a solution had to be found.Well, I've reorganized into several really thin little and very thin containers for my paper and plastic. The beauty of the system is that I can split the cards and money up into three locations on me and because of that it seems like I really am carrying almost nothing....no big billfold to worry about. Or you could simply enjoy this kind of an organizer in a pair of shorts, or a shirt pocket.For instance, a certain portion of my plastic (like my driver's license and my credit cards) go into a little RFID-blocking metal box (like one shown here). I often place my bills in a money clip, but then I have a small dilemma: what do I do with the rest of my cards and info...the grocery and other store cards, my library card--in all, my other five or six cards. Where do I put them?Well, I love this new organizer. It gives me the ability to gather up all those ""extras"" that sit around in a wallet and firmly encases them in a secure, single location. And what's better is it has that neat little center ""pocket"" that can be used in so many ways. Because this pocket's sealed at the bottom it makes for a really secure spot in which to place bills, important notes, a key or two, even things like coins and so on. The leather is nice and give the organizer a nice feel and look.The organizer seems to be well made: it is stitched well along the edges without any loose threads or other indicators of sloppiness. The stitching goes almost right to the very end of the leather, too, giving you the most inward area they can. And at its thinnest point (when empty) it measures only 2mm thick. To give you an idea how thin this measurement is, it's only HALF the height of the numbers running across most credit cards. THAT's thin, and though the holder when loaded is nowhere near THAT thin, it's why it's no bother to carry it in your front pocket.And a nice feature of its design is that the organizer GAINS strength when cards are added to it. The variety I have has three horizontal slots on each side. (They make two; one has a plastic window for displaying an ID.) Since you can tuck 2 in each slot, my variety can hold 12 cards total. I try to keep it down to one card in each slot to avoid Costanz-ising.All in all, an excellent little card-money-room key holder; I'm using mine daily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JL6N1VMEVY3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0104IXQ0I#wasThisHelpful","R3JL6N1VMEVY3F","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a great time with these boards  since the only way to really test them was to put them through their culinary paces, I asked my wife and daughter if they would mind coming up with tasks for using them. (And I even came up with one!) Needless to say, I had a great weekend.We found the boards to be really nice to use in the kitchen bamboo is by its very nature deceptively light, making them slim and really nice to use.  If you pick up one of these boards, try to imagine it being made of cherry, or maple, or any of those other typically dark woods. Heck, even oak  think of how heavy any of those boards would be in place of this thin, light board.However, despite their seemingly delicate nature, theyre extremely strong and durable.  Again, their slim appearance might fool people who think these are not as stong as their thicker counterparts. It simply comes down to the fact that since theyre made of a really strong wood they dont have to be thick to stand up to the rigors of chopping and whatnot. Additionally, they are extremely easy to clean.And the same goes for storing them: because of their slimness they take almost no space in the cupboardthat is, if you want to store them inside a cabinet. Take a good look at them: theyre extremely attractive, and their featherweight nature AND good looks (and handles!) make them many homemakers choice of display-worthy products.Their handles make them easy to store and even display, and why not? Bamboo is a light colored, attractive wood, and is extremely sanitary. Ecologically,  bamboo is an extremely renewable resource: its considered a plant, not a tree, and one of its best traits for industry is that it grows to its fully marketable height of 15 to 40 feet in about 3 to 7 years dependant on its speciescompare that to any tree.I know Im going beyond the simple testing of a product, but I like bamboo, and believe it makes great sense as a resource.Ill give you one detraction: my wife and daughter BOTH mentioned that they would have liked to have a groove on the chopping boards in order to channel away the juices that one often encounters when cutting up moist products  like, say, tomatoes, watermelon, or a sizzling steak. A channel would help direct it away from the rest of the counter, especially the portion that would lead the juices OFF the counter onto the one doing the slicing and, in particular, their clothes (and the floor).Despite this one minor fault, we found this to be a great product...one we would buy with no hesitation.NOTE: I was given a free sample of this product with no stipulation other than I provide an honest review...which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R122JSBYM64YJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WCAPEJ8#wasThisHelpful","R122JSBYM64YJX","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Did you ever look at a product that is so simple and solid in its delivery of a certain commodity to the general public that makes so much sense that you slap yourself in the middle of your forehead with the butt of your hand and yell, ""WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?""Well, guess what? This is that product for me. My daughter has her own veterinary clinic and my wife is the office manager there, and they are constantly day in/day out keeping records for clients (there are still a lot of things that computers can't do yet.). This kind of work keeps them very busy, and they need quick ways to write down facts or notes or thoughts, many of which are permanent, and many that will soon be erased.So, wouldn't it be nice if there were some way to write down visit information and then erase it? Gee, I wonder how one might accomplish that?Well, credit HD Chalks for figuring out this crazy-good and simple solution. You write down the information, knowing that it will probably have to do with one person or animal or visit only (though it could be longer). The blackboard is a perfect white-on-black message system, and it's erasable yet can last for a long time if one does not erase it.We did not experience the problem some reviewers had when it came to peeling the labels off the backing paper -- I assume I got the problem right. I know some people mentioned they were having trouble with repeated peelings of the labels off of things like bottles, but we do not use the labels in this manner this way and therefore cannot comment on them. As to how we used them:We labelled the plastic file holder one often sees outside a patient's room...the one the doctor reaches into before actually stepping foot into the patient room. For this, the chalk was perfect: we wrote down the patients' name(s) on it and any other pertinent short info, and then erased it when a new patient used it.On folders, we write  info for THIS VISIT ONLY: things like names and addresses were not best served by using chalk, as you might guess. Where chalk was perfect had to do with this particular visit, and here the chalk was perfect. We also have some plastic bins which change in purpose every so often, so these labels were great. Also, there were some other things which really need to be updated, and those again are perfect. We did NOT take the labels off at any point...once they were peeled from the backing paper and applied where they had to be placed, they stayed there.Anyway, these were PERFECT! We loved them, and writing on them was a lot of fun. The unique quality of the ""chalkboard"" format did not wear thin on those who used them, and it is fun to write and erase on the folders and other labels. but the system did not prosper simply because of that...no, it made sense, and is simply a really smart system.So...FIVE STARS. I almost took off a point because I didn't think of this first, but I was persuaded that such an idea may not have been very ""fair."" So, five stars it is.NOTE: I was given a free sample of this product with no stipulation other than I provide an honest review...which this is","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QN1OCWA3ZUNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBOANAE#wasThisHelpful","R1QN1OCWA3ZUNY","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the things I really liked about this drawer organizer is its versatility...if it doesn't fit a drawer space, hang it on a wall. If you want to make it smaller, that's fine. Larger, that's fine, too. Want more organizing slots? Put in the extra dividers. Get tire of that? Take them out. You can make a lot of adjustments with this product.First off, this is a really substantial draw organizerto start off, consider its dimensions:Smallest size: 12.9 x 17 x 1.7Largest size: 19.3 x 17 x 1.7All in all, this is pretty accommodating; my kitchen drawers are about 20 x 22, so theyll certainly work at any size I want. I like the freedom that gives me.Next, bamboo is an excellent choice of wood to use when it came to the creation of this shelf. Its a good solid wood that is still significantly lighter than a lot of woods that are comparable in strength. If one holds up the organizer/shelf in his or her hands it is really pretty easy to imagine the heaviness of other woods that could have been used: oak, say, or maple or cherry, etc. They would have been a lot heavier.Im really pleased with the upsurge in using bamboo lately: its getting to be a relatively common wood one can find in the southern U.S. from eastern Texas to Virginia, and its growing in popularity for projects such as these. (Its considered a plant, not a tree, and one of its best traits for industry is that it grows to its fully marketable height of 15 to 40 feet in about 3 to 7 yearscompare that to any tree.) Its nice to see it being used in business ventures like this.Anyway, I also really like the idea of the unit dividersthe company includes four dividers for the more common narrower slots, and one divider for the two remaining bigger slots. They are sized exactly alike (the four, that is) and all have been sanded and well-prepped. The same with the slots where they goI see NO poorly sanded slots, or chips, or splinters, etc.I really like that the drawers are extendable along a rather substantial track along the two short sides of the unit. This really makes it much more possible to safely consider it as a  shelf unit, as the drawers are less likely to simply drop off or go haywire. I know whereof I speak, in that I have a plastic set that does not use this same system, and I would no more use it on the wall as a shelf than I would one with rubber bands. The Home-Complete system is considerably more solid in its design and execution.I also like the diversification allowable with these: as drawer units they are usable in silverware; utensils; in the bathroom they can organize womens cosmetics and brushes, etc.; or in a workplace it can divide smaller tools or items like nails, nuts and bolts; in electronics: in arts and crafts; or in the bedroom, where they could organize jewelry, or other items; they could gather and divide collections (coins, stamps, or other collectibles); or various miscellaneous items like coupons; hobbies; or what have you.As shelf units the sky is the limitscrewed to the wall they could be used in the kitchen, in bedrooms, in the garage, a workroom, a rec room (say, cassette tapes or games, dice, etc.); or simply for  decorative purposessay, posing small figurines or any sort of collectibles, or even sentimental items. When I received mine my wife immediately relegated it to my use, giving it hardly a glance she intimated it would not be attractive enough for her.  Yet after I placed on the wall of my workroom to post not only bottled items like nails and screws and nuts and bolts, etc, and when she paid a relatively rare trip to my workroom she uttered a little sigh, declaring she had not been given a substantial enough look at it. She would certainly have liked to use it for items in our bedroom. (I have a feeling Ill be ordering more organizers in the very near future.)Two things I wish the people making this set of drawers had done:1. Make the two sliding drawer arms be able to accommodate an adjustable drawer dividerthis would have not only given us the ability to divide the drawers (17 is a LONG drawer on each side), but it would have also stabilized the extended drawer. Sure, when it lies in a horizontal drawer its pretty stable by itself, but this isnt the only way the drawer is meant to be used: should it be vertical as, say, a spice rack, it would be nice to have a way to break up these longer shelves, which of course theyd be called that in this position.2. Im sure this idea would involve something pretty substantial, building-wise, but wouldnt it be nice if one were able to double the extension of the one drawer instead of using both drawers? That would truly allow for some larger items to be placed within it if it were a drawer OR a shelf. Its just a thought  not a negative. I truly think it would involve some real upper-level thinking, and probably would be nowhere as easy to actually accomplish as it is to suggest it. Its just a thought.Incidentally, I read a couple of 1-  to 2-star reviews (at the time of my posting there were only four each) that addressed a kind of chintzy, cheap quality to their drawers poor sanding here and there, nail pops, splinters, etc. I honestly do not see where they got their drawer units; that is, how theirs could be so cheap, whereas mine (and apparently so many others) got theirs at such high quality. I dont doubt what they say, not am I saying anything like theyre being too harsh. I absolutely believe themits just intriguing; mine is a very nice, well-made, pleasant product. Im thoroughly puzzled.NOTE: I was given a free sample of this product with no stipulation other than I provide an honest review...which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX52UD1PQICH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WCB5CIU#wasThisHelpful","RX52UD1PQICH5","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this wallet case by Mengo. Ive had only two lesser problems to address with it, and I would like to make the point (as have many other Amazon reviewers) that had Amazon a ten-point system, instead of 5, as this would be a great case for a nine out of ten. I think that this is an excellent wallet overall, and Im going to keep on using this LONG after Im done testing it. I think that says a lot about its worth.Positives:1. Though it might not be the wallets most important point, the Mengo is really a nice-looking wallet. Its sleek snakeskin (black, in this case) is certainly striking, and I am continually struck by its appearance every time I pick it up. I feel good when I look at it and, by extension, I feel good when its seen by others. And its important to state here that most of its life is spent on a farm, where mud, dust, and pooh reign supreme. If the Mengo wallet case can look good here, it will look good in most situations. Other than a small tear (whose effect Ive minimized by simply coloring the torn spot with black ink) I feel the snakeskin looks really snazzy.2. The Mengo does a great job protecting the phone. It encompasses it and holds it (maybe even a bit too tightly  see Negatives, Point 2, below) and I have confidence in my phone being protected should it fall from my handseven a fall of several feet to the ground. While I love screen protectors, I always make the point that all they do is protect the front. The sides and front edges (and therefore, the screen as well) are vulnerable from certain angles if no further protection is offered. Wallets, such as this model, does offer those protections. I dont know that it would survive EXTREME falls, but for this price, thats asking a bit much of it.3. The Mengo case also allows good access to almost all of its functional areas (with the exception of the power switch, as described in #2,below): camera, headphone jack, micro USB, speakers, etc.4.  This is an extremely light wallet as well. Its so light, in fact, that there have been several times I was convinced I had forgotten to pack it in my bag, or forgot it was in my pocket. As I often carry several other things at the same time, its slight weight is a really great positive point, especially when I have just detailed how strong and protective it is. Having both is ideal.5. The interior wallet slots are nice, but I dont try to use this very muchIve found that  the hard plastic cards that I place within them tend to scratch whatever screen protector I have (and they make a great case for why screen protectors are important).  I do particularly like the transparent slot, however, and its a great place for my drivers license. Im never without my phone, and therefore I always have my ID with me. And, situated as it is, this ID never scratches my phone. Id really like it if they used the upper part for another window, as I could put another card (such as my medical insurance card) in there. Realize too that you have the long slot under the whole ID area for bills, though it will not fit dollars without bending them in some waythats also a little bit inconvenient, but overall nice.6. I like the clasp that binds the wallet closedits called Magna-Clasp Technology and I guess that simply means it has a small magnet inside its outward-most tip. I wonder, however, if it was wise having a magnet so close to a place where other people place credit cards and other plastic with magnetic info strips. I wonder if this might be dangerous.Negatives:1. As I mentioned above, the wallet has torn a bit in the area behind the phone, but it is visible only when the phone is being formed into a horizontal stand-up position.  Plus, I easily remedied the physical problem. Yet it could be a problem if it continuesIll update this posting if it does.2. The phone does such a great job of encompassing the phone that it makes it pretty difficult to use the power switch (located just above the Magna-Clasp Technology flap). It is in fact very difficult to hit the switch effectively  say, in order to turn off the power when Im no longer using it and need to reserve power. When I do touch it the plastic rim can make it really difficult to actually PUSH the switch.  Between the act of trying to locate it and then actually getting the switch to work, the process (which used to take a second or so) can often now take me about 5 to 15 (or even more) frustrating seconds if Im not careful. One problem that can result from that is that it can really waste power if I assume it to be off when it is not. Or it can create an embarrassing situation in a movie theater. But my solution is simply to be aware, and look.To close, my feeling about whether I marked it down to a 4 out of 5 came down to this: do the problems Ive addressed interfere in a regular or really important way? As Ive said, I didnt think that the tear was a big problem, but the power switch issue can be a regular one if Im not careful. It does interfere with my daily use of the phone, though in a (mostly) minor way, a problem that I can circumvent by simply looking. I thought that was not worth taking it down a point.  So much was good about this wallet that I thought it was worth overlooking the couple of problems I encountered.Like I said, however, were Amazon ever to go to a ten-point system, I would definitely have made this a 9taking off a point out of 5 just didnt seem fair.NOTE: I was given a free sample of this product with no stipulation other than I provide an honest review...which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SAXBTC46GCL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010C8HT5I#wasThisHelpful","R3SAXBTC46GCL8","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Since there are no wires, all you need is a smooth spot to place itit takes just 4. Inside the house, the door chimes come with their own little stand and therefore it can be placed anywhereanywhere, that is, within 300 feet of the site of the button outside the door.  If your house is larger than that well, suffer.You get 16 choices for chimes, as well. Theyre all part of a very easy-to-understand and comprehensive set of directions. Like, say, your choices of cellphone ringtones, there will be some youll like, some youll love, some youll think are almosts, and some youll have a good laugh at. They offer a good range of volume, and  youll even get the option of using the doorbell tone only, using the tone AND a flashing light, or using ONLY the flashing light. I think most people will be pleased with the selection offered, but my only recommendation here would be that  as we are now in the days of computer genius, it would have been nice to have come up with a way for some additional ones to be addedin the manner, say, that cellphones can add ringtones. (Its a thought, perhaps, for the boys and girls in Product Development to tinker with in the future...)All in all, Famili has created a very easy-to-use doorbell system that has a great range and is well thought out from the installation phase to its final operation. If youre looking for a replacement door chime  that requires NO wires to set up, one that has as a variety of chimes as well as a range of volume AND distance from the ringer itself  well, then, this is a door chime for you.NOTE: I NOTE: I was given a free sample of this product with no stipulation other than I provide an honest review...which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21B8YBW2XAOUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011AWM4A0#wasThisHelpful","R21B8YBW2XAOUQ","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an device that provides an extraordinary amount of help when it comes to working with products that A) require illumination, and B) require both of your hands and/or concentration. So much falls under these conditions that youll eventually wonder how you ever got by without them.I border on being a physical wreck, so I dont jog or anything, but I walk at night from my barn. I use tools, too, and I read at night, and I have to find things Ive dropped... in these activities, too, this headlamp is a huge help. In fact, I figure it will help out when I (or anyone else) work on a car, tend a pets night wounds, read a map, tend to ANYTHING when if my power goes out, and temporarily blind ones daughters (all right  that last one isnt recommended, but a father can find some habits to be hard to drop.)Face it: there are all sorts of reasons the headlamp is a tool that is as beneficial as the magnetic nail holder. And as for this one, there are several features that I found to be really helpful.THE BAND: Made of a stretchable elastic, the band doesnt really need an exact fitits very easy to adjust and the material is pretty slippery smooth. The importance of that is that the fabric did not seem prone to grab hair or get caught in things a more textured fabric might.THE LIGHT(S): The two white lights are beyond bright (ask my daughters). Pressed once, the white lights alternate between the two side bulbs and the single center bulb. Pressed three times in quick succession, the white lights strobeon/off/on/off and so on. Press it once a sustained second or so, and you have a red light. Once you get used to the light and its functions youll find that each of the beams has a low, medium, and high intensity, but heres a neat little thing I found:One bulb trick I discovered can be accessed when any one of the steady lamp beams is on, be it red or white. Holding the button down on a continual basis, the beam will seem unaffected at first until a second or so goes by and then it begins to fade. As long as you maintain pressure, the beam will fade until it is out completelyyet taking your finger off before it fades completely traps that beam at how low its intensity was when you let go. (Tapping the button again will turn the light off and return the light to its normal functions.)Additionally, this light puts its metaphorical money where its metaphorical mouth is: it boasts not only 100 % water resistance, but it comes with a lifetime warranty. THATs a sturdy light that guarantees its durability.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WUL7HRMA31NX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSQEVQW#wasThisHelpful","R2WUL7HRMA31NX","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an extremely ambitious work for a young writer, and both of those statements contain important implications.As to the first half of that opening clause, ALGORITHM is not content simply to go to the furthest reaches of the world to tell his tale  no, it goes to the very edge of the galaxy, to the very heart of who we are, to the very reason we existindeed, to our very Maker. Its a pretty stunning achievement.What should be given prominence is that there is an interesting authenticity within this book. The author  in his real other life as a scientist  shares a prestigious award for discovering a new anti-cancer drug... a great achievement on its own. But even if that werent enough to convince us that he probably knows his way around the lab, there is enough hard science in this book to make such concepts as DNA research have an authentic ring AND still manage to be understandable, something thats not as easy as it sounds.One extremely interesting bit of science at the heart of this novel  that an object made of gold was discovered in a chunk of charcoal and must therefore be at least a hundred thousand years old and far older than we have ever believed civilization to be  is not even conjecture. No: this discovery actually happened in the late 1800s! There is more in the way of actual history in this book as well, notably a mine disaster in 1959 Pennsylvania, that provides the story with fascinating authenticity.But there is much here that comes out of the authors imagination, and though descriptions of the mine and its grounds seemed authentic, what he did with creating suspense in the many and varied action scenes was handled well. The novel is built on continuous the notion of providing action, action, and more action, and reads quickly. I had no problem poring through it and returning to it once other circumstances permitted. The author is able to create a plausible story at the same time he provides cliffhanger after cliffhanger.What I found most interesting about ALGORITHM is that author Doweyko really could have stopped halfway through this novel and still had a great book. In fact, there is so much in this story that seems to conclude, in a sense, halfway through the novel that as we neared the middle I found myself wondering, Theres no way hes going to take this to THAT stage now, is he? After all, the novels already had scientific shockers and a kidnapping and shootings and an evil business tycoon and explosions and a seeming re-animation of a dead man and  oh, yes  an alien visitortheres no way hes really going to travel to the stars for an even bigger conclusion? Hasnt he accomplished more than enough already?Well, the answer is that you may as well buckle your safety harness; the rides not over.  And in the second part of this novel things get REALLY interesting, but Ill leave thatto say much about the second half of a book is really dangerous when it comes to spoilers  though I will do a little of it toward the end of my review. Dont worry: I WILL warn you beforehand.Since the novel is his first, it bears stating here that I also thought the mechanics here were by and large very good. There were a few mechanical faults  spelling error here, a comma or apostrophe there  but for the most part they were few and far between and never detracted from the story.There is occasional prosaic writing as well, like this line: It was almost as if the melancholy sounds were calling out to them from another time, drawing them nearer like sirens to rocky shoals. Heres another concerning the tiredness felt by the two main characters: Morpheus soon embraced the duo in his comforting arms. I wondered, however, if having writing this eloquent occur here and there within a story, every twenty or so pages, might not seem a little out of placeI leave it for better minds than mine.On to some other problems, which I want to emphasize are more minor in nature. One that did bother me concerned the practice of sudden switching of narrative which I admit is quite popular in fiction nowadays: its where the story is following one track, and then suddenly the author switches us and makes us follow another. If handled well, such a technique builds suspense; and if the author can make the reader excited about both (or more) storylines, well, that reader becomes truly hooked.Here, though, such switches are sometimes handled in a too abrupt, even bizarre fashion. For instance, theres a moment when the main track of the action is following an interesting dialogue between Adam and Linda, our two main scientists who are possibly making a game-changing diagnosis in the understanding of DNA. Suddenly, the narrative jumps  in the concluding paragraph of the chapter  to this:The cylinder turned and a large engine at one end fired in a programmed series of short bursts to begin a controlled process of deceleration. The G-forces needed to be carefully regulated. Excessive forces would not damage the cocooned occupants, but could pose issues to the few awake and on duty.While such a NOTION is correct, this single paragraph in the midst of an otherwise smooth narrative is too jarring a departure and simply doesnt work. Granted, while hints of a new alien narrative angle should be exciting, this is too suddenly thrown in and discarded, like a misplaced sequence of film frames tacked in by a forgetful film editor.While there were some really minor things that irked me, like how the author kept hinting about the gradual awakening of attraction between Adam and Linda that too often relied on their eyes meeting precipitously  over and over again. But one moment that really bothered me was the really, well, just STRANGE, instance occurring at a point when Adam is off trying to discover more of the spacecrafts hidden secrets. The author gives us this comparison: It was like he was back in grammar school, trying to avoid getting caught in the schools attic where he had been searching out bottles containing dead babies. He never did find any, but remained convinced they had to be there somewhere. I dont know about you, but to me thats a pretty horrendous and contrived flashback, imagined or otherwise, to simply throw in for what I believe to be largely comic effect. Yes, a metaphorical point might be made about the ultimate direction the narrative will take late in the book, but I still think this is just too unnatural and shocking to be thrown in and then just dropped.Still, there are so many positives about this book that outweigh these relatively minor slipups. The book is continuously imaginative and even daring at times. As mentioned earlier I felt it was to Doweykos credit he did not take the easy road and conclude his novel before it really did travel to the very bounds of our galaxy. I only wished at the end  as a reviewer more than a reader  that the author had gone for the spike once hed scored his touchdown.That is (AND THIS COULD BE A SPOILER, SO BE AWARE!), I wish hed really made something more out of the Maker concept. personally thought he missed something when he made no real concrete play on the allusion (see note below). After all, his central character is named Adam. Some more work on this concept, the cleverer the better, would have really set the work apart. I am not attempting to force the authors hand in any way, nor am I telling him a direction he should have gone with it. If he wants to be heretical, fine; if he wants to be reverent, thats fine, too. I just think that he had set his table and had dinner hot and waiting on the tableI only wish that we could have taken a bite.NOTE: I spoke to the author about this, and he said that he HAD considered this as a concept -- and considered that this particular trope overdone. I can't really argue with that, and I'm glad to take my include this notation for the readers' (and his) benefit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RQ6529SS0R4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989401197#wasThisHelpful","R1RQ6529SS0R4N","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was taken aback when I first de-boxed the Dechunxian Bottle-Cup, which is just as much a Bottle-Cup as it a Container-Jar and a little bit Thermos (which is a brand name AND a popular noun). Its got a striking appearance, and though I usually reserve this adjective for puppies or daughters: this is downright CUTE. I think its safe to say that if you take this bottle-cup-container-jar to work, youre going to get positive feedback.As to its features, I like the wide open mouthit makes drinking from it a very easy and pleasing experiencethis is no soda or water bottle with a tiny aperture. And, while it doesnt have interior threads for a screw-top enclosure, I think its safe to say that if you firmly situate the top down inside the mouth, that lid is going to stay closed  even if you store it on its side. There is a nicely ribbed plastic sleeve round the lid that really grabs and holds it in place.And speaking of that insulating cloth sleeve, I like that it fits snugly around the container without being at all difficult to slide the bottle-cup-container-jar withintheres no struggle at all. And it wont come off easily IF you slide the plastic clip on the top string nice and tight: it provides a great fit thats just as easily tightened as loosened.This brings up another aspect: though it comes with a very pleasant insulating sleeve, I would not necessarily think of it as something that would hold heatyoure not going to throw in a cup of hot soup and expect it to stay warm til you chow down at noon. However, it is easily microwaveable and then that insulating sleeve comes in really handy: its going to make it easy to hold a somewhat hot or cold liquid with relative comfort. As to storing a cold liquid, Id use sensible caution about packing ice cubes within it: this is glass, after all. That Dechunxian offers a three-month warranty speaks to that prudence.On the positive side, glass is SUCH a pleasant thing to drink from. I think most people will agree that glass is a LOT more satisfying container than plastic. It provides a much better taste experience and doesnt carry the smell many say plastic has.As to its size, 400 ml is about 7/8 of a pint. Its not huge; it wont provide you a gargantuan drink at the end of a workout, but it is a very good size for, say, a glass of tea or even NON-liquid treats, like nuts or granola or many other items.Which leaves us with one final point: what word will ultimately define this, um, bottle-cup-container-jar? I think boccujar is a little unwieldy, while other words like vessel or pot or jug dont quite cut it. How about ewer? (Its certainly no more unwieldy than Dechunxian.)I leave it to you to decide.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M6L9W5KIK0JW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V061L9M#wasThisHelpful","R1M6L9W5KIK0JW","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are trying to use your laptop (or desktop) computer to make a multi-media presentation or play back video, this device adds an extra VGA port to your computer in a simple and efficient manner.Unfortunately I am no computer genius. This adaptor sat on my desk for quite a while before I had any real idea of what to do with it. Finally, knowing I had yet to do this review, I finally found a more savvy friend (though no computer genius) and he helped me. Here I must confess I didnt understand a lot of what he told me  in great part due to the fact that it seemed he was speaking a different language.I must admit I am at a complete loss when it comes to discussing such things as data flow and video cards and bandwidth. I feel like I am incapable of understanding anything in this realm.I know that he plugged the USB connector to my laptop and then installed the driver by using the disc provided. I also know that it didnt work the first time, and he made adjustmentsthough not extensive ones. And I know that after the initial installation-- as well as after the second adjustment -- he had to restart the computer (which the directions tell you to do), and let the computer run through its new adaptation. The second time around it was connected.Once the device was connected I thought that the images on the screen had good clarity and fine color display. I did not have any of the image problems some of the respondents mentioned such as jumping pixels, but there was a little bit of what one or two writers called lag time  in other words, a little pause right after giving the command. As this is primarily used for adding additional monitors to ones device, this should not be a huge disappointment.On top of his triumphant feelings concerning connection, my friend said that he thought that this was a good price for an adapter such as this. When I informed him that the product information displayed on the product page says it will handle up to six monitors, he believed it could be true, though it would require six adapters to do so. (I will leave it to wiser souls than mine to determine just how to do that.)It seems worth noting, finally, that LinkS provides a one-year warranty.Ultimately, I'm giving this a five star review because -- though I am not a great judge of technical issues -- it seems that this does what it sets out to do.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KSH1C9DSSR5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYZE3VK#wasThisHelpful","R1KSH1C9DSSR5E","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice water bottle, as long as you realize its purpose is NOT to keep drinks cold. (By the way, though, it does that decently well.)I saw a ""How It's Made"" on bottles like this...It starts from a single pellet, flattened, and then extruded and pressed into a tubular form. One piece...no seams. It's pretty amazing.So what you don't get are any messy problems one typically gets with other kinds of bottles. No glass inside or out, no seams, no bending, melting, or fracturing the container. No leeching of chemicals into the liquid, no parts to keep track of other than the top, no taste from the plastic or any other compound surrounding the drink liquid.Just two parts: an impeccably clean stainless steel container and a plastic top.So, while it doesn't work like a true Thermos, it does a great job of working like a very good liquid container should: it keeps liquids safe and apart from any exposure to the elements; it is easy to handle and slim and could even be called ""sleek."" It is extremely clean and able to take a pretty substantial impact and remain not only undamaged but is also able to keep the liquid inside untainted.The container's shape is extremely beneficial to the task: it's easy to place within things like knapsacks and other carrying cases...right down to (larger) briefcases. It is very slim, and can be carried within the palm easily. The handle, if you will, is the top, which when screwed in securely becomes tote-able through its oval plastic loop. It would be easy to attach to a bicycle frame, as it is very aerodynamic. It is in effect a negligible thing when it comes to taking up space.And, perhaps most importantly, being of clean, stainless steel -- without solder or glue or any other material but the steel itself -- it does NOT impart any taste whatsoever to the liquid within. It is as clean a drink of water as you'll get: certainly as clean and clear as the water one places within it. If I may be permitted, there is something so ""right"" about steel as stainless steel as a container for water: it tastes pure and clear when imbibed, and thoroughly unblemished by the container that held it, which I feel is not true about certain plastics. It is like glass as a container, though there are of course no end of risks when water is transported within glass.Overall, this is a terrific container: hardy, strong, and clean. It almost will NOT break, and will not mar the quality of that which is within it.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34QG3VGOOB8DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PKV2SHW#wasThisHelpful","R34QG3VGOOB8DG","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice case that does a very good job at its initial and stated task: protecting the phone it encases. There is more to it, however, both positive (and a couple of negative points, too).First: as written, it does a good job of protecting the Galaxy S5 from collisions or strikes around the edges or back, as well as a fall upon the ground that does not strike within the screen. For instance, it would do a great job of protecting a phone that fell off a table and tumbled to the ground (or out of a pocket or even out of a moving car's window). It accomplishes this commendable feat though a combination of a hard exterior and a soft inner rubber liner. The former TAKES the hit, and the latter DISTRIBUTES the hit throughout the larger area. Together they effectively render almost all side, rear, or full-on, direct hits insufficient to do harm.In such a manner, the Mengo Stealth Armor Shockproof case does a great job of protecting its contents. It also looks nice, and adds to the appearance of the phone.As stated, the phone also comes with a stand, or ""tripod,"" if you will. When one pulls out the little bar in the back it does indeed permit the phone to stand by itself -- though I found it more effective in the horizontal position. It tends to wobble when it's standing more vertically...at least in my experience.I found that when my Galaxy S5 was in this case and, say, in my pocket, or in my carrying pack, I felt assured that my phone was safe. I did not worry about bumping into something or placing my pack somewhere where its placement might otherwise threaten my phone's ""health."" Wearing the Mengo protective case, the phone was safe. It's a comforting feeling.Yet it has a couple of faults.First, while it can take a straight-on hit from all sorts of directions, it does NOT protect its screen from any kind of a strike that misses the edges and directly to its interior face. If such a hit occurs, and it's substantial -- like, say, hitting a rock or the corner of a chair or table or any of a variety of small edges. A good hit by something with an edge and contains some force to it could really hurt the glass face of the phone. But around its edges, or back, it's terrific.The other fault is that the rubber casing -- in particular, the on/off button and the volume button on either upper side --  is restrictive, and makes the pressing of those buttons difficult at best, and almost impossible at its worst. There were times I had to press, press again, and re-press that button again, hard before it would allow that button to work. While it is good that the rubber encasement is substantial in all other cases, allowing it to cover these buttons really hurts their ease of use and functionality. I might think it best to actually cut this portion OUT of the case if one finds this to be as difficult as I did.Other than those two factors, I found this to be a splendid protective case. There are a variety of collisions that could harm the phone that this case renders null ... and it looks good, too.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OKMGL131H7YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNQNKW6#wasThisHelpful","R3OKMGL131H7YI","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rebecca McCrays THE JOURNEY OF THE MARKED is a clever and fun YA story that occasionally stumbles over itself due to a complex list of characters and a jumpy narrative form. Regardless, it still manages to be appealing and even compelling at times.In fact, THE JOURNEY OF THE MARKED involves us because for the very same reason that sometimes makes it confusing: this is a very large story not only due to the size of the cast, but also because of their unique and diverse characteristics. The world of Zolei, we find, is a planet that seems to attract unusual groups of people. As the narrator informs us, Zolei is a refuge for persecuted species. Though the Miyran race inhabited the land first, the Tyrnotts have come along and forcibly grasped power from them, barely hiding their brutal nature. To garner help, the leader of the Miyrans, Lady Anyamae, has mysteriously placed striking marks behind the left ear of select citizens on their 16th birthdays, identifying them as future warriors for the cause.  Unfortunately, doing so also made them targets of the Tyrnotts roving military thugs, the Graelithshuge beasts who seem to be made for hunting and hurting others.And these are only a few of the races that inhabit Zolei  there are over a dozen more, each populated by unique characters. Some walk, some fly, and some even change from one form to another. Some get along with one another, and others become murderous when nearby certain others. And its getting worse: while those who inhabit its forests and cities have co-existed up until now, it is not a cohesive civilization, and the clock is tickingwhen a youth dies violently, her funeral attracts thousands of sympathizers, and the formerly peaceable peoples of the land are fed up with the status quo.To further complicate the narrative, the storylines zig-zag between chapters  that is, one set of characters and circumstances occurs in every, say, third chapter, and then two other storylines do the same. So it's easy to be confused when reading the story  it can be a  pretty puzzling potpourri of people, places, and plot.So: what to do? Well, I came up with an answer, and here goes:Go to Amazon and bring up the PAPERBACK version of JOURNEY OF THE MARKED.  Look for the little Search Inside This Book bar and type the phrase Glossary of Species. From here on in its simple: just leave that page up and refer to it as you read the book. Its going to take you a few chapters to get it all sorted out, but this will help enormously. Whenever you have a question, just pup over to that section and work it out.Once the characters begin to distinguish themselves in your mind, the going gets much easier. And thats when THE JOURNEY OF THE MARKED gets interesting. While we understand what motivates Tip, a Liput, to find whether his older brother Sri survived beyond the hour or so his oldest brother took to die; one can only wonder what it is that drives the very physical and competent Arlian teen named Kenrya to push others away. And we can certainly sympathize with the plight of Human boy named Eros, grown to young manhood without a father, and still wonders whether he will ever actually discover his own.And those are only a few of the stories.TJotM is a great tale for young adults, and while once again I think some may be put off by the large cast and complex narrative, I think they will be happy to put forth the effort. After all, every bit of the story is accessible; McCrays writing style is easy to follow and her vocabulary and her sentence/paragraph construction are extremely reader friendly. All in all, there is more than enough here to make a go of a long series, one that readers would be eager to follow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ313O0XRX76N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1495336174#wasThisHelpful","RZ313O0XRX76N","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am in love...This glass protector for my Samsung Galaxy S5 is a beautiful thing: it was extremely easy to install and it looks WONDERFUL! I cannot tell you how pure it looks other than to say it appears there's nothing there at all...with this exception: NOTHING now mars the images on my Samsung Galaxy screen.When it was time for me to pick out a new phone I picked the S5 because the bare screen has a beautiful visual display that is wide, tall, and, unfortunately...RIPE for CRACKING.It's my greatest fear. I'm an older guy and I do all the nutty things older guys do: I carry the phone in my pocket along with things like change and nail clippers, I am always taking it out while I work on little projects that often place it around all sorts of tools, and to top it all off I have shaky hands. You can see why I worry.I did get a protective case for it, and a plastic screen protector - the little wallet shielded it front and back, but even that had its problems: the billfold's slots created little scratches on the soft plastic screen protector. So, while the screen was literally covered and protected, it always looked crummy. Additionally, the plastic protector allowed fingerprints and other impurities to further ""dirty up"" the screen.When I received the Bluboon protector for testing I worried about putting it on: like most people I usually had problems placing the plastic kind of protectors with any degree of proficiency: try as I might there were always bubbles in the plastic. But NOT the Bluboon: no worries at all. No dimples or bubbles or any other difficulties. Think: it's a little, tiny, pane of glass! Just peel off the backing, align it, and lay it down on the glass. Press on it to make sure it's on there, and you're done.Now, it's worth saying that, as this IS glass, if there is going to be any damage done here it will suffer like the phone's original glass screen would have were it not protected. So protect it: the best thing is to put it in a case of some kind. But you can at least rest assured that no key ring or nail clipper or seat belt or pen, etc., is going to scratch your screen. Glass is strong - until it shatters, of course. But at least it's your screen protector that will take the brunt of it in all but big hits.But until it all this screen protector is really beautiful. Minor cleaning is all that's needed...I use lint-free cloths or the little Zeiss Pre-Moistened wipes I use to keep my eyeglasses clean. With that tiny amount of care, I still really can't believe how good my screen looks.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31OZE3X7OKEFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTLV54W#wasThisHelpful","R31OZE3X7OKEFZ","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is the great strength of the Bluboon, in fact: its an extremely hardy individual speaker.As to its overall specifics (what a great oxymoron!)The unit paired up well (and very easily) with both my S5 Samsung android phone as well as my Kindle HD Fire tabletthe process took almost no time and succeeded on the first try. It was accomplished within maybe two minutes.In terms of its fidelity, it did a pretty good job of reproducing the crisp acoustic guitar work and dead on harmonies of in 20 Years by the Civil Wars; the complexities of horn and voice of #41 by the Dave Matthews Band; the light, airy harmonies of Feelin Groovy by Simon and Garfunkel; the drop-dead joy of Roundabout by Yes the Bluboon handled all of it capably and did so while free of electronic noise and static.Like I said, its not going to do the job you might find in an expensive automobile sound system, but thinking it should isnt fair. This is a good product that will reproduce sound particularly well IN your shower areaafter all, dont YOU usually sound better in there, too? So, no, youre not going to find the same sound here as you might sitting in a sound chamber blasting a pair of Blaupunkts at you, but you SHOULD expect a fairly good representation of sound without worrying about doing harm to your sound system.As to its waterproofing: though I dont know that Ill ever get over feeling crazy when I splash water at electronic products, but this one passed that test as well. To that end, the Bluboon not only has a vigorously hardy appearance, but it played on every time it either accidentally fell or was purposely dropped: as you might be able to tell from its photo, its covered by a rubber tire exterior that really does provide it a hardy durability.Its full-sized suction cup in back is more than capable of hanging on not only DURING your shower but in the duration of time between them as well. And it will stay in place while you play with its features (e.g.: F-F, Reverse, Pause, etc.) as long as you take reasonable care when you do so. The speakers functions are reasonably easy to use, though if youre a person who doesnt wear your glasses in the shower you might find that the uniformly black and pebbly exterior is hard to read  therefore, its up to your memorizing which buttons you need to touch, say, if someone calls; or if you want to hear something over again. And while you CAN increase the volume from this device, Ive found its infinitely easier to do it on the unit OUTSIDE of the shower.This was about the only weakness I found in the Bluboon: it would be a great benefit if the function buttons were brightly enumerated by symbols, or at least raised lettering, as I had trouble determining how to adjust its features without my glasses on  which is primarily how most of us will be encountering this device in the pool or bathroom. As there is about a second long ""lag"" between pushing a button and having the device carry out the instruction, it does make the process of altering what ever it is you're altering -- be it volume or the track number or answering the phone -- a little worrisome.That said, though, I found the Bluboon to be a more than capable speaker unit. It reproduced sound well and across a wide range of musical and non-musical genres (if I can call answering the phone a ""genre""). While I did find some of its features to be a little difficult to manage in the shower, it more than pleased me when it came to handling my playlist or answering the phone while being splashed and even dropped in the bathroom.NOTE: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UJQOPKLMT70Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYZQXRS#wasThisHelpful","R3UJQOPKLMT70Q","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was an extremely easy to use and easy to set up, and I don't even have an iPhone!While I did try this case ON an iPhone 6, the primary testing was done with my Samsung Galaxy s5, which was a piece of cake to set up through my Bluetooth settings. It took about a minute for the whole setup, and from that point onward it worked extremely well -- and to repeat, I was using it with a non-iPhone product.I was equally impressed with its range. I didn't JUST walk a couple of dozen feet away, but I went around a corner as well, and in between the remote and my NON iPhone were a couple of electronic devices like a cordless phone station and a working microwave, and I still had no problem.I will tell you that there is a very small lapse of time between the pressing of the button and the clicking of the camera, but it was no more than around a second. Knowing that, you can take it into account when shooting a photo.I found it pretty easy to pull out and put into the case, though being plastic there can be a tendency to be a little bit off track when trying to align the product with its housing. Placing the case ON the iPhone made the product more stable -- which of course would be the way one uses such a product, UNLIKE the way I ""normally"" used and tested this product, but even when I put the case ON an iPhone 6 it still occasionally ""wanted"" to go off the plastic alignment groove. But again, knowing this made me just a little more conscious of putting it on correctly, and it worked fine.Incidentally, I received the pink case (as shown) and, while I would not order pink usually, I still was secure enough in my manhood that I can say I found it to be an attractive plastic case, nicely made, and reasonably sturdy. While the pink color is vivid, It does not go overboard, and the case is actually quite streamlined and VERY light...it will not add a thing to the total weight of your phone.[FYI: I would NOT buy this as a protective case (which is NOT how it is being marketed, so I didn't judge it this way -- this point is purely informational). For instance, this doesn't protect the screen at all when and if it falls. But, again, it does not claim it will.]All in all, I really liked this product. While I am NOT a selfie kind of person (I think the fewer shots of me, the better), this does have excellent applications in other ways. For instance, I am a chronic pain sufferer who is over 60, and though I am quite remarkably studly in all other ways, my hands do shake. Therefore, being able to place the camera down and then click the shutter without touching it REALLY helps steady the shot, and I think many would appreciate this advantage. I found this to be the best reason to use this button, to tell the truth.Altogether, I found this to be an excellent product with some definite advantages, and it did everything it claimed it would. Overall, I remain quite impressed.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHKT1LKIF08ME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QCIOCEO#wasThisHelpful","RHKT1LKIF08ME","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First...you should note that each of the windows that offers you different colored case is A:SO offering you a different configuration of that product. AND: in some of those cases, the cable ties are NOT OFFERED. (See the RED one, for example) More on this later in my second-to-last paragraph.Secondly: I ordered and received the blue case, and couldn't be more happy with it. The product is well made, the elastic organizers are well situated and sewn in, the zippers inside and out are in good working order, and I only found two excess threads in the whole kit (which I nail-clipped right out)...no problem.The kit works well, and provides for nice organization of -- in my case -- a collection of similarly sized short cords. Should you want to place longer connectors in your kit, get a different model. Some are created just for that.I am very pleased with the case, and it does just what I hoped: allow me to place a series of connectors in my case for various reasons: cables with USB connectors, or pin connectors, or any number of other ones. I'm able to store different other connector tips in the mesh portion, and that portion zips.The kit also comes with Velco ties that are additionally helpful when it comes to organizing and separating the ties. (See the note below.)NOTE: my kit was missing those ties -- they WERE offered with my kit -- so I considered knocking the kit down a star or two because of that, as I was not sure how lucky or difficult I might find it to go through the process of contacting someone to report the problem, especially because I had not noticed the missing tie until a couple of days later, by which point I had thrown away some of the packing slip/invoice that came with the kit, and this is a ""third-party"" offering sold by Amazon. I tried to figure out how to go through contacting BUBM (or Xqueen, the seller who supports BUBM), but that seemed to be very difficult to do (maybe I didn't understand the process). So, I just went through Amazon and they were TERRIFIC, offering me a MORE than substantial credit for those missing ties. I couldn't have been happier with Amazon's Customer Service, who did a great job.Anyway, I am very happy with this kit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K64KRSK3SQZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P19E7OA#wasThisHelpful","R2K64KRSK3SQZB","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I noticed about this belt after taking it out of the package is it's quality: good stitching, nice fabric: made of cloth, Velcro and (primarily) neoprene, it looks substantially well crafted and should last a long time.This is designed to fill three purposes once for the wearer:1. to help you sweat off weight around your waist;2. to look slimmer around the waist;3. to help support the lower back.This product accomplishes all three of those goals -- and more. In short:The wrap is comfortable, and can be worn by men and women. As it is made of Velcro and is easy to adjust, the wearer might have to find somewhere private to accomplish this.If one wears it for any length of time, it will make the wearer sweat. It is not an obvious thing: no lines of sweat formed on my clothes, and in fact some of the sweat was absorbed by the belt itself. But at no time was my sweating obnoxious or problematic...in that sense the belt was a success for me. But understand this is not a belt that makes sweating the Number One Priority...there are other belts out there that will make you sweat more, but remember those belts will be hard to wear in public, while the Ohuhu should be okay -- you don't have to worry about it ""popping"" open. (But I'd wear it a few times to ""practice"" before I took it to work or somewhere else important.)For the next goal -- that of trimming the wearer's waistline -- this belt has the capacity to accomplish that just fine. As one might expect, the wearer can tighten his or her waist as much as (s)he wants (noting, of course, that the belt itself does add a little to your waistline). I wore the belt and looked in the mirror, AND asked my wife, and we both agreed it did a decent job of trimming. The belt's width is really nice when it comes to the trimming factor: it's a little over 7 inches wide, and that covered a good portion of the area between my belt and my ribs.FYI: I think I'm in the mid-range of needing to trim -- I'm 5 foot 10 and have a 36"" waist. I'm not thin, and I certainly could use a good trimming. But I caution those who have a good deal of paunch below and above the area of the belt...as one might expect, it would look unnatural.As for back support, I think it did a good job for a belt like this...as once more I do not think is its a primary purpose. I think, like before, that this feature does a good job of wrapping the wearer's midsection in a pretty strong fabric, but this does not have any firm leather or plastic to prevent the wearer from hurting him (or her) self. I think the belt's presence, however, makes the wearer aware of his/her back, and the device does restrict the wearer's movements to a good extent. In that sense, I think this does protect the wearer.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DDWFPFQ7P5JT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7JFW7I#wasThisHelpful","R2DDWFPFQ7P5JT","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a sharp-looking bathroom scale. Chrome edged on both sides, its glass base is accented in black along the sides and top, and its readout panel is dark enough that the numbers seem to jump out of the base once the scale is stepped upon.  They're a good size, and are easily readable. Not only are they white upon black, but they are almost an inch and a quarter in height.When one steps upon the scale, at first the numbers bounce above and below your weight until you settle and the final numbers read out the figures...like a local weather forecaster who tells you about what you may not want to hear. (My measurements were calculated in pounds, but they are also available in kilograms for those who wish to adopt the metric system...the transformation is simple.)Additionally, the base is big enough for my size 11s...I did not have any trouble getting on the scale, or with balance, or with the way it distributed my weight. The process was always easy and quite comfortable.That's not a surprise to me: Smart Weigh is a company whose products I have tested several times, and I have always been impressed with the accuracy of their scales. The same goes here. I have been able to test one scale against the other, have received calibration weights to double check those figures, and have even in this case been able to measure my weight on the scale, and then shortly after upon my doctor's scale.Dead on.And most importantly to me, my wife liked the way the scale looked, and thoroughly approved its adoption as our main scale...the old one's going to the yard sale.One additional note: this comes with batteries included: all you have to do is install them.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10AEOK0C6TKRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFRZVQI#wasThisHelpful","R10AEOK0C6TKRJ","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I'm not Holly. I'm not Lula Mae, either. I don't know who I am! I'm like cat here, a couple of no-name slobs."" Holly Golightly (Breakfast at Tiffany's)This wonderful likeness screams Audrey Hepburn, and it's a rather stylish one, indeed:  the headpiece, the necklace, the whiskers...All right, there is some artistic license at work here, but I must tell you that I am sold on this pillow. When I was offered a chance to review it I agreed quickly as a kind of camp-y fun: I so often really try to do a good job with these reviews, and I do as much as I can to be serious about the task at hand. But this? It jst looked like a little bit of fun, and then I'd give the pillow to a relative, friend, or yard sale.But upon opening the mail I found myself to be immediately impressed: this is actually a very pretty and well made pillowcase. Yes, it's a cat with the likeness of Audrey Hepburn -- but what a nice likeness it is! The purple really springs out at you, the eyes are plaintive, the expression to die for, and the pillow's construction is actually VERY well carried out.As a result, my wife and I have placed it in the living room, front and center on the living room couch. We have no problem with displaying such a well-made product prominently. And in truth the case (you get the case only, and have to fill it with a pillow of your own) is very hearty: it's a sturdy canvas cloth exterior without being rough or uninviting, and though the pillow I stored within was abysmally near its own death, it gained a second life due to Audrey's kind adoption.The colors are vivid and well detailed: there is no bleeding off of the image across lines or any other defect. I'm very impressed. It's decently sized too: about a foot and a half square.And lest you think all the images are campy or silly, there is a variety being offered online, and you ought to check it out: there are many images I found myself interested in.So all in all I must say I accepted the pillow for its silly, fun image, but I immediately became a convert; this company (Flatworld) puts out a good product.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is...","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EOG0S3E4QITW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R278J3E#wasThisHelpful","R3EOG0S3E4QITW","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is exactly what it appears to be: a well-made organizer that lies flat against the door and allows the user to place within it 12 pairs of shoes. (I don't think there are shoes thin enough that would allow two to be placed within one slot).The organizer comes with the equipment that will easily allow its user to hang it over the door, and the device simply hangs there -- which,of course, is exactly what it's supposed to do. It's made of a sturdy yet breathable material, and it seems well made: the stitching is quite capably done, and the whole apparatus has the feel of something that should last a good while.You know, there is nothing that demands it be used for shoes, either. It does make so much sense, though, that it cover a nice closet door and therefore make use of a space in your closet as yet unused. But it is possible, I suppose, to put all sorts of things in them: hobby and craft equipment; knick-knacky kind of stuff you weren't sure what to make of; belts and other accessories; and so on. But the breathability of the material lends itself to letting your shoes air themselves out (as long, I guess, as you leave your closet door open).

"I'm not a professional photographer, though I was a reporter and photographer for a small daily newspaper in the 1970s -- well before the operation of a camera became digital. but the basics are still the basics, and I can speak to these here.This is a terrific product, and I think it's safe to say it is everything the Ohuhu people say it is. It's easily carried, simple to put together and a great reflector of diffuse light in. For those who aren't familiar, ""diffuse"" refers to spreading the light evenly -- in effect, ""softening"" that light rather than projecting direct, harsh spotlight. This particularly affects two areas: 1) skin tone (as strong light tends to make a pale subject) and 2) shadows, as those tend to lighten and even disappear, including creases on a person's face, for instance, as it's really the shadows that define a crease.Though it's a bit small, this is a great reflector of light and an easy little kit to put together. It just takes a minute to assemble (though a little longer to put it back in its casing, as it's a little tricky). And, for most of your simple shots, where you are shooting head-and-shoulder ""mug shots"" of your subject, this provides enough reflection to do its job well.Let's say, for instance, you're outside, but the situation calls for your subject to have the back of his or her head toward the sun....hence, the face is in shadow. Assemble the kit in about a minute, and your subject is now in a softer, more pleasant light.I think this is an easy kit to throw in the car if you're heading off on a trip, even if it were to be rarely used. It's about the size of a big stack of pancakes, but light as a feather.  There's another model of this Ohuhu product  -- the Ohuhu 5 in 1 Collapsible Studio Lighting Reflector -- that is on a much bigger scale (almost 4 feet in diameter!), and this one is a lot more involved when it comes to its use, but the 9"" product we're talking about here is extremely simple.All in all, I would definitely include this in my camera bag if I were a person who was serious about my photography as a job or hobby.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KPKZRSPY0SUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFOWNTM#wasThisHelpful","R1KPKZRSPY0SUN","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great scale in many ways, and as Ill mention in the succeeding paragraphs I have only a couple of reasons I notched it down one point  and you may find that youll want to add that point back in when it comes to you and your family.There are several features that make this such an attractive scale. As you can see, its mostly clear, and its visible asset is that its design is so cleana curved white plastic bar on top, and two lean stainless steel bars on the side connecting the four circular pads. I just like that its so minimalistic. (I would rather they had not marked up the white bar with the kilogram/pound conversion writing, but this is NOT a big issue, and done is done.)While I like the scale a lot, the only real negative that I encountered is that it does not have a very big platformits a little difficult to climb up on it if you have big feet. There are many people out there with spine problems, like me, and there are therefore many who have a compromised sense of balance. Consequently, its difficult to get on something thats small like this, and I have had more than one occasion where the scale has wobbled under me because I had placed my foot too close to one edge.And if you notice, the upper end of this scale is given at almost 400 pounds. I dont think its a bit unkind to say that persons approaching that weight would likely have a big problem with the small space allottedand the balance issues as well.Other than that, it is a great scale. Given my balance issues, one of the things I like about it the Ohuhu scale is that the weighing process gives you enough time to situate yourself before it locks in. I like that, and so I believe will people balancing busy lives or older people who a beginning to find themselves to be a little unsteady.Whats MOST important, and really should be the only thing that matters, is that it seems to be very accurate as well. It matched up pound-for-pound with another scale I have, and also with my doctors: I weighed myself immediately before leaving for my visit, and their scale was only two ounces off ours. Id call that a winner.As I said, the only fault I found with it is that its platforms a little small, and that was the central reason I gave it four stars. If youre a smaller person, or are very sure on your feet, add that point back in and this becomes a near perfect scale.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN86CK49B8TY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0KZY52#wasThisHelpful","RN86CK49B8TY5","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My middling-starred review is really a reflection of the normal high quality of Smart Weigh's usual products. It's not that this product is of really poor quality; it's not. But it's just that it's rather plain and the packaging is rather weak: I've had the box come open twice, and I've almost lost some of the paper-thin mg weights.In short, my reasons for giving this a middling grade fall into the casing and compartments. First, the plastic lid covers the compartments where I know the little mg weights should go, but I am frightened to put them under it because the lid is made of such a light plastic that, with no latch or clip or Velcro to make sure it stays in place, I am sure I would lose the TINY mg weights. Have you ever ripped paper out of a spiral notebook? You know the little nits of paper that comprise the ripped edge? Well, they're about as big as these milligram weights. (In fact, they might even be an OVER-exaggeration in some cases.) So I think the mini zip-lock plastic bag the seven or so of them come in is the best place for them.There is at least a decently strong latch on the outside of the kit, though I doubt it would withstand a drop from, say, waist high. But the outside latch IS the better latch of them all, and it's nice that it's the one keeping them all in.I can tell that there are a suitable representation of weights from the product description, and I believe that this is a good number of them to enable better calibration. In that respect, this kit seems just fine, and every bit as strong as many others.Anyway, good kit; not so hot display and storage.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLLEHYIB0ZYRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FM7VHUI#wasThisHelpful","RLLEHYIB0ZYRZ","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like this new iPad cover and it has several very positive traits, but there are one or two negatives as well.First of all, the positives: I feel this case offers really adequate protection against light to medium threats. What that means is I feel it would survive a fall from, say, waist level (or a little higher), just fine. Mind you, I have not been daring enough with my iPad to subject it to such a test, protected or not, but it did get knocked off the couch once while mounted in the cover and there wasnt the slightest issue with it. I do not know if it would take a heavy shotfor instance, if someone were to sit on it, say, on an uneven surface, Im not sure it would necessarily survive that. But thats pretty unusual. For most regular everyday problems  having it fall from your knapsack, or tumbling off a desk, and so on  I think it would survive just fine. And those are the normal problems one would face, I feel.And then I really like the cover. Not only does it look really cute -- I particularly love the colors I had (from the top down, my cover is green, dark green, and orange) but I think the case is nice and thin and easy to carry.And its overall thin and easy to handle, carry, pack, and so on. The cover adds virtually NO weight to the iPadits so light its almost negligible. Theres almost no feeling of bulkiness.So here are the couple of problemsFirst, and most important, this fit our iPad2 a little TOO snugglynot only is it extremely tight when I try to put it into the case, but every time I have to remove it I think its going to break off the tab holding it in.  I DO feel the case is protective, but its just a bit too tight and unyielding; I really worry that it will soon create some kind of breakageThis really mattered because there is no way to plug in my iPad at night in order to charge it. I HAD TO remove it from the case in order to charge it. If this werent such a struggle it would be a negligible problem, but this was difficult and kind of bothersome.Also, but this is really MINOR: the additional pockets dont really allow much ability to do more than a couple of post it notes or a bus card or two. They were so tight they were almost useless.All in all, I thought it was a decent case for protection and carrying: in those respects this was sweet.

"This ""kit"" consists of three rectangular bags that accept a great deal of luggage on their own, yet neatly fit into their own carrying pouches when not being used. It's a great systemized approach to packing and organization -- with a couple of notes that bear paying attention to as you're considering this great little system.First of all, think of what life is like for the traveler. There are lots of items that form the core of certain classifications of clothes, and that's what lies at the heart of their Ohuhu system - underwear and socks and belts, etc in the smallest bag, t-shirts and shorts, etc in the middle bag, and pants and larger shirts, and perhaps shoes in the biggest bag. To my way of thinking, these are all bags that will have to fit INSIDE of other bags --- they don't have handles, and one of the outside panels is made of a strong mesh - not the stuff you want to have exposed to the outside world. I have found it wise to pack these bags tight with luggage in order to maximize the bags' ability to keep order within your luggage...otherwise there can be shifting within them. Not a huge problem, but if your key concern is organization, then this would be the route I would take.However you'll pack them, they can remain the foundation of certain kinds of clothes or other items you might not need at all times...kind of the equivalent of drawers in a dresser. Think of them as items you might place in that drawer, or stick somewhere out of the way...but always want to know where they are.The outside of each bag gives a quick visual cue to the kind of items that might be in one bag vs. another -- underwear and socks, for instance - there is no telling what system you might want to come up with: maybe a certain case may hold items concerning health: band aids, suntan oil, etc. Maybe you just want to know where books that might be related to a particular point in your vacation touring, or items to keep your kids busy. Regardless, the possibilities are up to you.One thing I liked about the bags is that they fold up nicely into little attached cases made of the same material as the bags. If you follow the directions in the sixth picture on the product page it will help you accomplish this goal. It's a great way to keep them in small containers if they're not being used at the time: this is a great feature that will allow you to carry all three of the bags in some corners of your suitcase that won't take up any more combined space than, say, a couple of books. They also include a little white bag for just that purpose. (If you click on one of the pictures on the product page you'll not only get a close-up of the picture, but also an eighth photo that will show you the white container.)As for workmanship, all the bags I received seem to be in good condition: no loose strings, misaligned zippers, stitching problems, etc. (I did not see any indication of a warranty.)I was supplied this product free of charge with no condition other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A5EJ3UNHHTKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7N7PI8#wasThisHelpful","R3A5EJ3UNHHTKK","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up near NY City and there are certain rules you followed whenever you made the trip in, especially when you're alone:ALWAYS look as if you know where you're going. Even if you're a little lost, march someplace safe (like an eatery, or a grocery) and then get your bearings.NEVER take out a map in plain sight. If you must do it, find a place (like a discreet hallway or a bathroom) and take it out there.NEVER make eye contact with someone who looks ""unusual"" in this environment, edgy or confrontational.NEVER display any money. Make any transactions discretely, and do so as if you know what you're doing. And, more so...ALWAYS know what kind of change you're expecting.There are many more, especially in this new era, like NEVER hand someone your credit card, etc. (even in restaurants), but you get the drift. And the most important of all...When and if you get robbed, forget every other rule and give them WHATEVER THEY WANT...no argument.Anyway, the Landing Gear Money Belt is a great tool to avoid confrontation: it hides away (you can wear it on the outside of your clothes, but I prefer inside) and in that regard is very light and comfortable to wear. And it holds quite a lot. (If you keep a little cash in your pocket, and you prepare ahead of time to have your credit card or checkbook in your hand by the time you check out, there is really no reason for anyone to see you have this on.)The construction of the belt is superb, with double stitching everywhere and easy-to-grab zippers. The backing of the belt is a nice fiber mesh that feels comfortable against your skin  and the stretch belt is also well constructed, sewn into the fabric (and double-stitched) and is very comfortable around your back. And, while it is made of a stretchable elastic, it also allows for easy adjustments..I felt the bag looks stylish, though I would not personally like for the the belt to be seen by anyone. (It is a preferable thing for it to look nice, however.) Additionally, the fabric is quite visibly RipStop nylon (which can be seen by the little nylon squares in the stitching). This is an excellent fabric for durability -- as the name implies, it makes it a VERY difficult to rip.The uppermost pouch is approximately 11"" wide x 4 1/2,"" but within there are ALSO two slots, or pockets, within it that are about 6"" bx 3"" and 3"" x 3""...though the pouch's outer stitching would prevent something of that size being put in it. But, say, change would fit nicely.Also on the front, but lower, there is a 7 1/2"" x 3 1/2"" pouch as well. There are no inner pockets here. All in all, it is highly conceivable you could hide all your important credit cards, a checkbook or two, a decent-sized wallet (if you're a SEINFELD fan, I would not attempt to carry a George Castanza wallet...I think that might be pushing it.)Again, I was very impressed with Landing Gear's workmanship on this travel belt. I bent it and contorted it, and I felt that the bag seemed to hold up fine under worse than ideal wearing conditions. And again, there is an elastic loose-knit backing that lies against your skin, which allows for breath-ability on a hot day. (There is a slot on the upper left of this knit backing, so something could be slipped back here, too -- while there is a full 10"" x 5"" of area within this pouch, there is only a 2 3/4"" opening, so you could not slide anything larger than that into the pouch unless it bent or was rolled up, etc.)As for the elastic band that goes around your back, if fits me fine, and I have a 36"" waist. The band allows for someone several inches smaller, as well as someone several inches bigger, to wear it comfortably. I would caution that the elastic band is only 1"" wide, so it would be wise to get it to the most comfortable fit, as you wouldn't want the band to become uncomfortable over the course of time, especially on a hot day,Landing Gear claims that the synthetic fabric blocks RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) protection -- that is, this fabric blocks using special electromagnetic frequencies to try to discern the identification on any card you hold that has a magnetic strip on it. This seems to be a very important quality of protection. Additionally, the company warranties the product for one year -- a period of time that would, I believe, allow you to spot any defects in workmanship.I was supplied this product free of charge with no condition other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38Z1EHXMJZIZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NT7H5NQ#wasThisHelpful","R38Z1EHXMJZIZH","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A big term in sci-fi and fantasy is ""World Building,"" and it's a quality CITY OF STAIRS has in spades. From the quoted texts that lead in each chapter, through the spot-on characters that populate it, reinforced by the fully imagined culture that surrounds every scene -on these pages the city of Bulikov springs to life.  For centuries Bulikov had been a place almost beyond imagination, a city literally ruled over by the gods - but that was before the murderous coup did the impossible and struck them down, killing them off. And in doing so their assassins had hoped to exterminate all of the dieties' enchantments as well , even though they numbered in the thousands, even tens of thousands. From the creation of great buildings to the tiniest of daily activities, the astonishing ways of the divinities that had grown to make everyday life a glorious thing were now lost, and for many decades the city lay in ruins. It was a defeat enforced as much by the death of their gods as it was by those who usurped their powers: the bureaucrats of the nation of Saypur. These conquerors had no interest in seeing the city of Bulikov prosper - instead, they even passed laws of every sort to make sure that Bulikov's very history was forgotten, making it a crime to even speak the names of the deities or recall their old ways - in the many decades of their administration they had made illegal almost everything to do with their old belief system. As such, the native Saypuri culture languished, and its people felt the iron fist of repression.The novel begins a murder of a Saypuri Cultural Administrator, and in his place comes his unlucky replacement: Shara Thivani, a woman whose position is a front that allows her to investigate the death of her former mentor. Though she is a slight woman who cuts anything but an daunting persona, she is experienced enough to know how to get things done. Yet the strong-willed Shara is soon puzzled by the roadblocks being thrown in her way as she begins her investigation. Though she is initially stymied, has a few aces up her sleeve, and one of them is an imposing one-eyed man who stands almost seven feet tall - a man named Sigrud, whose face is marked by scars and whose manners are those of someone who answers to no one save Shara.What unfolds upon these pages is more than a who-done-it: it is a tale that winds its ways around these cultures through a skilled hand that permits us to see the large and the small with equally deft strokes of his pen...and through him we are introduced to a city-state that lies in shambles, a place whose inhabitants struggle to simply make it through another day while its administrators from Bulikov live lives of privilege and power.It is to Bennett's credit that we see a tapestry of life here: those who have, and those who make do. And, while the character of Sigrud is of course initially someone who captures our interest, I quickly became invested in Shara, a woman who makes her way through her demanding job by exercising the great strength of her mind. She is a woman who knows this culture inside and out, a woman of great sophistication, yet what I liked about her most where her contradictory quirks: though she is barely ninety pounds she consumes vast amounts of tea; and in the midst of cataclysmic events her greatest profanities are phrases like ""My goodness!"" and ""Oh, good gracious!"" She is a woman who is a strong patriot, yet has not touched her country's soil for 16 years. And while she holds her native country dear, she is not afraid to go against the strictures of its highest officials, especial one great aunt who holds her neck in a not-so-figurative noose.Lest you believe this to be a world in which the writing is only about politics, society and culture, rest assured that this is a story that still packs a visceral punch. There are monsters here, both of a figurative and literal sense. CITY OF STAIRS is a tale of intrigue that does not mind getting its boots dirty, a tale of a crumbling metropolis whose very walls hide demons and horrors that hint that its deities may not truly be dead. And though the incomparable Shara is determined to discover its secrets, she soon concludes that if her own compatriots are determined to stand in her way, she might be best served by working with her enemies.I think credit should go to Bennett also for the sheer interest level his book maintains from beginning to end. Additionally, Bennett is to be praised for maintaining a high quality of writing, as his book never sinks to easy solutions or cheap tricks to solve his lofty concepts. For instance, I initially worried that the story was going to be driven by whatever silly tasks they were going to give the monstrous Sigrud, yet while Bennett does not spare us some great scenes with the man, he did not rule the roost when it comes to action scenes.If there are any faults with this novel, I'd say they were not huge: I felt the pacing at the start was a bit slow, and at the end there is a relationship that is left very unresolved. But really, these are small complaints in a sea of praises. I'm glad I read CITY OF STAIRS, and if indeed there are to be sequel(s) as hinted, I would look forward to reading it/them. Based on what I have read here, I think I shall also read more of Bennett's other works as well.A NOTE FOR READERS WHO LIKED THIS BOOK: There are two books I think which are quite close in their striking abilities to tell a tale well, to create a fictional cast of characters with a life-giving touch, to build a story of considerable heft and weight, and to ""world build"" so well that you will find yourself looking for travel brochures. The first is well known:  The Golem and the Jinni (P.S.), by Helene Wecker. The second is one you will most likely never have known existed: Cornerstone, by Peter Diamantopoulos. Both, though, tell strong tales that have as much to do with story as they do with creating a vibrant and breathing world in which their characters can live and prosper. Ultimately, too, these are both strong, character-driven tales that will leave you wishing there were equally substantial sequels you could take off the shelf that minute and read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQE4ZHH4THMF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1ISJFA#wasThisHelpful","RQE4ZHH4THMF6","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:28 MinsThis is a very easy-to-use device that many will find indispensable. It is particularly indispensable to those who A) Don't like to fold shirts; B) Find they have a lot to do at one time; C) Care enough about things like shirts and such simple items that they don't want to simply throw them into a drawer or a suitcase willy-nilly the moment they pop out of the dryer; and D) Have limited time to do them.With this simple device one only needs to be able to lay out a t-shirt front side down, and the rest is simple: right side over the middle, left side over the middle, bottom up. Done.There are several of these kinds of devices (""As Seen on TV!"") out there, and I think they're relatively interchangeable. But this particular device does have clips on the right, left, and bottom pieces that allow the user to lengthen or shorten the device (for small, medium or large shirts), and that's nice.It is definitely a device one gets better at as one goes along...but as this is best used when there is a large number of t-shirts facing him/her, the person gets better at it relatively quickly.I've included in my video an alternate manner of folding shirts that doesn't require any equipment, and it's just about as fast a method of doing it. All one needs to do is lay it out neatly -- this time facing UP -- and follow the instructions I give you in the short video. The ONLY drawback is a minor one: as it varies the method of folding very slightly, the result differs a little bit. This method of folding requires a little more careful handling of the t-shirt after completion so that the ""final"" sleeve does not come loose.

"A Bit of Relevant Personal History: When I was about ten (half a century ago!) I was playing with my younger brother and I zigged when he zagged, and his dive for my legs met nothing but table...and he opened up a two inch gash right at the eyebrow level. There was blood everywhere...if you've ever been unlucky enough to be there when someone cuts his or her eyebrow you'll know just how much blood a cut like that can foster.Back to Now: To help prevent another horrible accident like this, these Ohuhu cushions for edges and corners are REALLY thick...about the thickness of a man's thumb. It's a substantial cushioning guard against those naked, sharp edges of coffee tables and stair rails and wall corners and whatever else there is around a house that could really hurt young kids. After seeing and touching these cushions, I am convinced that they are substantial enough to prevent injury should anyone, child or otherwise, accidentally bump into one. They are substantial foam cushions...Ohuhu touts that these are high density and extra soft, and from handling them I can only agree: they are very generous cushions and should amply protect any corner you fear might hurt a child who comes in contact with it.And, should you look at the photos provided, you'll see the padding fits nicely against the cornering cushions, and these are easy to cut into whatever lengths you'll need. The brown coloring is a relatively neutral color, and it will minimize its placement against any wood furniture, walls, etc.While there are 15 feet of cushions, they provide 30 feet of double-sided 3M tape - when you handle these big cushioning edges you'll realize that BOTH interior edges need to be affixed firmly for maximum safety.  Unless one makes some kind of heinous error, there should be ample tape for all the corners and edges they supply.Here are my only concerns:1. Though the kit says instructions are included, I did not receive any instructions.2. I found the 3M double-sided tape to be difficult to work with - that is, to peel. My fumble-y ""man fingers"" did not do a good job of working with these strips...I not only had trouble with getting the first backing strip off, but the second portion was nigh upon impossible. (I do want to stress, nonetheless, that 3M tape is a very good product. It's just small and thin.It's obvviously a concern one should weigh when thinking of setting up this form of safety measure.3. I have a concern that should the double-sided tape spend any substantial time on varnished surfaces, or paint, or any other similarly damage-able surface, I worry that the tape might tear off or scar whatever surface it was taped to. I wonder if it might have been safer to simply use small Velcro tabs every foot or so, thus causing less potential area for scarring. Looking through 3M's products, I found no information that these strips were easily removable once they were used, so my assumption is that they might take some of the product off when removed.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CEV47U0CMDTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R45JPZK#wasThisHelpful","R2CEV47U0CMDTB","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not expecting to like this film so much.While the Spiderman movies have always been watchable and even sometimes involving, I'd felt that they had lately gotten a little too angst-y for my tastes, too involved in expressing teenage issues and romance over the more enjoyable action angles. Let's face it: I wasn't paying $25 per ticket (and food) in order to see how Parker's love life was doing.But I found this movie to be almost immediately entertaining and the action scenes were snappy and drove the story quite well. There were little glitches at times, but overall I found this to be a rich and exciting movie.Like I said, I wasn't so sure at the start. I immediately cringed when I determined what passed for dialogue here...the movie aimed for what I call the ""Shia LaBeouf"" style of patter that dearly wants to feel it's being honest and realistic, bur really all it does is have the characters talk over each other's lines and mutter endlessly...it devalues dialogue to the point of my not caring at all. Here, though, Jamie Foxx's early depiction of Max Dillon was so purposely shy that he became a doormat for almost everyone, and his inability to articulate or project his dialogue displayed that very point.But what made this film so enjoyable for me was its terrific visual style; this movie, more than any of its predecessors , revels in its titular characters' unique method of locomotion, and it is a remarkable thing to watch in this movie. This time around director Marc Webb (The Amazing Spider-Man, (500) Days Of Summer) used cinematographer Daniel Mindel (the two latest Star Trek movies) and the change is for the better...this film is A LOT more visually stunning than the last. Replete with crystalline, lucid photography and powerful moments of ""trapped"" motion, the scenes of Spidey looping his way through Manhattan have such crackling visual power and kinetic energy that it's almost impossible to do anything else but be dazzled by it. I really felt like I was swooping along with Spiderman, and it consistently makes for a gloriously fun ride.In addition, there are other clever, unusual pluses in the film: for one thing, there is a playfulness within that strikes at unusual times. For example, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) wants so badly to talk to Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) that he often makes ridiculous mistakes: for instance, there's one throwaway moment when he is so eager to speak to Gwen that he uses his web to swoop down to speak to her still wearing his civvies. At another point he comes in close quarters with a cop blaring away on a megaphone, and after the man in blue speaks right into Spiderman's face our hero in turn shouts out his own next few lines, temporarily deaf.And while I'm really not a fan of Jamie Foxx, I thought he did all right here. For me, Jamie Foxx movies often suffer because the actor tries too hard to eat up the scenes - like, say, Vin Diesel or Tom Cruise. He often has that ""Golly, aren't I terrific?"" quality -- but here I thought his role was very submerged. In fact, as I mentioned earlier his character was so mousy he almost disappeared.A little sidebar, here, in fact: I've often felt our villains tell a lot about the concerns of society: Rodan and Godzilla speak to a nation frightened by nuclear power, for instance, or global terrorism within the DIE HARD franchise, or increased depersonalization in films like The Matrix. Here, Foxx's Dillon becomes Electro after a dispute with his bosses at work. In essence, one could argue he is bears a strong resemblance to those ripped from our own headlines. Certainly, we don't feel sympathy for those in our own society who fight with their managers, then go home, gather their weapons, and return to their workplace in order to shoot it out with anyone who stands in their way. Yet our comic book sympathy increases ESPECIALLY if that very same person has that same initial confrontation -- and then falls into a very conveniently placed vat of electric eels.  Particularly because, in the latter case, you've got yourself a Super Villain.The movie makes some odd choices...I think if we haven't overworked the Nazi mad doctor (even in comic strips) we've come awfully close, and Dr. Alex Kafka (?) and his over-sized black rubber gloves, though true to the comic, may be that one time too many.But I think the award for The Most Misused Hollywood Star may be won here, as Paul Giamatti is all but invisible in this film. Granted, they're setting him us up for the NEXT film, but when will that come along? 2018? Here, I doubt most people even knew he was in the movie.But here's a personal Cry Out to ALL MOVIES EVERYWHERE: could we stop, for all time, the trope that has our hero stop the bad guy, then turn our back on him before they are sure the criminal is down and completely out? It happens at the start of this movie, during a fight aboard a private jet in which our hero's parents are duking it out with a Bad Man who has sabotaged their plane. They overcome him, but then OF COURSE, our hero turns his back on the bad guy, who OF COURSE, comes back to life.. When, oh when, will Hollywood stop using this gimmick?","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RAPXSALSWI3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPO064C#wasThisHelpful","R1RAPXSALSWI3A","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This us a great pair of gloves.First of all, they fit great (more on that in a minute), they are plush, and the thick fabric really keeps the hot objects you're holding away from your skin. In this manner you can hold the item longer, which is essential if you're a wood stove owner like me. With wood stoves, one has to occasionally reach in and physically grab a piece of wood and move it, and if the glove you're using cannot insulate you from the object you're touching, you're in big trouble.In addition, these gloves come with silicone grips (the lines colored blue), which not only give you a better grip on anything you pick up, but also has the trait of holding the item even further away from your skin. Again, this is extremely important, as anyone who handles these items will tell you. These grips will come in very handy to anyone handling hot pan handles or movingAs an added feature the gloves have good wrist coverage, which should be an obvious plus.In fact, this pair of gloves is rated as heat resistant up to 662 degrees Fahrenheit...I don't want to minimize the seriousness and importance of getting burned, but doesn't that sound awfully specific? (It makes one wonder what that particular testing session was like: ""It's okay...okay...okay...Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!)But on a more serious note, back to the fit: while they do not have a ""true"" thumb placement like a real pair of gloves, this is mitigated by the fact that they are made of a ""giving"" cloth fabric, which allows the thumb to shift over to a more ""true"" position. In case you wonder why this is important, try handling a several hundred degree piece of wood with a hand whose thumb is essentially misplaced-- where the thumb is in fact working against you -- and you'll quickly understand why having a thumb that is easy to use is so important. Plasticky or rubberized gloves will have this problem...using them is tricky and can require a lot of caution. But not these...they fit well.But there is a hidden plus to all this: you essentially have four gloves. Where this is important is: let's say you have a left-hand glove whose middle digit has torn or finally succumbed to a burn or some other similar problem...just wear that glove on your RIGHT hand from now on, and you can put that hole on the BACK of that hand's middle finger. It's a truly nice way to extend the wear or life of a pair of gloves.Realize too, there are more uses for these gloves than just around wood stoves: they can be used around grills, around normal stoves, around campfires, around fireplaces, and even changing light bulbs or handling frozen objects. In addition, the company recommends keeping them clean, as dirt or grime can reduce their effectiveness.They are one size fits all, and while they look huge at first glance one must realize that one of their assets is that they are many layered in order to increase their insulation. I always wear large-sized gloves, and these fit my hands just fine, with room to spare.NOTE: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review ... which this is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FH3SUDO000I7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PS5T2II#wasThisHelpful","R2FH3SUDO000I7","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This towel is billed at 60 x 30 inches, and it easily measures that -- my towel measured about 61.5"" by 30.5"". And it is soft, but realize it is thin. I think it's about the thickness of a soft shirt. The fabric is ultra smooth and comfortable to the touch. Its edges (hems?) are firmly and pleasantly stitched, so to all appearances it has a durable construction that will last a good long time.Given these dimensions -- especially its soft but thin quality -- I think one of its main pluses is that it can quite easily be folded into the size of about a trade paperback book, about 8 by 5 inches and an inch thick (It comes with a nice little bag that easily accepts it if you fold it with a minimum of care). Therefore, it would be easy to pack into a carry-on bag on an airplane, freeing you from having to use one of the blankets airlines hand out -- I never trust them for cleanliness or being germ free, whereas this would be. The manufacturer says that it has an antibacterial coating that prevents mold. Additionally, it could be used on car trips or simply sitting on your couch watching TV -- it cannot replace, say, a terrycloth robe or blanket, but it certainly is very soft and pleasant to cover oneself on the couch.Another positive quality it has is that it can absorb quite a bit of moisture. I used it to dry myself off as I came out of the shower, and it did a fine job -- the moisture almost seems to instantly disappear. I'm in my sixties, so if you have a full mane of hair you may require more than my paltry 'do, but as I said it did a fine job of drying me off. But it almost takes no time at all to dry...if you can hang it up on a hook (it comes with a nice little strap) for 15 minutes or so it feels almost completely dry. (The company says it will soak up three times its weight, and I have no reason to doubt that claim.)Therefore, I can certainly also recommend it as a towel for the gym. Not only does it do a fine mob of toweling me off after a shower, its quality of almost instantly feeling dry again is something that makes it ideal for a gym bag, or a towel to take along on a bicycle trip, or hiking, or a picnic lunch, or game bleachers, or a concert or almost anywhere one requires a lightweight cloth for sitting upon, drying off, placing on the ground as a barrier against sitting on dirt, or to soften a hard bench or bleacher seating.

Add to that a thoroughly swayed wife: a woman of great mental and personal prowess in ALL other areas save one regarding an inordinately cute dog that looks like a baby bear in pajamas EVERY FREAKIN' DAY OF ITS LIFE.Regardless, this review is about Natural Balance, and its effectiveness as to my dogs. One of our dogs, Abbey, had been breaking out with skin issues some time back, and we made a great deal of effort to solve it. After countless steroid injections and shampoo trials, etc, we decided to take a food trial with a novel protein as its source: RABBIT. And it worked.Abbey's skin issues have ceased. We have been CONVINCED by our prolonged and repeated time periods of its use that Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance dog food is the answer to our dog's sensitive digestive issues.We didn't come by NB on a whim; we tried A LOT of other dog foods first -- as anyone knows who is considering buying this product (or ones with equal claims), NB (and those others) are expensive.  However, I will also put it to you that so are food-oriented and/or medical skin treatments. My wife and I weighed the two and felt this made the wisest choice.The key, we found, was the neutral qualities offered by deer and rabbit -- but trying to find brands that offered them in a dry food of sufficient quality was next to impossible. We liked the quality of Royal Canin, but a more than six-pounds SMALLER 17.7 lb. bag of RC hypoallergenic potato and rabbit or potato and venison dry food comes at costs approaching $100 at the time of this posting. That comes in at over $5 a POUND (compared to NB's coming at less than HALF that: about $2.17 a pound).NB's food is well-rounded and consistent and has a great list of high quality ingredients.-- you go through the first three ingredients (potatoes, rabbit and potato protein) before one runs into one with a chemical compound (and that's just the preservative in the canola oil), and then it's beet pulp, natural flavor, flax seed, salt, salmon oil and various vitamins and minerals.My wife and I liked that NB created a mix that's ""rich in protein and low in fat,"" as well as concentrating on foods that emphasize carbs, potassium and other highly digestible energy sources. And just as much, our dogs LOVE the taste. Not that Corgis refuse much food (I seriously wonder if they couldn't digest a car tire), but it is a consistent winner at our house and most importantly, WITHOUT any skin issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GSL8KLR5LJEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JR99W2M#wasThisHelpful","R2GSL8KLR5LJEK","A6WZVL0SRQAPY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6WZVL0SRQAPY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A General Theory of Oblivion is a unique little book, constructed as a series of vignettes that circle around a central story of a woman nicknamed Ludo who walled herself into one apartment of a building in Luanda, Angola, and lived isolated and alone for many years.  That central core of the novel is based on a true story, but the web of secondary characters is equally fascinating.  There are people from each side of the country's revolutionary divide; in fact, the set of characters got a bit confusing (who is doing or has done what to whom?), and their paths occasionally intersected in ways I found unreasonably coincidental.  Still, I admired the author's vision and writing skill (his words translated from Portuguese), and the book surprised and intrigued me with its unusual tale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RP6KJ2VRH3TR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0914671316#wasThisHelpful","R1RP6KJ2VRH3TR","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have an iPhone 6, and I tested this Belkin Lightning charger & sync cable and compared it to the regular, non-""lightning"" cables I already had.  In my totally unscientific tests, the Belkin Lightning cable averages about half a minute  to a minute for each percent in charging.  For example, it would charge 20 percent in about 20 minutes' time or less.  My other cables charge at an average of about 2.5 to 3 minutes per percent.  The Belkin is faster, though I question whether the term ""lightning"" really applies.  As far as syncing goes, the Belkin seems to sync at about the same speed as the other cables, probably a bit faster.I do have a use for the short (6 in) cable, but if I had this to do over again, I would go for a longer cable.

"David Mitchell's new novel Slade House is bit different than his others, but then nearly everything he has written has been ""different"" in some way or other.  This one is indirectly connected to The Bone Clocks, his much longer book from a year ago, but Slade House works just fine as a stand-alone piece.  It's also the closest Mitchell has come to writing in the horror genre, or it could fit into the similar category of ""dark fantasy.""  The novel is an intriguing tale of various individuals who find their way to an old English house that's tucked away down a dark alley and can only be accessed at certain times and by certain people.  There may be an Evil Presence at Slade House that they will have to contend with.  The book is divided into five sections, happening in 1979, '88, '97,  '06, and the present day.  Each year's tale is told from the POV of a different visitor to Slade House.  Their fates are interconnected, but as I'm trying to avoid spoilers, I'll say no more about that.I was thoroughly engrossed in Slade House's gradually unfolding mystery, rooting against the bad guys and hoping somehow good would triumph in the end.  The story is well told, with a bounty of fascinating, spooky, and imaginative ideas related to the central plot concepts and themes.  I recommend it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26N46MZKZGI7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812998685#wasThisHelpful","R26N46MZKZGI7O","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"(CD review) Despite the foray into ""rock"" her band Helen represents, listeners familiar with Liz Harris' work as Grouper shouldn't be too surprised by this new music.  True, the Helen sound does have more of a basis in guitar-bass-drums, usually electric guitar, and is more ""song"" oriented, but the tracks on the Helen album share one major element with Grouper: a love of blurred, insubstantial, and impressionistic musical effects. In particular, Ms Harris' vocals on Helen are often even less decipherable than on the Grouper recordings.  Here we also have fuzzy guitars, somewhat shoegaze-ish, and the tunes generally have a melodic structure along the lines of garage rock.  But that's all buried within a sea of gauze.  The music could have been recorded with several layers of cotton covering the mics, or sometimes it's like it was recorded by mics placed down the hall from where the musicians were playing. I'm OK with all the abstraction (as I was with it in Grouper), but it is more of an interesting curiosity than anything I'll want to return to.  Then there's a minor frustration I have with the packaging, which contains only scribbled, mostly illegible handwriting.  If you want to learn who else plays in the band or the song names, you'll have to go online, a likely intentional irony in our transition from physical product to purely digital media.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GANZWFL2PHX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119TA848#wasThisHelpful","R3GANZWFL2PHX0","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reading ""In Camera,"" the brilliant novella that opens William Gass' new story collection, I had such high hopes for the book.  The next novella, ""Charity,"" promptly smashed those hopes to bits.  ""In Camera"" starts *Eyes* out in stimulating fashion, portraying an eccentric proprietor of an obscure photograph shop and his Quasimodo-esque assistant/ward.  The tale is filled with intriguing ideas, marvelous descriptions, and apt details.  On the other hand, ""Charity"" drew the same reaction from me that trying to read *Ulysses* did: perplexity, frustration, anger, and (finally) rejection.  The Gass novella is one continuous without a paragraph break--for dozens of pages.  It abruptly, jarringly shifts time and perspective during the narrative.The remaining stories include ones written from the POVs of a folding chair and a piano, respectively, neither of which was too awful, plus one clear winner (""The Man Who Spoke With His Hands""), leading to a concluding work, ""The Toy Chest"" that explores odd spellings, punctuations, and formatting.Lately it's seemed like every other story collection I've picked up is from an ""experimental"" author of fiction.  I've loved some (George Saunders) and disliked others (Charles Yu).  *Eyes* is somewhere in between, but at its worst, it is relatively horrible.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSJEWXIO8HQDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101874724#wasThisHelpful","RSJEWXIO8HQDJ","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It follows the successful approach of explaining not just the correct answers, but also why the wrong answers are incorrect.

"(3 & 1/2 stars)The Girl With The Deep Blue Eyes begins with a familiar noir plot -- hard-bitten former cop now working as a PI is assigned to check on a beautiful spouse of an abusive rich man -- and then things take a predictable course between the PI, Doak, and the wife, Lisa.  It doesn't take too long before the story starts to get twisty & kinky.  Eventually there are several surprises, not least of which was the ending, which was not what I expected at ALL.  The novel falls a bit short on character development -- I never got much of a picture in my mind of Lisa, for instance -- but, the plot was interesting enough to keep my reading, albeit at a pace less than ""page-turner"" speed.  Oh, and about the kinky side...Lawrence Block's regular readers will not be shocked to hear that Girl w/ Blue Eyes gets pretty explicit.

"Reading Mal Peet's fantasy parody novel *The Mudstone Trilogy* reminded me at times of reading National Lampoon's legendary Tolkien parody called *Bored of the Rings*.  That book came out in 1969, and it was grade-A humor, but it also did not hold together as a story on its own.  Its sole value was as a parody, but of course that was the point of the book.  With the late Mr. Peet's Murdstone Trilogy, he was apparently trying to make it work in both areas, but he didn't really succeed in either.I like various conceits on the parody side, especially when the agent, Minerva, lays out the ""formula"" for plotting out a fantasy trilogy.  The generic elements she describes are pretty apt, and funny!  On the ""story"" side, the writer Murdstone is a pretty unsympathetic lead character, and his actions often don't fit any sensible pattern of behavior.  Some secondary characters, such as the two librarian sisters, are amusingly drawn, but others, like the villain Morl, are just flat sketches.  This novel also has a title problem, as it has the word ""Trilogy"" in its title, something that could confuse potential readers looking for three books.  (The title is fully explained within the novel, but I'm not sure many will make that far.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7KR0D44S2UB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763681849#wasThisHelpful","R7KR0D44S2UB4","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Matt Bell's new novel *Scapper* is an extraordinary book, but it's also relatively baffling as a coherent story.  The main character, Kelly, is a man who ""scraps"" for a living in the ruins of Detroit.  His life is changed when he finds and rescues a kidnapped boy while he's tearing through an abandoned house in ""the zone.""  However, Kelly doesn't change in the ways a predictable story-telling arc would dictate.  He remains a troubled man with a traumatic episode in his past, something involving a woman and her boy (a different boy than the rescued one).There are MANY unconventional elements to *Scrapper*, primarily the vague and not always comprehensible events that take place in the plot.  There are switches in perspective that left me behind for awhile until I caught up.  There are two SIDE tales, ""Guantanamo"" and ""Pripyat,"" which appear to have little or no relevance to the rest of the novel.  Then there's the author's writing style, which includes delivering a load of sentences with poetic or literary impact (perhaps), but which often make no real sense.  A blurb quote for this book says, ""Matt Bell does not write sentences--he writes spells.""  In my case, at least, I'm sure I would have gotten more out of *Scrapper* and enjoyed it more had Mr. Bell stuck to sentences and avoided the spells.  And for the plot, despite several other compelling points, how about providing something as basic as WHAT exactly happened to Kelly in his deep dark past?  That wouldn't have required too much, just a flashback that filled in the details.  However, I guess the author chose not to do that because it would have been too straightforward and not consistent with the blurry, dreamlike quality he was going for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FSU5W3JOKZ4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161695521X#wasThisHelpful","R2FSU5W3JOKZ4H","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In the Intro, series editor David Wixon explains that a total of fourteen volumes of Simak fiction are planned after this first one, which is both thrilling and a bit intimidating.  I'll have to read them all.  What strikes me most about this volume is how timeless this master's writing is!  There are some chronologically dated references that are unavoidable (ex., a million dollars doesn't sound as impressive in 2015 as it did 50 years ago), but so many other elements of the author's writing and ideas are just as fascinating and engrossing now as they were when they were published.

"My 6-year-old Lab and 9-year-old Shepherd mix love these duck treats.  I am reporting back after gradually giving them a whole bag a couple at a time over several days, and I can say that they've had no ill health effects.  In fact, their annual checkup at the vet's fell during that time, and the doc said both doggies are in very good shape.  I was a little concerned that the bag only says these treats are PACKED in the US, but does not tell where they are made.  I contacted the company and asked the question.

"In my customer rating for this book, I had to give Dianne Cook extra credit for creativity.  In this collection of stories, we find ideas that are so ""out there"" as to be bizarre or even ridiculous, but she takes her imaginative scenarios and carries them out to whatever extremes she envisions.  They all fit, in one way or another, into the title theme of ""Man V. Nature,"" and often Nature drives Man to take actions universally condemned by civilized society.  In other words, frequently various forms of extreme and/or ordinarily abhorrent behavior are described in these short stories, something which will likely offend some readers--but it makes for a book that is NEVER boring!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33CPF51N2Y9NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062333100#wasThisHelpful","R33CPF51N2Y9NP","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(3 & 1/2 stars)The individual pouches (or tubes) of this instant coffee can be mixed with hot water to make a nice cup-a-joe.

For an instant coffee, Partners Blend is fairly rich and high quality in the area of flavor.

"My main problem with this book is that the plot is too slow to unfold.  With its gradually revealed mysteries, the story is reminiscent of the TV series Lost and The Prisoner, but only in bad ways.  I have one other major issue with More Than This, however, and that is that it's inappropriately described as a book for Young Adults, even marketed for schools.  The book contains sexual scenes, a fair amount of four-letter words, and other elements that make it clearly unsuitable for a school reading program.  I'm not against those things in books for adults--I often read them myself without any concern.

"Author Thomas Pierce falls loosely into the ""zany short story writer"" category, in that many of his stories revolve around bizarre concepts such as a TV show that creates living clones of ancient extinct animals (""Shirley Temple Three"") and a woman who lives out an entire, detailed parallel life in the world of a continuing dream (""The Real Alan Gass"").  The unique element of Pierce's stories is that he takes these alternate realities and makes everything else about them seem relatively ordinary, including the characters (people with problems), settings, and plot points.  While I generally appreciated the writing, it was a bit difficult for me to settle on a final star-rating for Hall of Small Mammals.  I wanted to give Pierce extra credit for his creativity and skill, but was less than satisfied by the story endings, many of which were annoyingly enigmatic or arbitrary.  (Yes, I know, authors should be allowed to do that, plus the short story form often makes ""neatly wrapped up"" endings impractical, but I would still have liked better constructed endings than most of these stories had.)

"Full Measure, T. Jefferson Parker's new novel, takes the reader in unexpected directions as it develops.  The main characters are brothers Patrick and Ted Norris, each struggling with major personal issues.  Patrick is a returning war veteran haunted by ghosts of fallen comrades; Ted is physically limited and has a personality conflict with his demanding farming father.  A blurb quote for this book (from Stephen Harrigan) compares this writing to John Steinbeck's, and the comparison is apt.  Besides having the West Coast setting in common, Parker portrays events similar to Steinbeck's interpersonal dramas of hard-luck people scratching and clawing to get by. But the plot is more than character studies -- the Norris family is in tough straits, and we're not sure how (or if) they will make it through.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZVDNNBM002L0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250052009#wasThisHelpful","RZVDNNBM002L0","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ransom Island, the third Miles Arceneaux story, is again set in the Texas Gulf Coast area, although this book takes place in the 1950s.  It's fun to connect these '50s characters, including a different set of Sweetwater brothers, to characters in the chronologically-later first and second books.  The plot involves a mob bid to take over Shady's, the brothers' relatively isolated and ""local"" entertainment operation (food, fishing, music, and libations), plus there are preparations being made for a major musical figure's planned concert at the club.  I enjoyed the good-guys-vs-bad element of this tale, which also includes a not-always-serious yet period-appropriate look at the racial tensions of the time.  In fact, the handling of that touchy subject (race) is a good illustration of the Arceneaux approach to historical accuracy -- a good ear for how things were discussed and handled at the time, but with a vein of humor always nearby, ready to be mined.  The novel moves along briskly, is frequently grin-inducing (I'm not an LOL'er), and the CCQ (colorful character quotient) is the highest yet for a Miles book.  If you dug the first two books, you will love this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11ZV7U3SW6FOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1622880854#wasThisHelpful","R11ZV7U3SW6FOA","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Barbara Cofer Stoefen is the mother of an addict who felt that her story could be helpful to others who were facing a similar situation.  Her teenaged daughter Annie became addicted to crystal meth at the end of high school and as Annie became a legal adult, the situation changed dramatically as far as treatment options and the law were concerned.  I read this story with interest--while I have no firsthand experience with a family member going through addiction (thankfully), I have followed the subject of meth addiction.Ms Cofer Stoefen relates events in a very realistic way, laying bare all of the confusion, anger, frustration, anxiety, and other emotions she went through during this time in her and Annie's lives.  While there are recommendations and resources offered at the end of the book, A Very Fine House is not written as an advice book.  It is just a mom talking about what happened to her family, figuring things out as she went along.  It is also a book about faith in God, and the heart of the book details the author's initial struggle with ""how could God let this happen to us?"" followed by her attempts to find a solution that would draw on her spiritual support and love for her daughter.I typically avoid ""religious books,"" but I found this to be a refreshingly honest and non-preachy account, pretty well-written and engrossing throughout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YETGUXDXEHR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310344417#wasThisHelpful","R2YETGUXDXEHR3","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She falls in with ""the wrong crowd,"" a trio of high-living classmates, and her fate is essentially sealed in that moment.  While the story has a gripping and irresistible forward momentum, I found the characters' behavior consistently annoying throughout the book.  This gets into the classic debate about whether a novelist has still written a good story if the characters are all unsympathetic or even repulsive to the reader.  Certainly that is possible, except in this case I had another problem with Abroad, that the plot kind of stagnated for me -- too much meaningless partying and ""living it up,"" to the point of repetitiveness.  Only a couple of scenes stood out, when the four ""friends"" manage to intrude on an exclusive ""secret society"" party they were not invited to, as well as their ""weekend at the castello.""

"(4 stars for the studio collection, 1 star for the live disc)The ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ARTO set has one excellent CD, a cross section of material from across Arto Lindsay's career.  The song selection is satisfying, with a mix of English and Portuguese (Brazilian) tunes, and the sound quality is splendid.  It's not exactly ""Arto Lindsay's Greatest Hits,"" but it serves as a fine overview of what the man is all about, at least in the studio.To let us hear what Lindsay is like in concert, we get a set performed in May 2012 at Pete's Candy Store in Brooklyn, seemingly in front of about 20 people (judging from the applause).  My reaction to hearing this raw, awful noise was ""Note to self: do NOT go see Arto Lindsay perform live.""  Instead of playing his electric guitar as a musical instrument, he instead uses it to reproduce all kinds of ""speaker malfunction"" sounds -- shrieks, distortions, pulsations, squawks, etc.  In between, around, and over those cringe-inducing aural assaults, Mr. Lindsay ""sings"" lyrics, although often he is just mumbling or ""yipping.""

"The title of Ken Silverstein's new nonfiction book is The Secret World of Oil, but the chapters vary in how well they address aspects of the oil industry that are ""secret.""  One area where he mostly succeeds is in his stories of the ""fixers,"" important but little-known figures who serve as go-betweens for petroleum exploration companies interested in making deals with oil-producing countries (and the dictators who run them).  These guys, the fixers, are a unique and often shady lot, but they serve a valuable and necessary function in the process.It was my expectation that this book would reveal hidden industry practices relating to oil drilling, transportation, refining, and the like, but Silverstein focuses much more on the business side.  (If I took a hint from the cover art, perhaps this wouldn't have been a surprise.)  There are lawyers and lobbyists, traders and politicians.  Sometimes the author strays fairly far from his main topic, as when he profiles Glencore, the world's largest commodities brokerage firm.  They trade in all kinds of commodities, not just petroleum, but particularly zinc, copper, coal, and grain.  Some chapters help us learn things that we already know, such as that dictators who run small Third World countries are usually in it for their own gain and not the betterment of their citizens.The Secret World also has a ""thrown together"" kind of feel, as the author seems to just say, ""OK, I'm done with that topic -- now onto another.""  Apart from their connection by the topic of the oil industry (and sometimes even that is missing), there's no clear overarching narrative.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ3551YK94NNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781681376#wasThisHelpful","RQ3551YK94NNT","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Why buy a ""designer"" pet food? A couple of good reasons would be concern about the quality of the food (remember the pet food recalls due to contamination in China?) and the nutritional value of the food (cats and dogs are of the scientific order Carnivora, which means  ""flesh eaters"", not ""grain eaters""). The makers of Nutrience Grain Free Cat Food emphasize that their food is made in small batches in human-grade manufacturing facilities from local (Canada, US) ingredients.  The ingredients more closely replicate a carnivore diet of protein combined with fruits, vegetables, herbs, probiotics and other nutrients.I asked a close friend to test this on her beautiful 17-year-old cat, Amber. She's in good health for her age, with some joint pain due to arthritis.  Amber has eaten a well-known dry cat food her whole life, but we thought the ingredients in Nutrience might be more beneficial in helping her remain healthy and active in her golden years.Of course, the big question was: would Amber eat it? My friend's few attempts to switch to other cat food brands through the years had been failures due to Amber's evident and total dislike of the new food. The suggestions on the Nutrience package were followed and it was slowly added in greater proportions to her bowl of dry food. The changeover was a complete success, taking less than a week. The morsels of food are small and crumble fairly easily, requiring less effort for her to chew them. This may be one reason she now almost empties the bowl of food, something that didn't happen with the previous brand.We are hoping the glucosamine and chondroitin in the Nutrience Grain Free Cat Food will alleviate some of Amber's arthritic pain, but it's too early to tell. All we can say is she seems pretty perky for an old kitty!My thanks to Cris & Amber for participating in this trial run!UPDATE:  Although Amber loves this food, we have learned that the high-protein aspect is not so good for older cats like her.  We had to switch her back to the previous food.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T4YZCLX74TBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDZTVXG#wasThisHelpful","R1T4YZCLX74TBS","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Mr. Finn's work this time out has an occasional nice tune (the last two in particular), but it also gives us a horrendous mess of a song called ""Divebomber.""

Trying to avoid spoilers, I will say that I became engrossed in Mr. Sullivan's future Hollow World, and I was especially intrigued by the dilemmas that occur when a contemporary man pops up in the middle of a seemingly ""perfect"" society.  The plot also followed a surprising path -- at first I thought the author was clumsy in guiding the reader through the plot, but eventually I just ""went with the flow"" and stayed tuned-in all the way through.  Hollow World could be categorized as an unusual take on the Time Travel subgenre of SF, but it's really much more of a ""future society"" novel.  Time travel is just the way Ellis gets to the New World.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R213E8C4Z65WYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161696183X#wasThisHelpful","R213E8C4Z65WYM","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of ""Emerald Rush: Lush Gardenia & White Tea Essence"" body wash by Caress.  The first thing that struck me about the product was its very pleasant scent, which has the floral notes indicated in the name.  Beyond that important element, this body wash is similar to just about any other body wash you might be familiar with, although it does perhaps apply and spread a bit more smoothly than some of its competitors.  Anyway, I like it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR6NM1MABAD80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSNWXZM#wasThisHelpful","RR6NM1MABAD80","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In her new novel, Casebook, acclaimed author Mona Simpson provides an unusual perspective of a dissolving marriage and disrupted family.  As things between his mom and dad begin pulling apart, Miles begins a series of amateur espionage activities designed to help him understand what is really happening.  He is often assisted in these endeavors by his best friend Hector.  In constructing this scenario, Ms Simpson is taking something very universal -- a child's desire to understand something that makes no sense and is disturbing to his or her life -- and approaching it in a pretty unique way.  As Miles and Hector begin uncovering more information, naturally the picture becomes more muddy rather than clear.  They also learn some life lessons about the Principle of Unintended Consequences from their actions.  Through it all, the writer's skills and straightforward storytelling style kept me interested in the characters and plot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PF9HILKL807J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385351410#wasThisHelpful","R2PF9HILKL807J","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The one thing I did like about this Nivea shave cream was that it left my skin feeling refreshed when I was finished shaving.However, here are three BIG problems with the product:1. The shave I got from the Nivea cream was less close than with the generic shaving cream I had been using before this.  I had to go over my face again with my electric razor.2. It takes a large quantity of Nivea shave cream for a single shave.  It comes in a toothpaste-like tube, and I had to squeeze out more than a dozen inch-long squirts of cream before I was done -- just for one shave of my face.3. The Nivea cream uses some kind of sticky substance to help the cream bind to your skin as you massage it in, presumably designed to yield a closer shave.  Not only did it fail on that count, but the sticky stuff also made it bind to the razor blades as well, to the point where it was much harder to wash off than regular shaving cream.  PLUS, it stuck to my wash cloth and towel!  This problem #3 was the worst one of all, and was what made me throw the Nivea shave cream away after one use.PS - When I first removed the cap, I noticed there was no safety seal of any kind over the tube opening.  I don't know the rules for this (FDA?), but I think there should be a seal.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XRBTPCCZYNTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXZSAE4#wasThisHelpful","R2XRBTPCCZYNTV","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his riveting new account of a headline-grabbing, early-20th-century murder story, Harold Schechter informs modern audiences about the ""Mad Sculptor"" case.  At the time it happened, the case held the entire nation's attention for a few weeks.  (It was that year's ""Crime of the Century."")  The way Schechter wrote it, The Mad Sculptor is not a suspenseful ""whodunnit"" (although there is some suspense during the ""manhunt"" portion of the book).  Instead, it's a tale of mental illness leading to murderous obsession, also providing a view of the tabloid media of the era, what police crime-solving methods were like in those days, and how little mental health was understood back then.  One of the main attractions of the book is getting to know the unique characters who populate its pages: the drunken father/husband of the victims, the beautiful model who was the killer's main target, the famous & colorful defense lawyer, etc.  The story is also well told and apparently was well researched by the author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJJPI2UEMV539/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544114310#wasThisHelpful","RJJPI2UEMV539","A4OSXRZR2BMX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OSXRZR2BMX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have 5 kids and 2 of them are little so we have a few drops to experience this protection.I really like the design overall. The buttons are really easy to use and work nicely.

My husband keeps eyeballing it so I'm probably going to be buying one for him for Christmas, but the sound is great. You can feel all the bass this little speaker pumps out.

"Very nice face scrub. And I want to say why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars off the start. The reason is the fragrance is a little strong, so even while I was using the scrub (which the scrub itself is amazing) the scent was a bit strong for me.That being said the scrub is amazing. I didn't need but just a little bit to scrub my entire face. I was able to apply it and just rub it all over my face and it felt amazing. I think I could feel all the dead skin and ickiness in my skin being scrubbed away.After rinsing (which it was super easy to rinse out), my face felt so smooth. I can't  explain in words how soft and amazing my skin felt. It was great. I love the feeling of the scrub.

"These cables work great. My kids had destroyed most of my hdmi cables. I don't even know how but they did. These cables seem to be a little more durable. I really like the braided cord, those always seem to last a little longer.It was just the perfect link between my tv, which I have mounted on the wall, and my dvr box on a stand.

I didn't need to worry at all because these glasses are ADORABLE. I really love them. They fit really nicely on my face, and look great on me.I really like the polarized lenses. If you have never owned a pair of the polarized glasses before you need to. It makes the biggest difference in the world. Everything is in such sharp focus. There is not glare and everything looks so clear. You will love it, and you must try it.

"Oh i have one happy hubby. My husband has a custom bobber that he loves almost more than our children. One thing this motorcycle has never had is blinkers. This was always something that worried me, because not everyone pays attention to people on bikes and that really is terrifying. One way to help be seen more is of course blinkers.Well we couldn't have just regular blinkers on this custom bobber. It looks mean so I wanted to keep it looking mean, and there are nothing meaner than skulls. They were very easy for my husband to install. They went right in and they hooked up perfectly to his bike. It didn't take him very long at all before he had working skull blinkers.They were bright and fun.

"These ice cube trays ROCK! Oh I love them, my kids love them, even my husband (who doesn't like anything) loves them. They are just really cool to start with. The ice cubes that they make are HUGE. You only need one ice cube per glass.What I really like (other than the fact it just looks interesting) is that it seems to melt slower, and make the drink cooler faster and longer. I think because of the size of the ice, that's why. I'm not sure but that's how it seems to work.The ice cube tray is silicone so it's very easy to get the ice out of the tray, and to clean the tray when it needs it.

"This is such a cool idea. I really appreciate the placement of the hooks themselves. When I first saw it, and thought, ""cool"", but was worried that once a coat was hung on it that you wouldn't be able to see anything. This is not true, the coat hook is just low enough, to not block the camera.The video from it was fairly decent, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I wish the camera had slightly better quality. Along with a slightly better battery. Motion detection is great, unless you have pets that like to be very active at night, so my battery only lasted about half way through the night and I have had to charge it every day.It was really easy to install and though it has the sticker adhesive holding it on, it's strong. my kids have put their winter clothes on the hook and it hasn't budged so that is amazing. It's really easy to take off as well. You just slide it off and it unhooks and you pull it off the wall. Great design there.

"This is a beautiful mask. One thing I was super happy about when I got it was that it isn't stiff. When I saw this, and fell in love, I thought it was one of the stiff lace masks that wrap around your head with a band. It is not, it's soft and flexible.It was super easy to put on. Just a few bobby pins along the edges and it was secure and it looks adorable. I can't wait for Halloween and to find an outfit to fit this mask.

"Oh these helped with bath time so much. I have an almost 2 year old who is starting to transition to the big boy tub and it's a little scary for him. So I have been looking for things that will help distract him that make bath time a little less terrifying.These are fun, squishy and a lot of fun for my little guy. They were very soft and after they were wet they would stick to the side of the tub. So we would say a letter then throw it against the side of the tub and count how long it would stick.

"What a very cute outfit. My son looks adorable in it. I love how easy it is to button up. That can sometimes be a challenge as he is really wiggly so I appreciate that it's a quick snap to get this closed up and he can be on his way running once again.The material is very soft and fits well for the most part, except the legs are a little short, so they look like capris on him rather than pants. The arms fit great and everything else fits just perfect, but the legs were short, which is why I put somewhat small, because everything else fit so nicely.Everything was great, (other than the leg size) there was one thing I wish they would change. i wish the fabric was just a touch thicker because the back is solid white and it's a tad sheer.

"This little camera is AWESOME! Oh my kids and I have been having so much fun with this camera. I have only used the belt clip accessory or just carried it (though my son is in the process of building a bike rams, so we will be using the helmet mount soon).I love the size of the camera. As you can see from the pictures it's small which is great and  it's very light weight. I  have put it on my belt multiple times on our walk and I forget it's there I can barely notice it.the quality of the video is great, I was super surpised by the clarity. It keeps up with all the action. I started using it to record my kids around the house as well just because it's so easy to use. It was very easy to charge and to get the data off the camera. (You do need a micro sd card so you will want to buy one before you  use this). I happen to have an extra one. I have had a lot of fun with the camera and so have my kids.

" 1:19 Mins First of all I really love that there are 2 of them, because my husband never remembers to bring in his cooler at night, so having two of these freeze packs makes my life so much easier. I love the color they are lime green and that really is just a great color.Other features that I really appreciate are how flat they are. They are probably about 1.5 inches thick. That is a great thickness to lay flat in my husbands cooler but still have a ton of space left over to put his lunch in, which is great because my husband eats a lot of food.They are pretty good sized, if you look at the video I have my hand over them for a comparison and they are a nice size. They keep my husbands lunch cold all day. There was a couple days that his cooler was still chilled in the morning. They work great and come with two so you can't get much better than that.

"My kids thought this was hilarious. It's basically a giant hamster water feeder for dogs (or cats, which I don't have). It was very easy to put together. There is a little dish to weigh it down that you fill with water and then screw to the base. This was a piece of cake. The rest just snaps together and it took me about 5 minutes to get it put together.I have 2 dogs a shepherd mix and a shit zhu mix. My shepherd will have nothing to do with this. Its also a little low for him so it's pretty understandable. My shitzhu has used it a few times. It is was a little tricky for him at first but he is figuring it out. This is not somthing they wanted to use right away.It's definitely something you have to train your dog to use which is why I gave it 4 stars, but I love the look of it and it's so much more fun than their water dishes they have now.

"After 9 years, my Canon $900  DR2050c finally gave out. Although I did take a look at the replacement, I was more attracted to the Fujitsu ScanSnap. After using it for a few weeks, I can attest this is an excellent unit.The flip cover is a nice touch to keep the unit protected from dust (when the flip cover is closed the scanner goes into sleep mode and when you flip the cover open it wakes up). The quick launch icon is cool. You can just right click and select simplex/duplex scan. The ScanSnap Organizer is free and has a more fresh look than Nuance PaperPort 14 (that cost $100) and has the Microsoft Office 2010 ribbon look and feel.

"Long slow build up of a story with bad guy being smart and lucky - getting closer and closer.  It was good but I kept thinking about Stephen Kings Rose Madder.

"Luc and his family are very likeable, but that doesnt mean the book will be good.  There was no chemistry for me.  Normally a DNF is 1 star for me, but I dont want to hurt the authors stats too much for something that might be more about personal preference, so I upped it to 2.  This might work better for other readers.  I read the first 87 pages and the last 2 chapters.Ava is a TV reporter doing a story on Luc a NY cop.  She has permission to ride along with him on the job for three weeks.  He doesnt want her there, and he doesnt want to be the focus of a story, but his boss demanded it.

"Brenda does many awful things to Agnes and others throughout the book.  Other bad guys are also doing bad things.  But nothing is provable so no cop does anything (or they dont look for evidence).  The purpose is to give Agnes setbacks and problems to solve.  Her responses and reactions are the best part of the story.  Agnes is free with her anger.  She hits and threatens with frying pans and meat forks.  But shes a really good person inside and does some very nice things for others, like a needy boy she takes in.Someone wants Agnes dead so her Uncle Joey sends hitman Shane to protect her.  Joey and other locals used to be or still are mob related.  A romance develops between Agnes and Shane.I was unhappy with lack of explanations.  At the end all of a sudden we hear that one bad guy is in jail, another bad guy left town but we dont know what happened to him, and money was found and split among so and so.  There were no explanations or evidence of things.  See example in Spoiler.  Also I did not understand things between the hitman and his boss.CAUTION SPOILERS:Brenda stabs someone.  Agnes appears and the victim grabs her clothes before he dies.  The cop arrives and believes Agnes killed him so he puts Agnes in jail.  At the end Brenda is put in jail but there was no logic or evidence for the cop to put Brenda in jail instead of Agnes.  Sure Brenda physically assaulted two people later, but that didnt prove she killed the earlier guy.I was also bothered about the money.  It was missing for many years.  All of a sudden it is split among people at the end.  The guy who had it or knew where it was never spent it over the past many years.  Why didnt he spend it?

"Sophia is going to have some unexpected and unusual magic abilities.  But we wont know about them until the second book.  There are a couple of hints in this book, but this book is mostly setting things up.  At times I was waiting for the plot to take off.At the end, someone attempts to murder Sophia but she gets away.  Story to be continued.  It wasnt a bad cliffhanger because some things were resolved.  But a lot was started and not resolved.  Two powerful characters could be Sophias enemies, we arent sure.  The story is more about fantasy and magic than romance, but there is some romance and a happy ending regarding the romance.Think Regency England in a Fantasy world.  A lot of titles and court intrigue.  Women are property to be married off.  They wear corsets.  Transportation is via horseback and portals.

"This review is a little different than normal because I am comparing this book to another book as a way to describe why I liked it - why this book worked.I love a strong smart heroine, but many authors do not do it well.  An example is A Bollywood Affair.  Heroine Mili is smart and perfect.  Hero has writers block but when hes around Mili he can write again.  He normally hates women who cry, but with Mili he loves her tears.  He does all kinds of things for her.Somebody Wonderful is very different and does it well.  Timona was kidnapped but fought the guys and got away.  She was then attacked by a gang of youths but saved by a cop coming by.  For her it was love at first sight.  She wants to marry him.  But what made this good was that he did not want her.  She was striving toward the goal of getting him to love her.  In Bollywood, they both were drawn to each other from the beginning and there was no goal for Mili to strive for.Timona was so open and honest in her desire for Mick that at one point he said Have you no pride?  Have you no shame?  And she was not bothered by this comment.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person.  Story length: 302 pages.

"I loved three other books by this author: Lightning, Intensity, and Watchers.  I was hoping this would be another gem, but no.Ive read 17 books by this author.  In six of them including this story, someone having no memory (or amnesia) is a major part of the plot.  Here Bibi does a ritual to erase her memory.  She did this before the story begins.  Now to solve the plot she must remember.  Halfway there, she learns something and immediately does the ritual.  Then she is frustrated because she cant remember and needs to know what she just erased to be able to continue solving the plot.A second thing I did not like is in Spoiler below.  Not enough development (or explanation) about characters and their motivations.  Things were illogical.I was disappointed with two endings: the main climax with Ashley Bell and what happened to the bad guy.  They felt incomplete.  I wanted more or a something different about Ashley Bell.The author frequently interrupted scenes which annoyed me.  For example characters are listening to a tape recording.  During the tape, twice the author stops the scene and switches to another character and place, then returns to the tape.  Another example: The author interrupts a conversation two or three times to jump to other scenes.  I would prefer scenes/chapters finish in logical places.  You dont need formulaic cliffhangers to get me to read the whole book.  Im going to read it anyway.  Interruptions just add negativity to the experience.CAUTION SPOILER:Most of the plot occurred in a something like a dream.  In this dream bad guys were after Bibi while she tried to solve a problem.  There was no logic for many things that happened - like strange noises and shadows that appeared and disappeared and characters doing unexplained things.  An important part of writing is character actions fitting motivations.  But here there were no motivations.  For example I didnt know why a cop and teacher threatened Bebe.  Apparently they were under the mind control influence of the bad guy.  And then there was no resolution about them because the dream ended.END SPOILER.I am grateful to NetGalley for providing me a copy to review.  I was hoping to like this.  The author is a wonderful writer.  But I felt he needed a better plot.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person.  Story length: 576 pages.  Swearing language: strong but not often used.  Sexual content: none.

"Nina and Simons are psychically gifted prisoners in a medical-testing-prison-facility.  Something happens giving them a chance to escape.  The story is mostly about their actions, but three characters from the previous book (Breaking Out: Part I) help them.  This was pretty good, but not as good as the first book.  Its a little longer than the first book, but still very short.  This book ends at 80% of the Kindle count, with excerpts from other books at the end.At the end of this story, one couple hurriedly says I love you to each other.  That came out of nowhere.  These stories do not have enough relationship development to get to that level.

"It got a little slow in the middle, but most was good and the end was cool.  I loved Roses intelligence and loyalty.  There is a little romantic relationship development, and a good romantic ending.Rose had been a prisoner in a Tecran star ship for three months.  Sazo is the artificial intelligence thinking system that runs the ship.  Sazo figures out a way to communicate with Rose and helps her escape.  He tells her how to free him from Tecran control which she does.  The two of them escape.  They are picked up by a Grih star ship.I loved the way Rose was as honest as she could be with Sazo and with Dav the Grih captain.  Sazo did not want Dav to know about him.  But Dav needed to know.

"You can divide the grill with larger meats on one half directly on the grill - and smaller pieces on the other half on the Mat.  I like that you can cut the Mat to size with a pair of scissors.  I used the Mat in three ways below.Chicken breast with olive oil mustard marinade.  When directly on the grill it has a steak-like flavor with grill marks.  On the Mat, it tastes more like it came from the oven - more liked baked chicken than grilled chicken.  It was still good.  It took a minute longer to cook than when directly on the grill.Salmon with olive oil chili sauce marinade.  When I sprayed olive oil on the Mat the marinade burned.  The marinated fish was better on the unsprayed Mat.  It tasted fine, but I will probably not use it for salmon in the future.  Im used to a metal fish holder which I wash after every use.  I felt a need to wash the Mat after every use so I could store it.  But if you keep it on or near the grill its probably ok just to give it a wipe with a cloth.I paid $4.99 to cover shipping, but I received this product at no charge in return for writing a review.

"1.  Almost all conflicts are exaggerations in the mind - like a see saw - ups and downs with no basis in fact.  Characters say things they dont mean and are silent when silence means the wrong thing.Examples:They smile at each other.  She then thinks Oh I cant let him think I like him so she insults him.  Then he is angry and does angry things.  Now she regrets insulting him but wont apologize.  She silently sulks.She asks for sex so he begins.  Then when she sees the condom she gets angsty and changes her mind.  A minute later she changes her mind back again.She says the words make love which causes him to freak out and he no longer wants sex.  Then a minute later he changes his mind, again.After one of the sex scenes, he thinks she just plans to f... me and then forget me.  That came out of nowhere.  It was made up in his head.All these thoughts were jarring - back and forth exaggerations in the mind.------------------------------------CAUTION SPOILERS: (items 2 and 3 re: stupidity)2.  Aiden is gathering evidence to give to the DA to put Morelli the mob boss in jail.  But he needs more evidence.  Ryanns father left some evidence for her with a friend.  Aiden and Ryann meet the friend to get it.  The friend gives a flash drive to Ryann but Aiden doesnt see it.  Then Ryann keeps it a secret for 10 hours, not telling Aiden she has it?  And now hes mad that she didnt show him the evidence right away?  That was why they went to meet the guy.Ryann knows Aiden is working with the DA.  Aiden meets with the DA at a strip club so the bad guys wont know what they are doing.  Aiden does not tell Ryann where he is going.  When she hears he is at a strip club, she thinks the worst, packs her bag and starts to leave town - without even asking him.  It was stupid of him to keep this a secret.  And stupid of her.3.  More heroine stupidity:  Aiden tells her not to go to his fights because she is in danger of being grabbed by Morelli and that will distract him.  So she goes to a fight.  Bad guy grabs her and holds her for Aiden to see.  Then Aiden gets hurt because he is now forced to do what the bad guy wants.  That really made me angry.END SPOILERS.--------------------------------------4.  Early in the book Ryann (a private investigator) is hired to find Aiden.  I wanted to see how Ryann discovered clues to find out where he was.  I was disappointed that was skipped, nothing was shown.  Instead, after being hired the next scene has Ryann talking to Aiden.5.  This was a minor problem but it bugged me.  I dont like authors giving female and male names to the opposite sex.  Throughout the book I had to concentrate to remember that Ryann was a girl.  Aiden is a little more generic but I kept thinking Aiden was the girl.  It didnt fit the tough fighter.WHAT WAS GOOD?I liked the character definitions and personalities and the good sexy chemistry between Ryann and Aiden.  I liked the plot and set up.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person.  Kindle count length: 5,350 (402 pages per Amazon).  Swearing language: strong including religious swear words.  Sexual language: strong.

"This is book 2 in the series.  I read Desperate (book 1) which is the back story before the three sisters became bounty hunters.  I was eager to read about their first attempt at bounty hunting in this book.  I wanted to see how they learned what to do, the mistakes they made, and how it worked out.  I was hoping to see feminine style hunting.  I was so disappointed to see that this book skipped a year and simply states that the sisters brought in twelve bounties during the past year.  It skipped the bounty hunting activities.  Wow.  That is not what I hoped for.So, what is this about?  Meg and Ruby catch Simon, but Zach the sheriff takes Simon away from them.  Then Meg follows Zach and takes Simon again.  Its mostly Meg and Zachs relationship, wanting each other and fighting each other  - with the bad guy Simon as a secondary story.  The relationship was fun to watch, but for some reason I skimmed a lot.  It didnt hold me the way a good book should.Zach was not logical in his actions regarding Simon.  That might be ok.  I dont require perfection.I did not like the big misunderstanding.  Zach should have told Meg something earlier.  When she found out she went nuclear.  It felt exaggerated to increase the conflict.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person.  Kindle count length: 3,239 (301 pages per Amazon).  Swearing language: moderate.  Sexual language: moderate.

"This novella (119 pages) introduces three sisters ages 15 to 19.  The mother died seven years earlier.  Their dad occasionally does bounty hunting to make ends meet and pay the yearly mortgage payment.  They live on family farm.  The dad dies.  The girls get jobs which dont turn out well.

She has a large dowry and asks Lovingdon to help her choose a husband from the many who are after her.CAUTION SPOILER:Early in the story we learn that Grace has scars.

"This is typical LM Rice with her alpha hero totally turned on by his sweet lovely heroine.  The plot was typical, but I had fun.  I didnt want to stop reading.  I had a smile on my face most of the time.Two minor problems.  The cover picture does not match the guy.  He has tattoos around his wrists, cover guy does not.  The second problem was a scene where someone unlatched a seat belt, but on the next page after the car rolled, she was hanging upside down by the seat belt.  I also did not like that the heroine gave almost all her money away - to scholarships for art students.  Too many authors do things like this to make us admire the heroine.  Its not smart.

"The story is told in 1st person from the viewpoint of Justice Drake.  He is angry and aloof.  I feel like he is condescending toward his women clients.  Im not sure what he is feeling.  Women come to his resort to learn how to please their rich husbands sexually.  I believe all or most of the husbands are getting sex outside of their marriages.When reading 1st person I identify with the narrator.  But there is a disconnect for me when the narrator is a man.  He talks about his feelings toward women and being turned on when looking at a woman.  So I have to spend energy keeping a certain mindset.The biggest problem was 1st person present tense.  I dont like any 1st person, but 1st person present is the worst.  Here are some examples from the book of 1st person present.I drain my beer before crossing the courtyard to my home...I swim the length of the pool...I see Allison bend down to sit at the edge of the pool...I turn to watch, amazed at the sight of the fragile gazelle at the watering hole.  (Pages 26 to 28)How much nicer this story would be if done in 3rd person past tense.  He drained his beer...He swam the length of the pool.  Some authors say their muse pulls them to write in 1st person or its easier to write in 1st person.  My response is do a draft in 1st person, then rewrite it in 3rd.  Its a skill to write in 3rd.

It was briefly mentioned later in the book but not enough details.  I wanted more background about the abuse from the father - what the father did and said to the mother, Phin, and Sterling.

Ana meets Sam who helps her.As happens with many 1st person books, most of the conflict and mystery is in the mind of Ana.  She doesnt know what Sam is thinking or what Sams friend is thinking.  Conversations are not clear.  Ana ponders and wonders instead of asking questions.  Sam does not answer clearly or explain.Parts were interesting, like when the sylphs attacked Ana.

"Good ideas.  Reminded me of a world similar to Harry Potter.  Various magical creatures live on earth and some of them enjoy hurting humans.  The main character is Gage.  At age 6 he was taken from his human parents to live and learn magic at a warlock school.  His mentor Simon was evil.  Gage ran away from school at age 16 to live among humans.  The warlocks reluctantly allowed this and said he could not use his magic except in self defense - or they would kill him.  The story begins a few years later with Gage and his friends Bronx and Trixie running a tattoo shop.  Tera comes to Gage asking for a tattoo of angel wings on her back.  Her picture is on the cover of the book, but she is a minor character - only a couple of scenes.  Things happening to and by Gage are the main event.The story is told in 1st person past tense in the head of Gage.  I am female and I was very uncomfortable when I (as Gage) was admiring the breasts of Trixie.  Then during sex I (as Gage) was feeling sexuality as she kissed me.  It was unsettling.  Maybe other female readers can compartmentalize or something better than I can.  But this one gave me an ick feeling.  (Lesbian readers: you might like this.)This book is done in 1st person.  Can you imagine the Harry Potter books being done in 1st person Harry Potter?  HP was much richer being done in 3rd.  And I think Angels Ink would have been better in 3rd.  We could get inside some of the other characters for a change.A few times it dragged.  In the beginning it was ok, but a few times I was annoyed.  Characters kept beating up Gage and used magic against him, but he couldnt fight back because the warlock council didnt want him using his magic.  It was too much helplessness.  He frequently broke the rules and used magic - like helping others.  But when the mafia had him tied up, he did not use magic and I wished he would have.THE SERIES:The Asylum Interviews: Bronx (The Asylum Tales #0.5)  87 pagesThe Asylum Interviews: Trixie (The Asylum Tales #0.6) 100 pagesAngels Ink (The Asylum Tales #1)  338 pagesDead Mans Deal (The Asylum Tales #2) 371 pagesAnother reviewer suggested reading the two novella prequels to this story.  I did not read them, and I think this story is ok as a stand alone.  But if you really like this book, then Id suggest you go back and read them.  Angels Ink has a good ending and felt complete.  Although there are some open things that will continue in the next book.CAUTION SPOILER - re stupidity:There are some important things that Gage must keep secret.

"This is the second book in the Wicked Lovely series.  The main characters are not together at the end, so its not a romance.  The ending was complete, not a cliffhanger.

Its not that I want a lot of gory detail, but that part was vaguely referred to.  I was frustrated because I wanted to know what the faeries did to humans.

"I just called Spare One, and spoke with Robin Ko at their Customer Service Dept.He confirmed that this Spare One cell phone is a ""G2"" Network device, and that the""G2"" Network will be disabled within about one year (by December fo 2016),rendering all of these Spare One Emergency Cell Phones USELESS and totallyUNABLE to place ANY call... which means UNABLE TO CALL 911.He said they were working to come out with a ""3G"" or ""4 G"" Network phone thatwould work into the foreseeable future.I asked him this:""How can you, in good conscience, continue to sell thousands of people theseEMERGENCY USE cell phones, providing 911 access for a claimed'15 years of reliability on one AA battery'when you KNOW these phones will be non-functioning junk by December of 2016?Don't you understand that people are trusting you with their LIVES, believingthey will be able to call 911 in a life-or-death situation, using your EmergencyCell Phone... and when that call cannot go through after Dec. of 2016...many of them may die?  How can you continue to sell this without disclaimingthat fact?""He said that he would pass the complaint along to the owners.Yeah.  Great.This is a class-action lawsuit waiting to happen.I love the idea behind this phone, and I am shocked that there are notmore companies producing a AA-Battery-Powered cell phone... foremergency use, or even for regular use.However... DO NOT buy this current ""G2"" model of Spare One cell phone.It will NOT work at all after December of 2016, when the nationwideold G2 Network is disabled, and only G3 and G4 cellular networks remain operational.Shame on this company for selling people an Emergency 911 phone that will not workas of 2017... and not disclaiming that fact anywhere. That's like selling someone a handgunfor personal protection, and knowing the gun will not work in several months, and not tellingthem that fact.  It's like selling someone parachute that is designed to not function,without warning, several months after they buy it... and they bet their life it will work.Amazon should take this item off its website... if not for moral reasons... at least for legalliability reasons.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3716OI2DAN1HG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6LNC1O#wasThisHelpful","R3716OI2DAN1HG","A1M6D4RPSG88JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M6D4RPSG88JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The instructions say to spray this onto the cutting head of you electric razorAFTER you have shaved, and washed the razor head clean... just before youput the electric razor away.  I followed those instructions precisely for overa year, and it certainly did keep the razor head nicely lubricated and fresh-smelling.A few months ago... I decided to try something different:I still clean the cutting head with liquid soap and water, and rinse it cleanafter each use, but I stopped spraying this ""Shaver Saver"" onto the cutting headjust prior to putting it away.  Instead... I now spray the ""Shaver Saver"" ontothe clean and dry moving blades of the cutting head JUST BEFORE I SHAVE.The result is much better.  So much so that I don't understand why the manufacturer'sdirections don't suggest this as the ideal method of use for the product.When you spray the ""Shaver Saver"" onto the blades just BEFORE you shave,you can hear the motorized cutting head get slightly higher-pitched indicating thatthe blade assembly is moving slightly faster, and the lubricant also noticeably helpsthe electric razor to glide smoothly over my face.So my advice is... disregard the instructions... but use the product... its works very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3851QGAWD3081/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8IZGEM#wasThisHelpful","R3851QGAWD3081","A1M6D4RPSG88JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M6D4RPSG88JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the best Triclosan-Free, Naturally Antibiotic Liquid Hand Soap on the market.An interesting story about how we came to discover this product...I recently purchased an expensive liquid soap pump dispenser and I was disappointed tosee that after just a couple of months, the pump mechanism had deteriorated andwas rendered inoperable.  I called the manufacturer to complain, and the rep asked me,""Are you using a liquid soap with TRICLOSAN in it, such as Liquid Dial?""I said ""Yes"".  She said, ""The Triclosan is eating-away at the plastic and metal in yoursoap pump, just as it eats away at your hands.  We get people calling about this all the time.Triclosan is also a cancer-causing agent. Don't use mass-market anti-bacterial soaps.We recommend E.O. Brand.  It will not destroy your pump... or your hands.""With that advice, she sent me a free replacement pump.I immediately purchased a sample of this E.O. brand Peppermint and Tea Tree Oilliquid soap, and after several months of use... everything is working fine.  It appears thatshe was right about the Triclosan in Liquid Dial eating away at the pump mechanism.What's really great about this E.O. brand Peppermint and Tea Tree Oil soap, is thecombination of tea tree oil... which is said to be an all-natural antibiotic with nocarcinogens, together with natural peppermint oil, which masks the otherwiseastringent smell of soaps which use only tea tree oil... resulting in a soap that providesall the natural germ-killing effectiveness of tea tree oil, but with the far more pleasant smellof peppermint.

"When you see a necklace and earring set for under $15 total, you may betempted to assume that the quality must surely be very low.  That would bevery wrong in this particular case.  Of course, these are not sterling silver,and the little stones are not diamonds or even high-end CZ's... but for under$15, I am just astonished at how nicely-made, highly-detailed, andperfectly-finished this necklace and earring set is.  It looks more like aset that should cost closer to $50 in my estimation.The very high level of tiny detail is complimented by an enamel finish ofrich cobalt blue and cherry red and bright silver and smooth white... all ofwhich stays within-the-lines very neatly.  The hand-applied enamel colorsare clearly done by someone who spends considerable time on each set.Yes...

"I always maintain a good supply of these disposable covers to use asfoot protection (not shoe protection) when going through airport security.I am just amazed at how every time we go through the TSA metal detector area,after following the required procedure of removing our shoes;my wife and I are consistently the ONLY people in sight who are unwilling to thenplace our bare feet (or socks-only feet, depending upon the season) directlyonto that CARPET where ten thousand other bare-footed (or sock-footed)people have just walked with their sweaty, athlete's-foot, toenail-fungus-laddenfeet upon that same carpet.  It is disgusting.  If even one percent of those peoplehave athlete's foot or other fungal infection (and I promise you it is much morethan one percent), then that carpet is just teeming with infectious pathogens.Do you honestly think that they shampoo or steam clean that carpet more thanonce every several days... at the most?  Of course not.  And would it even matterif they steam cleaned it earlier that same day?  No, it would not.Everyone seems blissfully unaware of this obvious reality.You don't have to be a germ-a-phobe fanatic to understand how outrageouslydisgusting and dangerous it is to place you un-shoed feet on an absorbentpublic carpet that many thousands of people have just walked across withtheir own un-shoed, and often infectious, feet.  It's just common sense.The last time I went through with my light-blue disposable ""booties"" on my feet,the TSA guy put his hand on my shoulder (they are very touch-oriented, you know),and told me that was the SMARTEST thing he had seen any traveler do all day,and he commented that he too could not believe that so very few people protect their feet.We wear them for about two minutes, and dispose of them.  It is the best 20 centsyou will ever spend when traveling by air... I promise you.  We would never dreamof going through airport security without a pair to wear when leaving, and pair to wearwhen returning home.That being said, regarding this specific product's quality ... I must add that thewhite ""treads"" on the bottom are just a image.  It looks like it was printed on it.There is no actual tread there... no grippy material... it's just a visual design, which issomewhat deceptive.Regarding their durability over time... I have no idea, and I don't care, because I've neverworn a pair more than two or three minutes.  Regarding their ability to fit over shoes... again,because I only wear them over my feet with no shoes... my size 10 feet fit in them with a LOT ofroom to spare. Bare feet (or socks-only feet) of almost any size will fit with room to spare.(And for what it's worth... yes, they will also fit over my size 10 shoes.)I strongly urge everyone to buy some of these for foot hygiene and foot protection every timeit is necessary to go through airport security.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A3T3KQBZX8A4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EP7J4Q#wasThisHelpful","R3A3T3KQBZX8A4","A1M6D4RPSG88JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M6D4RPSG88JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this Huntington Brass faucet for my under-the-counter-mounted reverse osmosiswater filtration system.  It is a high-quality and solid design which is fairly heavy for its size.This is a dramatic upgrade from the standard cheap and lightweight faucets that tend tocome with even an expensive water filtration system.It works very well, and provides a very strong stream of water which is actually greaterin stream diameter than you might think from looking at the diameter of the faucet.No visible part of this faucet is plastic... it is 100% a lovely metal finish.  The faucethandle is well-designed also, enabling you to adjust the intensity of the water stream,and also to let go of the faucet handle in a middle-intensity-stream position, and thehandle will stay put where it is, in the middle, rather than bouncing back to full-on or full-off.Most importantly for me; while nearly all the thin drinking water faucets of this varietyare usually 12 to 15 inches tall... this one is just 10.5 inches tall from the base to themaximum height of the curved top portion.  That keeps it hidden behind the backsplash-bar top area behind my kitchen sink, rather than sticking way up in the air above it,which would have looked quite odd in my kitchen.I noticed that many of the similar-looking solid metal high-end drinking water faucetsoffered for sale are priced absurdly higher than this one... many commanding$175 to $350.  That is simply not necessary when a faucet as first-rate as this oneis available at a small fraction of that price level.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK7EIXRFD4OJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L42RN9O#wasThisHelpful","RK7EIXRFD4OJU","A1M6D4RPSG88JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M6D4RPSG88JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is insightful and fun to read.  It is also a book that is easy to pick up and read a bit, and put itdown and come back later to pick up where you left off, because it is broken into many very short chapters,each of which contain a key idea.  It's hard to describe this book, because it is so unique in its approachto telling the reader ""how things ought to be"" concerning everything from civil planning and city layout,to floor-plans, to architectural design, to furnishing.  The author is very opinionated and does not shy awayfrom boldly telling you what is wrong with the physical constructs of our urban, suburban, and rural areas,and how all of that should be properly done in his imagined ideal world.In some ways, this book is like reading the professional diary of your crazy uncle who is constantly rantingabout what's wrong with the world, and how he thinks it should be set right.  However, after reading it fora while, you get the impression that the author is not really crazy, so much as he is a brilliant eccentricwhose experience and understanding is based on an extremely broad appreciation of how human beings chooseto craft their surroundings, and how we get it right, and how we get it wrong, and why.Be forewarned... you are not going to agree with everything the author says.I don't agree, for example, with his outlandish claim that living in a home that is more than four storiesabout the ground will eventually make you crazy, because I have loved living on the top floor of myhigh-rise condo for the past ten years.  I also don't agree with his idea that all kitchen cabinets shouldbe open shelves with no doors, because the doors just get in the way, hide what is contained therein,and are essential useless.  I must admit, however, that I love reading the author's insights on thingswith which I disagree with him, and I have to admit that even on such issues... he's got good points!Many times I find myself saying ""Almost, thou persuadest me.""To be fair, I actually do agree with the author's views regarding the vast majority of his observations,as they are all just good common-sense approaches, and I must admit they often leave me thinking""Yes, that's such a beautifully simple truth... why don't we always build it that way, or do it that way?""This book gives you the benefit of the sage wisdom of an author who is genuinely worth readingand considering.  Even though this book is decades-old, most of its observations are timeless.It's so hard to classify the book.  Is it a Western approach to Feng Shui ... without all the questionableEastern Spiritualism, and more of practical philosophy on how to best craft your environment?Or is it better described as foundational reading for everyone from a City Planner, to an Architect,to anyone building a house, to anyone one looking to make their home a more pleasant place?However you choose to classify it... this book is a unique, delightful treatise on how things shouldideally be in order for human beings to be more comfortable, productive, and happy in their surroundings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VSX93G1FVDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195019199#wasThisHelpful","R1VSX93G1FVDC","A1M6D4RPSG88JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M6D4RPSG88JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These sunglasses are absolutely not polarized at all.  The manufacturer's claim thatthey are polarized, is disproven by the polarization test card that they include withthese sunglasses.  When you use the provided test card, you immediately see that theyare, in fact, not polarized.  Why the manufacturer would make a point of including in thepackage with the sunglasses, the polarization test card that proves them to be liars,is an absurdity to me.  There is no excuse for kind of misrepresentation.Having said that, you may be wondering, why then did I give these sunglasses4 out of 5 stars?  It is because, other than the false claim of polarization, these areexcellent sunglasses.  The frames are metal, not plastic, and they feature a veryattractive and elegant ""twisty"" metal cable-like design in the middle.  They do nothave a cheap look or feel... they are high-quality, beautiful sunglasses.The lenses feature an interesting gradient design which starts at the top withwhat I would describe as a dark olive green (with just a hint of blue-gray)...transitioning smoothly to a much lighter amber-yellow at the bottom.This gradient color combination makes them well-suited for driving onovercast / partly-cloudy days, because the darker olive green at the topfilters out brighter daylight from above, while the much lighter amber-yellowat the bottom provides less tint so as to not excessively darken your viewof the road, or your view of the instrument panel on your dashboard.This gradient also provides a good approach to driving at twilight, andpossibly even at night in a well-lighted city environment, because thegradient gives you the ability to tilt your head downward to block theoccasional, and often high-beam, headlights from oncoming trafficby filtering it through the darker tint at the upper portion of the lenses...and tilt your head back up to then view the evening road with a lessdarkened view provided by the much lighter tint at the bottom.It should also be noted that these glasses come with a very nicehardshell case, and a soft fabric bag, and a cleaning cloth, and asmall screwdriver adjustment tool, and a visor clip for storage...and all of that comes in a well-made outer storage box.(And again... for some unknown reason, they inexplicably come witha polarization test card, which proves their polarization claims to be false).So while I am upset with them for false claims of polarization... I am soimpressed with everything else about these gradient sunglasses,from their uniquely elegant design, to their overall high quality,to all the extras they come with... that I still have to give them a""thumbs up"".I would say that slightly darker sunglasses that these would be moreideal for driving or beach-walking on a bright sunny day...and somewhat lighter ""yellow"" lenses might be more ideal fordriving late at night in areas that are not well-lighted, such as outin the country...but these glasses with their versatile gradient dark-to-light lensesare most ideally suited for overcast / cloudy daytime driving,twilight driving, and urban area / city nighttime driving.Of course, following my observations might necessitate keepingthree pair of sunglasses in your car... each pair ideally suited foreach of those three types of conditions: one dark, one light, andone gradient dark-to-light such as these.  If these were truly polarized,I might be tempted to just keep these in the car as a ""shoot for the middle""compromise for all driving conditions... but alas, they are not polarized.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28FW5BEC0I2J3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOR69UK#wasThisHelpful","R28FW5BEC0I2J3","A1M6D4RPSG88JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M6D4RPSG88JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When shopping for polarized sunglasses, you have basically three categories of product:1.) Super-Expensive Fashion Name Brands (such as Ray Ban, etc.) which cost $150 to $200 or more, and are truly polarized2.) Value-Priced Sunglasses (such as these Duco brand) which cost $25 to $50, and are truly polarized3.) Super-Cheap Sunglasses, usually all around $10, which are decent but almost never really polarized in spite of claims to be polarized.Your best value is the middle category, which usually gives you quality, without paying an exorbitant price premium toget some name brand, which requires you to contribute to their huge brand-advertising budgets and storefront shop rents.These Duco sunglasses even ship with a polarization test card which demonstrates beyond a doubt that these lenses arefully polarized.  The polarization pattern, which is not visible with the naked eye, pops out dark and clear with these lenses.Other cheaper lenses I have, which claim to be ""polarized"" are just very, very slightly polarized, as they make the test patternvery, very faintly visible at best. You get what you pay for.These Duco sunglasses also ship with a protective hardshell case, and a soft fabric case, and a screwdriver adjustment tool,and a carry-clip.

"The first thing I noticed about this Hopkins FloTool Super Funnel was the$144 price tag, which Amazon had generously (indeed, amazingly) reduceddown to just $4.  Wow.  That's 97% OFF, boys and girls.  Yeah!Yet another benefit of being an Amazon customer.As soon as it arrived, I eagerly opened the box, breathless in anticipation ofmy $144 ""Super Funnel"".  I wondered what special powers it might have thatset it apart from mere standard funnels and made it a ""super funnel"".I quickly discovered why this masterpiece of craftsmanship usually warrantsa $144 price tag.First of all, the black plastic from which it is made can only be described as""exquisite"". Like fine obsidian, or a black sapphire, its depth of color andhigh gloss are simply mesmerizing.  Not like that cheap European plastic...this plastic super funnel hails from none other than... The Orient.That's right, the exotic Far East is the origin of this elegant work of art.""Made In China"" is proudly proclaimed upon its sleek body, and one canonly imagine the generations of craftsmen in the fine Oriental funnel shopsbeaming with pride at the thought of their handiwork being appreciatedaround the globe.Beyond a superficial appreciation of its stunning good-looks, when you pickit up, the superb balance is immediately noticed.  It rolls smoothly from handto hand without any trace of a wobble or imperfection.  You can rest assured,this is no ""cone of uncertainty"" as the meteorologists say... this is the embodimentof a standard of excellent to which few funnel craftsmen ever aspire, let alone attain.Now, I know what you're thinking:  ""Yeah, yeah... but can it funnel liquids?""Oh sweet mercy... can it ever funnel liquids!  You name it... this thing can funnel it:water (yes...both hot and cold),milk (skim, 2%, whole, and even buttermilk),wines (red, white, blush, and also champagne),all manner of oils, from olive oil, to motor oil, to lamp oil, to aromatherapy oils,juices, carbonated beverages, as well as beers both pale and dark,vinegars ranging from plain white to apple cider to fine aged balsamic.And ... are you sitting down?... I kid you not, this thing even funnels... fine beach sand!Dude... that's not even a liquid!  Un-freaking-believable.It's like a funnel from some other dimension of reality... or maybe... from the future.And the cherry on the sundae... it's got a little tab at the topwith a hole in it, so you can hang it from a nail.(Obviously, you will want to display it on your wall when it is not in use).I would not hesitate to buy this funnel at the full M.S.R.P. of $144,but at this absurdly low price of $4... well, Amazon is just giving them away.I know what all my friends and family are getting for Christmas next year,and I suspect there will not be a dry eye to be seen when they opentheir gifts and see this masterpiece.Yep... this here is what they call ""a game changer""... a ""paradigm shift"".It won't be long until Apple starts pumping out a competing product,no doubt called the ""iFunnel"", and priced at $299.It you're smart... you'll jump all over this Hopkins Super Funnelbefore Amazon realizes the crazy mistake they've made in pricingthis treasure at four bucks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO7ODI7ICTLY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BO8YVM#wasThisHelpful","RO7ODI7ICTLY3","A1M6D4RPSG88JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M6D4RPSG88JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this ""quiet"" hair drier as a Christmas gift for my wife.She is very happy with it, and she say that it dries her hair just slightly slower thanher very loud previous hair drier, but the reduced noise is a very welcome improvement.This is not a ""silent"" nor a ""near silent"" hair drier.  Because drying hair is a function ofprimarily wind speed, and to a somewhat lesser extent, also heat; it is impossible tohave a hair drier that is nearly silent, and yet still dries hair in a reasonable amount of time.That' just physics... there is no way around that simple fact of reality.This hair drier is, in my estimation, about one-half the loudness of a standard 1,500 watthair drier... but make no mistake, cutting the decibels by 50% is still a huge reduction in noise.Particularly when you consider that the source of this noise is a device that held up closeto your head and your ears... every decibel of sound reduction is a precious and welcomereduction, providing a far more comfortable and pleasant hair-drying experience for my wife,(and a far less irritating experience for her husband who is trying to watch TV in the adjacent room.)We have also noticed that the pitch of the noise it does make is a lower and more pleasant noise,as opposed to the high-pitched shrill noise of a standard hair drier that is reminiscent of the leaf-blower that our landscape maintenance workers use (and they use ear plugs all day).As long as your expectations are reasonable, and you are not clinging to any fantasies abouta nearly-silent hair drier, you should be very pleased with this Centric Q Zone Quiet Hair Drier,and I am quite certain that you cannot find a quieter hair drier... at least... not one that can alsoactually dry your hair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K4E5RC0GBPGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040WHH64#wasThisHelpful","R3K4E5RC0GBPGX","A1M6D4RPSG88JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M6D4RPSG88JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the best gun cleaning patches I have ever seen.Most gun cleaning patches are made of thin regular cotton rags... much like a little piece of a white T-shirt.They are frayed on the ends, very thin, and not as absorbent as they ideally should be for gun-cleaning purposes.In contrast to that... these are ""100% cotton flannel"" so that have more of a ""Jersey Knit"" kind of feel to them.They are more absorbent because they are very slightly ""fuzzy"", though they do not pill or fray... they keep their integrity.This provides a bit more bulk to fill the gun barrel, so it picks up more debris on each pass through, and it will alsoholds more cleaner or oil, if you are using it for that purpose.  You may find that you don't need quite as big a pieceof these flannel patches, as you might otherwise need when using the cheaper, thinner, ""cotton T-shirt piece"" varietyof gun cleaning patch material.The significant difference in quality between these flannel patches, and typical cotton patches is immediatelynoticed when you pick up the package and squeeze a few patches with your hands, or touch the surface ofthese patches.  Once you have used these flannel patches... I don't think you will ever want to go back to themore common thin cotton variety of gun cleaning patches.Unless you are a professional gunsmith that goes through dozens of patches every day; the modest price differencebetween these top-quality flannel patches, and the cheaper thin cotton patches, really just amounts to pocket change.I also noticed that these patches are made in the USA.

"I am impressed with The Winchester Deluxe 68-Piece Gun Care Case.This kit contains a generous assortment of bronze brushes for14 different calibers (or narrow caliber ranges),and matching mops for those 14 different calibers, which include:the typical riffle and small handgun calibers:  .17, .204, .22, .243, .270/280, .30and the typical medium to large handgun calibers: .357 / .38 / 9mm, .40, .44 / .45,and the somewhat more unusual larger calibers: .50, .540as well as the popular shotgun calibers: .410, 12 gauge, and 20 gauge.Each of these 14 bronze brushes and matching 14 mops has their respectivecaliber stamped directly into the metal shaft tip for permanent identification(rather than being on a cheap sticker on the implement's plastic tube),and I think that is a sign of quality and care on the part of the manufacturer.You also get a 13-piece solid brass jag set, for precise matching ofany caliber ranging from .17 up to .50The included brass rods will accommodate both handguns and long guns(rifle or shotgun), and they seem sturdy enough for reasonable regular use.I certainly prefer these brass rods to the competitor's pull-through-string devices.There are also many other things included, such as a variety of utility brushesmade of bronze, and nylon, and stainless steel ... pick the right one for yourapplication, or your personal preference of gun-cleaning technique.150 cotton cleaning patches (50 each of 3 different sizes) are included,along with 4 different sizes of slot tips for those various patches.The only essential that is not included is the liquid gun maintenance agentsof your choice, which are typically: a Bore Cleaning Solvent and a Lubricating Oil.You can purchase a little 2 to 3 ounce bottle of each of these (such as Hoppe's, etc.),and there is room inside this Winchester Kit to put them in the accessory case provided.I don't fault Winchester for not including this, because the choice of brand ofliquid gun maintenance agents can be another arena of opinionated personalpreference, and each one only costs about $3 in the 2 to 3 ounce size,and again... there is ample extra room for two such small bottles in the case...so just add those two bottles, (and perhaps also add a nice cloth to wipeyour guns down with, and a small microfiber towel to put down on your work surface,and tuck those two things into your case as well... there is room for them) and you're done...you have everything you need.  Well, maybe put a bore flashlight in there, too.One humorous side note: the packaging boosts of a ""machined aluminum handle"",which is clearly a typographical error, as the carrying case is made of nylon,and there is no metal involved in the manufacturing of the case at all.I spent a couple hours researching all available options, and I wasmore impressed with this kit than any other kit on the market at anyprice up to twice as much as this one.There are many gun cleaning kits on the market, and every last one of them hasseveral people that have provided highly critical and negative product reviews,along with people who have provided glowingly positive reviews.  Rarely have Iseen any product with buyer's opinions so polarized to extremes of positive andnegative views of the same product... as I see with reviews of gun cleaning kits.One person says it is high-quality and perfectly designed, while another persondescribes it as cheap and flimsy and disappointing.  I'm not sure what it is exactlythat people are expecting from a gun cleaning kit that causes such disparity ofopinion in regard to what is essentially a simple and straightforward product.Hypothetically, yes, we could seek an over-the-top, ultra-high-gradegun cleaning kit for the professional gunsmith to use daily for many years.We can imagine such a fantasy kit, with titanium rods, and mops made of onlythe finest imported lamb's wool, and brushes with handles featuringinlaid exotic woods... mother-of-pearl, or perhaps even carbon fiber.Indeed, I think that it would take that level of awesome magnificence to get afive star review out of some of the most demanding reviewers out therewho seem perpetually displeased with every gun care kit on the market.Such a fantasy kit would, however, command an equally impressive price...and I'm not aware of such a kit existing at any price, outside of thecustom-made bespoke craftsman's workshop.For less than $60, this Winchester 68-piece gun care kit certainly offersa great deal of value for the price, and a very impressive range ofcaliber accommodation, all arranged in a neat, well-organized,well-crafted case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7CBIY90RZH54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DW0UVU#wasThisHelpful","R7CBIY90RZH54","A1M6D4RPSG88JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M6D4RPSG88JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years I have enjoyed, recommended, and even purchased as gifts for others,the doubled-walled drinking glasses and mugs of Ozeri's much older and morefamous primary competitor, the Swiss company, Bodum.My online research has revealed that both Ozeri and Bodum have their double-walleddrinking glasses manufactured in China ... regardless of where the companies have theirrespective executive headquarters located.  So both company's glasses are Chinese products.I have found the Ozeri double-walled drinking glasses to be of similar quality,similar weight, and similar fragility to their longstanding rival, Bodum.I must say that, I do prefer to Ozeri glasses for two reasons:1.) They are significantly less expensive than Bodum.2.) Ozeri's unique around-the-center indentation makes it much easier to grip and hold  the Ozeri glasses, providing a nice place to anchor one of your finger, so the glass  cannot slip out of your hand too easily.These Ozeri Serafino glasses are now my favorite go-to drinking glasses for daily use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KZRZMATWNWOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXC96UU#wasThisHelpful","R2KZRZMATWNWOX","A1M6D4RPSG88JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M6D4RPSG88JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Miracle Gro is owned by Scots, and since 1868 they have been selling gardening materials,with their current sales at nearly $3 Billion per year.  Their flagship product is ""Miracle-Gro""fertilizer... a bright blue granular compound that is mixed with water (making the water blue),and applied to plants, trees, shrubs, and lawns.  ""Miracle-Gro"" has become a household wordover the past few decades, and it continues to reign as the almost unchallenged King of Fertilizers.I have personally mixed up hundreds of 5-gallon buckets of this magical blue potion and poured itover many kinds of plants and trees, as well as lawns... with spectacular results.  It has been myexperience that a quality fertilizer in liquid form (as this becomes when you add water) is anorder of magnitude more effective than sprinkling ""slow-release"" granular solid fertilizers onthe surface and waiting for the rain to slowly wash them into the soil.I usually mix Miracle-Grow at about twice the recommended level of dilution, and still itnever burns or harms anything, and the result is quick and impressive levels of growth.Miracle-Gro is not generally used in large-scale commercial applications, because itwould be extremely cost-prohibitive and impractically time-consuming to use overseveral acres of property.  For the private home owner however, with a yard ofless than an acre or two; I do not believe there is any other product that is readilyavailable to the consumer and in large-scale production that will yield results superiorto Miracle-Gro.

"This is a great little Blu-Ray / DVD player, by a respected name-brand: LG.It has a small footprint (about the size of an average hardcover book).It provides excellent picture quality, and excellent sound quality.It is super-simple to connect and set-up, and very easy-to-use.Just add your Internet-Streaming Digital Media Player (Amazon Fire or Roku),on top of it, and you have two high-quality products that are each dedicatedto what they each do best... not packed together as a compromise-product.Here is the back-story:I used to have one of those all-in-one Blu-Ray AND WiFi Digital Streaming boxes from Sony.Like most of those all-in-one units, it had a needlessly complicated user interface,and in spite of being made by a highly respected manufacturer,its ability to actually connect to the Internet to stream digital content (like Netflix, etc.)was extremely poor-quality, and it crashed about 50% of the time, often totally unable to log-on at all.I dumped that, I bought Amazon Fire (a shockingly tiny box), with its powerful processor inside,and that thing connects to the Internet to stream Netflix and other services EVERY TIME without fail.I also have a Roku3, which is just as reliable.  That's what those devices were built to do.I don't know who decided that these two TOTALLY UNRELATED things:playing a Blu-Ray or DVD... and... Streaming Internet Media like Netflix,should be packaged together into a single product, spawning the""Smart Blu-Ray Player"" or 'Wi-Fi Streaming Blu-Ray Player"", but to me,that makes about as much sense as having asmart phone that is also an electric toothbrushor a Blu-Ray player that is also an alarm clock.  Bad idea.You are much better off buying a separate Internet Media Streaming Device thatspecializes in doing that one thing very well (the Amazon Fire TV with a powerfulcomputer processor inside is the best such device on the market, and the ROKU 3is a close second in its power and ability).When you do that, however, you may then need a Blu-Ray / DVD player...and it seems that about 95% of them have an unreliable, low-quality,(and if you followed my advice above... totally redundant and unneeded)WiFi Streaming Media capability built-in.This LG BP135 (and its similar model LG BP125) is a rarity because:it is JUST a Blue-Ray / DVD player ... it does not wirelessly stream other media,so it can focus on doing what it does in an excellent manner.It is so simple to connect:  the back side has only two things:the electrical plug, and one HDMI cable jack.  That's all.  And that's all you need.A child could hook this thing up in one minute without reading any instructions.Just plug it into the wall, and run an HDMI cable from this unit,to the HDMI jack on your TV... or to the HDMI jack on the backof your AV Receiver Unit on your home theater system.  That's it.  Done.You've now got a great little Blu-Ray / DVD Player ... and IF you also wanta high-quality, dedicated, WiFi Streaming Device, you can deal with that asa separate and unrelated issue, which is absolutely the best way to do that,at this point in time, given the products currently available to the consumer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PT70RYIOF088/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4TTQQK#wasThisHelpful","R1PT70RYIOF088","A1M6D4RPSG88JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M6D4RPSG88JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These OXO salt & pepper grinders are extremely well-designed, and high quality, and beautiful.Yes, they are pricey... but they are worth it.The grinder is on the top (brilliant!) unlike most other grinders with bottom-mounted mechanismsthat leave bits of salt & pepper all over the table when you set them down.  These therefore stayclean and neat after use.They are made of a silvery metal at both ends that is either stainless steel or aluminum, with athick transparent acrylic center column which looks and feels like glass, but is shatterproof.Also, the bottom is a dense black rubber that gives it a firm slip-resistant base, and protectswhatever tabletop surface it rests upon.Originally, I purchase from Amazon, a far more expensive and very similar-looking salt & papergrinder set made by Cole & Mason.  They brag that they have been making the finest grindersfor over a century in England... and I fell for it.  When they arrived, the packaging revealed thatCole & Mason now proudly outsource all their manufacturing to China.  Within just a few months,the grinder mechanism detached from the top, and no amount of super-glue could fix it.It's very sad to see a proud and ancient English company like Cole & Mason sell-out to China,and ruin their reputation by producing pretty, but low-grade, Chinese garbage at premium prices.These OXO grinders are a much better choice... and they also hold twice as much salt & pepperas the inferior, yet pricier, Cole & Mason grinders.  I recommend that you go with OXO.  I haveseveral other OXO brand products in my kitchen that I've had for many years, and they all stillwork, and they all still look brand-new.

"This is a very high-end, high-quality USB Cable, at a surprisingly... indeed shockingly... low price: under $10 at this time.Even at its full MSRP of $25... it would be a bargain.The gauge (thickness) of the wire is 24 AWG, which is a bit better than that of most other USB cablesthat are usually 26 or 28 AWG (remember: the LOWER the AWG number, the THICKER the wire).The ends are gold-plated for maximum preservation of transmission quality,rather than being the typical silvery-base-metal ends of lesser quality cables.The cable is also fully shielded and wrapped to prevent signal interference.It is manufactured at the maximum recommended length for a USB Cable:  5 meters (16.4 feet).This cable is perfect for connecting a home computer to a Digital Analog Converter, (D.A.C.), so you canplay your computer's digital music collection through your stereo components, at the highest possible quality level.(That's what I am doing with mine).

"The Shure SRH1440 Headphones are good headphones.They are not ""blow-you-away"" headphones that ""immerse you in an ocean of deep and rich sounds,leaving their competitors on the dust"", or other such superlative audiophile reviewer babble... no...but they are simply good, quality headphones.  I found them to be acceptable.  I am keeping them.Here is the back story:Earlier this week, I ordered and received the $180-more-expensive (nearly $500) Sennheiser HD 650headphones.  I was impressed by their almost unanimously great reviews.I found the Sennheiser HD 650 to be totally unacceptable for two reasons:1.) The HD 650 was very uncomfortable - like a tight vice grip on my head.2.) The HD 650 has a whopping 300 ohms of impedance, which to my surprise, I discovered wastoo much impedance / resistance even for my $250 TEAC model UD-H01 D.A.C. - Headphone Amp Unit tobe able to power them beyond just a moderate volume level.So, I returned the HD 650, and instead I ordered and received the Shure SRH1440 Headphones.They were much less expensive (at $300), and much more comfortable on my head,and because their impedance is only 37 ohms... which is about ONE-TENTH of the HD 650's 300 ohms...I was able to power them with my TEAC model UD-HO1 Digital-Analog-Converter - Headphone Amp Unit.The Shure SRH1440 headphones have very comfortable and soft velour cloth ear pads(a better choice than genuine or fake leather, as velour cloth breathes well against your skin).They are not too tight, not too loose, very flexible and adjustable... easy to fit to your head.They produce a nice balanced sound... not too full of bass... not too full of treble...(though if you have an old-school equalizer like I do, that is easily adjustable to suit your taste anyway).I did not like that the cord is only 2.1 meters (6.9 feet) long, as I could have ideally used justan extra foot or two... but I can make that work for me.  I did not like that the cord has a cheap,thin, rubber-coated, strangely ""bendy / bouncy"" quality to it, rather than being a cord that drapesdown more smoothly and uniformly, as it should.  That being said... it is a very lightweight cordthat does not tangle and does not weigh you down... and both ends are gold-plated... so it is acceptable to me.It is unexpected and generous of Shure that they also provide SRH1440s buyers with a second set of cords,and a second set of velour ear-pads... so you can swap-out your cords and ear pads in a few years,when your first sets gets old, and you then have the feel of a new set of headphones... that was thoughtful.You also get a semi-rigid carrying case.  You also get an adapter to convert the tiny 3.5 mm termination jack(which fits into an iPod / iPhone / iPad etc.) into a 1/4 inch classic big headphone jack such as thosefound on most home audio components, receivers, and headphone amps.In closing... I would like to point out one thing, on a related note, concerning what Ilearned this week about the required amplification of a good set of headphones:Although these Shure SRH1440 headphones, at just 37 ohms of impedance,are able to achieve a higher volume level than the Sennhesier HD 650's withtheir crazy-high 300 ohms of impedance... I still found that my new TEAC headphone ampwas only able to power these low-impedance Shure 1440s headphones to what I wouldcall a ""moderately loud"" listening level, if I turned the headphone amp's volume controlall the way up to 100%.  That's loud enough for me... but it might not quite be loud enoughfor some people.Apparently, in order to get really good (distortion free) somewhat high volume out of good headphones,you really need to buy a high-end, very powerful headphone amp, capable of delivering morepower than my $250 headphone amp / DAC combo unit is capable of delivering.I found that discovery to be very surprising.

"I needed a hose nozzle that was not the typical large ""gun"" type nozzle with a squeeze-trigger.Those large ""gun"" type nozzles are best for a hose that you use frequently and/or forextended periods of time... but my application was for a small and short hose on my balcony,which is used only once a month for a few minutes to clean off the balcony.  As such, I wantedthe most compact and least visually obtrusive design I could find.This Bullseye Power Nozzle is exactly what I needed.  It is ultra-compact, taking up almost no room...it is just like a little brass ""end cap"" on the tip of the hose.You can adjust the intensity of the spray from a wide mist to a narrow blast, simply by twisting the endclockwise or counter-clockwise.Also, this is a solid brass, thick, dense, heavy little thing for its size... excellent build quality...it feels like it will last for many years.  There are real steel ball-bearings on the twisting tip.This is not plastic junk... this is all metal.I am very impressed with its design, function, form, and overall appearance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAVRYVPLEUJ8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00144D8CI#wasThisHelpful","RAVRYVPLEUJ8V","A1M6D4RPSG88JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M6D4RPSG88JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These little hoses are not cheap... but this is an excellent example of ""you get what you pay for"", as they say.I went through a number of those ""expanding"" mini-hoses that shrink-up when not in use, and expand when in-use (as often seen on late-night TV commercials).  I tried more than one brand of that variety.  They all break within a few months... they start to leak.  That design... though seemingly cool... is far from being perfected, so I gave up on it.I decided to try this Water Right brand hose, and it is obviously of much higher quality.  This is a high-end small garden hose.  I've only used it for a few weeks, but it is of particularly impressive build quality, and it is much lighter and smaller than a full-size heavy garden hose.

"Normally, I prefer a ballpoint pen that lays down a nice thick line of a full 1.0 mm, or even 1.4 mm,for a bold and clear appearance.There are, however, instances in which I need to write with a very fine, very precise, very thin line of ink.For example:  when I am making appointment notes on my personal calendar, I need to be able to write asignificant amount of text in a small area.  For such applications... this pen is the ideal writing instrument.The ink dries instantly... no smudging / smearing, and the ink does not bleed out of the tip causing blotches.It lays down a micro-fine 0.3 mm line that is crisp, clean, and does not skip or blank-out when writing.You cannot buy 0.3 mm pens at your local office supply store... I have checked.  These are special-order pens,imported from Japan, and they have some Japanese writing on their barrel as well, indicating that they areapparently marketed primarily in Japan... and few are imported to the USA for sale.Yes... they are costly, but this is a surgically-precise, high-quality, ultra-fine writing instrument that isideally suited for applications where a maximum amount of text needs to fit clearly and neatly into aminimum amount of space.I understand why these pens have caps, and are not retractable.  It is because the cap makes anairtight-seal to keep the ink from drying-out... while retractable pens, though convenient, cannot do this.My only criticism of this pen's design would be that the cap does not have a clip on it, as nearly allink pens do.  Instead it strangely has what appears to be a tiny lanyard hole, for hanging thepen around your neck with a string.  I don't know who would do such a thing. Maybe that is aJapanese cultural thing.As a side note... I ordered one of these pens, and I was so pleased, that a couple weeks later, I ordered one more.To my surprise, they (accidentally?) sent me a whole box of ten (10) of these pens, for my intended order ofjust one more pen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU82MOZ04VNKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B46EZSC#wasThisHelpful","RU82MOZ04VNKP","A1M6D4RPSG88JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M6D4RPSG88JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Typical fabric ""oven mits"" have some serious limitations: - They burn and discolor easily - They are hard to wash - They offer no protection against boiling water - They limit dexterity because all fingers are pushed into one single segmentIn contrast, these no-frabric, all-silicone, grippy, five-finger oven gloves have many advantages: - They do not burn easily - They are super easy to wash - They protect your hands from a dip into boiling water - They offer superior dexterity and control, because you can use all fingers independently to grip thingsAdditionally, I like these because they are not as ""over-sized"" as many similar products.My wife has very small hands, and these gloves are not too big for her.I have average-size hands, and these gloves are just slightly snug, but not too tight.Unless you have very large hands (in which case these gloves would not fit you)... this is a good""compromise size"" that is small enough for most women's hands, and snug but still large enough for most men's hands.The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 stars, is because these gloves will not protect yourhands from dipping-and-holding your hand in boiling water for several seconds continuously...it will get uncomfortably hot if you try to use these gloves to reach down into boiling waterfor several seconds to move things around within the boiling pot.  These gloves should only be usedfor a very brief in-and-out adjustment of something in boiling water... no more than 2 seconds...and you will be fine.  (That's a lot better than fabric oven mits, which cannot be submerged intoboiling water at all).This product's limitations are few, and its advantages are numerous.

It is thicker than I would like, but I believe with time and practice one can achieve a light, gentle touch and thinner lines.On the other hand, the pink blush was pale to the point of translucency.

"""Friends - how many of us have them.Friends, ones we can depend on.""  -- Whodini, 1984This book made a Sarah Dessen convert out of me!  I love the book; the characters; the dialog; the dynamics and the story line.  Sarah Dessen is a genius, plain and simple.Sydney Stanford, 17 has lived in the shadow of her hell-raising older brother Peyton III her entire life.  Once having reached near adulthood, Peyton began making very bad decisions.  He had a career in petty crimes including drugs and theft.  After a stint in rehab in February 2014, Peyton visits friends and has a few too many.  When he heads home, he hits a 15-year-old boy on a bicycle, paralyzing him.This time Peyton has to face the music.  Instead of a slap on the wrist and a finger wagged in his face, he is sentenced to prison.  The story opens in the courtroom with the Stanfords and Peyton's creeper friend Ames.  Sydney, as always feeling invisible takes a bathroom break and there sees a blond girl with a knowing look.Knowing looks turn out to be the start of a series of interconnected events.  Sydney transfers to the local public high school as Peyton's life of petty crimes have had a severe negative impact on the family budget.  She is friendly with two girls, Jenn and Meredith and they maintain their friendship, although they see less of each other due to the transfer.Sydney, newly enrolled at the public high school enters a pizza shop called Seaside.  There she meets the blond girl she saw in court.  The girl, Layla Chatham is her age and also attends the school.  Layla's older sister Rosie, 19 and brother Mac, 18 help their father run the place.  Their mother has MS and Layla's family pull together and are there for each other.Sydney is so impressed by the loving bonds that tie Layla's family together.  The girls become fast friends and Sydney also has an eye for Mac.  Her friendship with this new family deepens and Layla's lovely mother takes Sydney under her wing.  Layla proves herself to be a real friend.  Rosie, like Peyton served a stint in rehab due to drinking and had a real sense of entitlement.  Layla, who ""never forgets a face"" and Sydney bond over a common concern as well.Sydney and the Chathams spend more time together and Sydney even helps out on pizza deliveries.  Mac teaches her how to read people psychologically based on what they order.  A very bright family, the Chatham children are also very musical.  Mac is in a band; Rosie and Layla sing and play guitar.Sydney's circle widens to include these new friends.  Despite some set backs, things finally fall into place for her.  Sydney even learns to defend herself to her very domineering mother who views life as plans and programs, even to the point of denying Sydney free time after Sydney lets her new friends use the family basement for band practice.I didn't like the way Sydney's mother kept pushing Ames, Peyton's sleazy friend on her.  Ames would offer to stay with Sydney when the Stanfords went to visit their son in jail.  Sydney was plainly afraid of him and tried to avoid him as much as humanly possible.  It is plain that as soon as he walks in through her door and tells her that his girlfriend couldn't come at the last minute that alarm bells and red flags went off in my mind.  DANGER!  Luckily Layla comes through like the Cavalry and stays in the house with Sydney, even blocking the bedroom door to protect them from Ames.  I also love the way Layla proved to be more musically talented than Ames.  When he tried to get the girls alone to show off his musical skills, Layla demonstrated hers and showed him up big time.  Classic!Sydney's mother was remarkably clueless.  For the longest time she just didn't get how dangerous and creepy Ames really was.  When Sydney, hoping to have a punishment commuted told her that ""things could go back to the way they are,"" meaning having extra study sessions instead of free time, her mother says that since Sydney is doing so well that ""it isn't that bad.""  Clueless!In time, Sydney rightfully regains her privileges and the Chathams teach her just what being a friend really means.  Fortunately, Sydney's mother after being so darn obtuse sees Ames for the creeper he really is, even to the point of danger.Reading this book is like watching a flower blossom.  Readers see the characters develop; unfold; change; evolve and the result is .... beautiful.I can't recommend this book highly enough.  I am already an avid fan of Sarah Dessen and will be reading her other books.  She is an author to watch for and take seriously.Whodini's 1984 rap ""Friends"" and the Beatles' 1967 classic ""I Get By With a Little Help From My Friends"" are the sound track of this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PZRJG9PH491W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451474708#wasThisHelpful","R1PZRJG9PH491W","AIEEK7AHXKZCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIEEK7AHXKZCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this product.  While I don't like the smell, that is a small price to pay considering what health benefits are contained in each pill.Turmeric is a potent anti-inflammitory that is often used to treat sore muscles and joint pains.  The pills themselves are quite potent and they do work.  If you exercise regularly and feel soreness in your muscles and joints, then you want this supplement.  For many who have joint issues and for many who have had surgery on their knees, this is the product for them.  It is recommended that you take one pill with each meal.Turmeric in any form has been touted as an excellent treatment for arthritis.  In addition, I have learned that turmeric is used for stomach and head pains as well as issues with the liver.  I learned from another U.S. reviewer that you can actually apply these pills to itching caused by rashes and bug bites.Thanks to Amazon, I have learned about Ubervita products.

"I am ambivalent about this book.  It is obvious that the characters down to their names and dynamics are updated versions of King Henry VIII (1491 -1547); Arthur Tudor (1486 - 1502); Anne Boleyn (1501 - 1536); Catherine [of] Aragon (1485 - 1536);  Jane Seymour (1508 - 1537) and other well-known key players during the Tudor Period in England.Instead of a royal court in England, we have a wealthy boy's mansion.  His ambitious parents, still reeling over the death of their perfect son Arthur have now anointed and appointed Henry heir apparent to their vast largesse as well as all their hopes and dreams and general aspirations.  The party, replete with masks on a stick hollers Middle Ages at you.  A girl named Catherine [of] Aragon, as in Henry VIII's first wife is all over Henry like a case of hives.And get this - Henry's parents push Catherine on him and want him to date and eventually marry people they approve of.  Henry's brother Arthur, dead throughout this book lingers like a bad smell as he is held up as the Platinum Standard and he was also the one who instituted the Kangaroo Court in their school.  Students can try each other and have a say on expelling anyone they feel has not reflected well on their school or met some academic or social standard.Enter Anne Boleyn, as in Henry's 3rd wife.  Ms Boleyn's literary millenial counterpart rides a motorcycle; breaks school rules at the fancy elitist school they attend and is rather fearless.  Anne's stepfather is an architect who is a well respected man about town.  That having been said, there are other parallels between Anne the Rebel and her Tudor counterpart.There is the usual adolescent angst and thinly veiled references to the real Tudors and members of their court.  The chapters are presented in point of view format, alternating between Henry and Anne with each giving their account of their relationship and life in their post-Tudor, 21st century community.  The writing of these characters impressed me as making a very strong effort to emphasize that they were versions of their real life Tudor counterparts.  King Henry VIII was a dick, sorry and Henry in this story is too.  He is not as crass or as boorish an oaf as the real King Henry VIII from all accounts, but he is still somewhat of a dick at times.And get this!  Henry  has a horse with the hideous name of Bacon.  I had a bit of a giggle when I thought of ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" by the Beatles.  The 1967 classic has this lyric:  ""Henry the Horse dances the waltz!""  I had a giggle envisioning Henry's horse dancing the waltz.  After all, in 1536 the real King Henry VIII was injured in a jousting incident while on horseback and his health and mobility were compromised for the remainder of his life.  I couldn't help but wonder if that was in store for this entitled Henry.I liked Anne.  She was smart and had spirit and appeared to be fearless.  True, she made bad judgment calls, but I felt she deserved far better than what she got.The best part of this book was the use of double entendre and other forms of word play that led readers directly to the Tudor Court during the times of Henry VIII.Yes, the writing was good.  Yes, the story kept my interest.  The reason I'm giving this a 2-star rating was that I so disliked Catherine as she was an inane cliche whereas her real counterpart was, as noted by another U.S. reviewer a genuine bad actor.  I was originally expecting her to be from Spain and readers would get treated to a multicultural array of characters, but was disappointed.  The real Catherine of Aragon was from Spain.  At the very least literary Catherine could have been a brunette.I also didn't care for the heavy handed way readers were banged over the head with the Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn ill fated union.  The real King and Queen ended up on a tragic note.  Anne Boleyn was the mother of Elizabeth I and was beheaded as she was not able to produce a son for the King.There is a kangaroo court in this book and sadly, Anne does lose her head, but in a way that might surprise readers.  Enter Jane Seymour.  Watch out future Anne Cleves, Catherine Howard (who might too be beheaded in a fashion in novels of this ilk) and Catherine Parr, who just might outlive this very entitled Henry.Overall, I thought this was just okay, but there were things that bothered me about this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3400XHWTIHE5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481439413#wasThisHelpful","R3400XHWTIHE5F","AIEEK7AHXKZCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIEEK7AHXKZCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is a good go-to resource when encountering an arcane or otherwise unfamiliar musical term.Unfortunately, this book does not have a section with English as the lead language into a non-English counterpart.  It falls short in that if you want to write any of your own musical works in another language (French, German, Italian) you might run into some stumbling blocks.

"As soon as I got this book, I could not tear myself away from it.  For years I have wanted to know Rosemary's story and am glad her turn at bat has been given its overdue notice.  I loved the book and found it brilliantly written and very well researched.  Larson, like Rosemary's Shriver relatives has given Rosemary's story a compassionate voice and one that will benefit the world at large.  Rosemary's life had meaning and purpose and it is in this book that readers are reminded of this as well.For decades Rosemary was eclipsed by her siblings and this was all the more glaringly apparent when her brother Jack was elected President in 1960 and Robert, then the Attorney General won the New York State Senate election in 1964 and youngest brother Ted won his senate seat in 1962.  Although her eight siblings are familiar to the public at large, Rosemary has until very recent times been relegated to the background or as Larson said relegated to the periphery of the Kennedy family dynamics.Readers get to ""know"" Rosemary on  her  own merits as well as within the context of her family.  Her parents' lives are chronicled in the first two chapters and Rose Kennedy's autobiography Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy:  Times to Remember is referenced later in the book.  It is in Larson's book that Rose had a ghostwriter working with her and was very reserved in what she did disclose about Rosemary.  Rosemary's fate in adult life is glaringly absent from her mother's memoir.Each of the Kennedy siblings is fully described and a part of this book.  The issues and political events of the times are included as background so that readers and historians gain a better understanding of the world as the Kennedys experienced during the 20th century.  With that background, she neatly segues into Rosemary's part in the family and Rosemary's life experiences in the ever-changing world in which she lived.Rosemary was born on Friday, September 13, 1918 during the height of the flu epidemic.  Rose, whose obstetrician was not available at the time Rosemary was about to be born held off on delivering her baby per her nurse's instructions.  The nurse pushed the baby back into the birth canal to stave off her impending arrival until the doctor could arrive.  In retrospect, trying to forestall the birth could have deprived Rosemary of much needed oxygen to her brain.  By virtue of the fact that Rose was instructed to clamp her legs together to keep the baby in place and did so for over two hours also raises the question of whether this prenatal to actual delivery time treatment impaired Rosemary's development.Joe Jr., 3 and Jack, 16 months were Rosemary's only older siblings.  One can't help but wonder how the two older boys interacted with their sister who, by their mother's descriptions was slow in reaching her developmental milestones including never mastering the ability to steer a sled or cut her own meat.  Rose and Joe Sr.  had issues in their own interactions which resulted in a short separation after Rosemary was born and prior to Kathleen's (""Kick,"" 1920-1948) arrival.Readers learn of Rosemary's school and travel trajectory.  She repeated kindergarten, which Rose Kennedy herself included in her autobiography.  By age 11 she was sent to the Devereaux School in Pennsylvania, the first famous alumna to attend.  Decades later Nancy Spungen (1958 - 1978) attended the school from 1970 - 1974, the only other well known student to have attended this branch of Devereaux.Rosemary could read, but never mastered reading above a 3rd grade level.  She wrote painstaking and laborious letters replete with misspellings.  Her childish penmanship remained a sore point with Joe Sr. to the point where, a decade later when he was an Ambassador to England, he would have her letters forwarded to an anonymous government pouch so as to prevent others from seeing her level of literacy.Rosemary's letters were newsy and chatty and certainly not those of someone severely limited.  She complained about the regular injections she received and the ""little red pills"" she took.  Other authors have identified the injections as hormone blockers to stave off her impending puberty and resultant mood swings.  As for the pills, the jury is still out on that one.  Larson speculated that the pills might have been allergy pills or possibly hormonally related.Throughout the 1930s, Rosemary would attend a total of 5 different boarding schools including a Catholic Convent school in Rhode Island.  At all times her family would try to cover for her, such as her sisters applying her lipstick and makeup for her and helping her get through meals without saying much and revealing her glaring naivete.  During Rosemary's young adulthood when her father was Ambassador to England, her brothers would dance with her, filling her dance card and discreetly encouraging their young friends to fill her dance card so as to encourage Rosemary to feel a part of things.  Rosemary had an abundance of enriching life experiences.  She traveled extensively; she and Rose and Kick were presented in Court before King George VI (Beatle George Harrison was named after him) and Queen Elizabeth.  Despite tripping upon presentation, Rosemary made a fine impression in Court.  Joe Kennedy, to his credit declared that only the wives and daughters of American diplomats could be presented in court.  This was the bird he flipped to those who had discriminated against him as a young man because he was Irish, Catholic and of humble economic origins.Rosemary apparently was happy in England.  By 1940 she was sent back to the United States where Rose led her to believe she would be ""a junior counsellor [sic],"" as Rosemary herself would say.  The camp was located in an idyllic part of western Massachusetts and run by the Sullivan Sisters.  The camp was for girls aged 7-16.  Rosemary, 22 was past camper age and was eager to go and try her wings.  Rose undoubtedly led her daughter to believe that she really would be a ""junior counsellor [sic]"" as Rosemary would write to family members.  During her time in England, Rosemary was given an ancillary role in a Montessori classroom run by nuns, one of whom had been trained by Maria Montessori herself and so saw herself in a leadership role.Sadly, Rosemary's time at the camp was short lived.  The Sullivan Sisters were furious with Rose because they didn't feel she leveled with them about the extent of Rosemary's limited social and cognitive skills.  Rosemary was described by others during this period as socially and emotionally on a par with 8-year-olds.  Rosemary's hygiene was another serious matter - instead of disposing her used monthly napkins discreetly, she stashed them in her footlocker.  The Sullivan Sisters knew Rosemary needed more help and supervision than they could give her.  Rosemary also would sneak out of their cabin at night, a matter of such grave concern that Caroline Sullivan would bar the door with her cot so that Rosemary could not wander outside at night.Rosemary's behavior, according to many sources became more erratic and unpredictable.  Some early sources claim she attacked her maternal grandfather in a fit of pique the summer of 1941.  While Larson does not make this claim, she uses reliable sources to describe Rosemary's understandable frustration at not being able to keep up to speed with her peers and siblings.  The explusion from the camp further hurt Rosemary's self confidence as her departure was expedited with Rosemary leaving behind many personal belongings.  The Sullivan Sisters described Rosemary's behavior as having an ""adverse affect"" on the younger campers.  They were irate when they received an unsigned check from Rose which they returned and waited several months to receive with a signature.  They also did not feel that Rose had much regard for Rosemary.It was during this time, 1940-1941 when the idea of lobotomizing Rosemary was first explored.  Joe Kennedy had his daughter Kick research the procedure and she returned with a grim pronouncement - lobotomies were generally not being recommended.  One doctor at a prominent hospital point blank refused to allow any psychiatric patients on his watch undergo this psychosurgical procedure due to the unknowns and adverse outcomes.  Many patients died from psychosurgery.His rationale for considering this dangerous option was that Rosemary, who had a tendency to sneak out at night might fall into bad company with men who did not mean her well.  He also felt that her behavior and glaring cognitive challenges reflected poorly on the family and he feared public embarrassment.  Somehow they were able to cover for Rosemary during his ambassadorship.  Once having returned home, it was a different story with Rosemary's rages becoming out of control.  Her sister Eunice bonded with her from the beginning and Eunice was often the one who could quell Rosemary's rages and smooth over uncomfortable scenes.Sadly, Rosemary was lobotomized in November of 1941.  Rose's knowledge of this procedure during this time remains sketchy and called into question.  It is known that Joe was determined to take this step as Rosemary was becoming uncontrollable.  Eunice as well as other authors described Rosemary has having incipient seizures.  At what point the seizures began is still under question.The lobotomy took away the gains Rosemary had made and left her completely dependent.  For seven years following the surgery, Rosemary was ensconced in Craig House, a private psychiatric facility for the rich in New York State.  Upon departure, she was transferred to St. Coletta's in Wisconsin, a place Joe Kennedy researched prior to having her transferred.  He provided for her, making sure she had a swimming pool courtesy of her trust fund,  a car for her caretakers to take her places as well as a private cottage called ""Kennedy Cottage.""  Rosemary remained at St. Coletta's until her death in 2005.Rosemary, as Larson says in this book made a difference.  She was cared for by kind nuns at St. Coletta's and did make periodic visits home over the years.  Eunice and her family as well as John and Caroline Kennedy would visit her and swim with her.  In 1961 President Kennedy disclosed that he had a sister with cognitive delays and pressed for legislation to make provisions for people with special needs.  Eunice Shriver started a camp for children with special needs at her home.  Her son Mark would later say he thought EVERYBODY had school busses full of kids coming to their homes to play every weekend.  By 1968 Camp Shriver had segued into Special Olympics.  Tim Shriver whose stellar book By Timothy Shriver Fully Alive: Discovering What Matters Most [Hardcover] describes Special Olympics and the Shriver family's spearheading this benevolent organization.  Good on the Shrivers!Eunice herself would say in 2007, just two years before her death that "" ...love gave me that confidence and adversity gave me purpose.""  The bond between those sisters remained intact; years after the surgery ""Eunice"" was one of the words Rosemary said.  The nuns who cared for her discovered her verbal ability was mostly intact once she was withdrawn from whichever medications she was taking in the early 1970s.The inclusion of previously unseen photographs and letters written by Rosemary herself made an excellent book even more so and a poignant one as well.  Each photograph made me wonder what Rosemary would have accomplished had she not been subjected to neurosurgery.Comparisons between health care and ethical standards over the decades are presented.  Prior to sending Rosemary to private schools with special 1x1 aides to meet her needs, most families floundered and had no known resources.  A large portion of the book in the latter chapters focuses on how the Kennedy family and Shriver family have spearheaded and brought an awareness of the needs for people with all special needs.  The Shrivers are especially recognized for their benevolent and philanthropic efforts and the changes their efforts have made to improve conditions in the lives of many with special needs and their families.For years I have wanted to learn Rosemary's story and how she saw herself.  This book answers many questions and will be a book I will never, repeat never forget.  Rosemary was fortunate in that she had a wealthy family who could provide for her needs to the point of luxurious accommodation, but at great cost to Rosemary herself.  I have prayed for her over the years and was glad that she was in the care of kind nuns who really loved her and had her interests at heart.Rosemary had a good work ethic as did all of her siblings.  She worked hard to secure the gains she made pre-and post surgery.  She worked to regain her mobility after the surgery.  She worked hard with the nuns hired to teach her.  This book deserves a place of  honor.Rosemary, this is for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PTOGSHXC0D7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547250258#wasThisHelpful","R1PTOGSHXC0D7O","AIEEK7AHXKZCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIEEK7AHXKZCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Diane Chanmberlain books are always shinies for me.  Whenever one of her books becomes available, my corvine instincts kick into high gear and I avidly swoop down on the book in question.  I loved this book and although it does, as other U.S. reviewers noted, bear a resemblance to ""The Silent Sister,"" another book about a woman with secrets on the run it is still an excellent book.In this book, we are introduced to Molly and her husband in 2014.  Molly, nearly 39 desperately wants to adopt a baby.  She loves her husband yet keeps a secret from him that could have devastating repercussions.  Molly told her husband that her mother died from breast cancer years before they met.  In an amazing demonstration of faith, he buys her story.  Since they are both attorneys living in the Digital Age, one would think he could do a little arm chair sleuthing or pursue legal angles to checking out her story.  Ironically, Molly practices family law.The pre-adoption investigations are very tension filled and hair raising.  Readers will hang onto every word and scenario, wanting to know how this will all play out.  Molly's story is interspersed with flashbacks to the summer of 1990 when she was then 14.  Readers are introduced to Molly's dad and to the dynamics involved.  1990 was a touchstone year for Molly and Diane Chamberlain made appropriate references to the pop culture of that era and the types of interests a girl Molly's age would have had then.The characters are plausible and sympathetic and again, Diane Chamberlain's books are always worth the wait.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KDI818HYW03V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250010748#wasThisHelpful","R3KDI818HYW03V","AIEEK7AHXKZCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIEEK7AHXKZCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this Slumberjack sleeping bag and it arrived just in time for a camping trip.  As others on the U.S. boards noted, you do need a pad under the sleeping bag to stay warm.  It is ideal for summer camping.  The padding is soft and will retain heat.However, as another U.S. reviewer noted, if you are planning to camp in the cold country or during the cold season you will want the 0 degree bag instead.

"This product comes in powder form which makes it easy to take.  It has a really nice fruit flavor that makes this spoonful of medicine go down in the most delightful way.I never liked pills and have trouble swallowing them, so anything that comes in liquid or powder form is a Godsend to me.

"On the plus side, this camera is extremely light and portable.  It also has wi-fi connections that are easy to use.  The only drawback is that you have to use two buttons to record.  You first hit the power button and wait until it emits a tone.  Once you hear that tone, then you hit the record button.  As others have noted, if this had one button to accomplish those functions, that would be even better still.

"There is no creature as beautiful or as majestic as a peregrine falcon.  This bird is the fastest bird in creation and can fly almost 70 miles per hour.  The bird can also do an aerial swoop at 200 miles per hour and has keen vision that allows it to see for several miles above ground.Falcons live above ground in cliffs and under bridges on the beams.  Urban falcons have been spotted in cities and their aeries have been found on the roofs of tall buildings.  The birds' migratory habits and nest building skills are covered in this book.These aerial hunters only hunt from the sky.  The bird has extremely sharp talons that have the ability to slice and sever small prey.  Its hooked or curved beak mark it as a hawk and it is the speediest raptor.  Readers are treated to pictures of falcons swooping down on their prey (they usually give a falconine screech/scream as they descend upon some hapless smaller animal or bird) and eating their kill.Falcons are a protected species.  DDT and other poisons have sadly depopulated and deprived many areas of this much needed bird.  Fortunately, the falcons are repopluating and are extremely intelligent birds.  They can be trained to help in airports and other places in need of security.  These watchbirds learn very quickly and many falcons have been featured in wildlife shows and demos.  The falcon like most raptors tends to be ""monogamous"" and mates for life with a single partner.I love the photographs and the rich supply of information this book has.  I can't recommend it highly enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMXR2F5A292R6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936087936#wasThisHelpful","RMXR2F5A292R6","AIEEK7AHXKZCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIEEK7AHXKZCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent made for TV movie about the inception of the Beatles from the viewpoint of John Lennon.  In John's life, he's loved them all.  John is the hub on which the movie turns.  Viewers gain insight into the influences that created and molded the then future Chief Beatle.Filming this movie in Liverpool made it all the more authentic.  Liverpool, a gritty seaport in the north of England is the birth place of the Beatles and has long since become synonymous with the fab quartet.  Viewers take a Magical Mystery Tour with John, who was raised by his maternal Aunt Mimi.  John's natural mother,  Julia lived in the area and had sporadic contact with John while John's father (""that Alf Lennon"" as the Stanley Sisters called him) was out of the picture for a good portion of John's life.Julia, the youngest of the Stanley Sisters was also musical and it is from Julia as well as John's paternal grandfather, another man named John Lennon who would bequeath musical talent to the Chief Beatle.  Julia taught John banjo when he was a child and John also got his first ""mouth organ"" (harmonica) as a boy.  He demonstrated musical prowess from a very early age.Fans will see places immortalized in Beatle classics such as Penny Lane and its famous Roundabout; Strawberry Fields; Quarrybank High and the art college where John met his first wife Cynthia.The pre-Fabs get good coverage.  The period of 1960 - 1962 when the Beatles made the scene in Hamburg is included as well as former bandmate Stuart Sutcliffe (1941 - 1962) who would remain in Germany; marry the pre-Fabs' friend Astrid Kircherr and tragically die in Germany in 1962.Pete Best, the poorly matched drummer for the group was sacked in 1962 and this is well addressed in the movie.  One can't help but feel sorry for Pete as he plainly was not a good fit or a good match for the group.  Beatles' manager Brian Epstein is given his place in the sun and the highlight of the movie was February 7, 1964 (Beatles' Day!) when the Beatles came to America!Fans will likely find the actors don't always resemble their true-life counterparts and for some this can be somewhat disconcerting.  That having been said, the cast in this  movie overcame that obstacle by delivering rock solid performances and convincing deliveries.As for the actors playing the roles of the other Beatles, only Daniel McGowan presents Paul McCartney in a convincing way.  He rightfully portrays his Beatle counterpart as brilliant and infused with unstoppable talent.  George, on the other hand was a background figure and he was not convincing in the movie.  Sadly, the actor who played George more or less gave a stilted performance which was disappointing.  He also looked not a darn thing like George.  Ringo is given a fairly plausible presentation in this movie.Even so, remember this is a made for TV movie.  It is really quite good all things considered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUF2Q2SNH0FK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005J75Z#wasThisHelpful","RUF2Q2SNH0FK3","AIEEK7AHXKZCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIEEK7AHXKZCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""God bless you.  You've got a lucky face.  The end.""  -- John Lennon, 1964This delightful documentary takes readers on an early bird Magical Mystery Tour (oops - that's not until 1967) with the Beatles on their meteoric rise to fame!  No doubt much of the material will be familiar to inveterate, rabid Beatlemaniacs, but even so it will always be a treat to watch.Fans will have a bit of a giggle seeing the Beatles spoof on the Bard in period piece costumes.  John was a riot in drag with that hideous stiff wig and George, in pajamas and a stocking cap ""sitting high on top of his wavy haired head"" was especially adorable.  (For fans who have read biographies of the Beatles, George's funny cap will remind them of how Louise Harrison said in an interview that when George was a teen he let his long wavy hair grow and he would leave with his school cap sitting high on top of his head and some outfit he had customized to his specific taste.)  Yes, the boys were adorable and lots of fun.

"This is an excellent game with a Beatles' theme.If you are an inveterate, life-time, hard-core Beatles' fan, you might find it hard to get people to play this with you as they will understandably think you have an unfair advantage. Hard-core fans will most likely know most if not all of the answers in the Beatle version of Trivial Pursuit. For those who know arcane bits of information such as what was on the flip side of each single and their release dates and what was painted on George Harrison's bungalow and where and when George Harrison wrote his very first song, quote the Beatles' movies in full and the dates the Beatles played in Boston and Denver, then you'll probably think this game is child's play!  Even so, I doubt you'll be disappointed as a) you get to talk about the Beatles and b) you can see non-fans and less enthusiastic fans beam as they acquire Beatle information. You get a Ticket to Ride Beatlemania and you will enjoy the ride! This game rocks!I just love this game and wish I could get others to be willing to play it with me. Fans, regardless of their level of expertise will learn a lot from this game and very hard-core fans will pick up the error in ""which book did John pull off the bookcase in ""Help!'""? Hint: The answer is a book John wrote, but the answer given in the game is not the correct book John authored.We added a rule while playing this game. Every time a movie trivia question comes up, the person who has to answer the question also has to sing the title song from the movie. If you want to have a fun, laid-back party, invite your Beatle fan (or in my case, Beatle tolerant) friends over, pop in an early Beatles' CD and learn about the Beatles!I give it a hearty yeah, yeah, yeah!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YHU3EQ20ZXUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004F22CJQ#wasThisHelpful","R2YHU3EQ20ZXUJ","AIEEK7AHXKZCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIEEK7AHXKZCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"P is for Peeling will take you around half an hour to read, this one revolves around a guy who thinks he's pretty much the greatest yet to be published writer in the world, and expects when he takes his book to a meet the publishers and agents convention that they will be fighting each other to sign him up.  He looks down his nose at horror, romance, self published authors and well everyone else really.  He knows this is the day that will change his life but he's got this really bad cough and is starting to itch in embarrassing places.  Still nothing will stop his destiny.The book is interesting in that Iain Rob Wright has obviously put some of himself or his career experiences into the other writers that are looked down upon by the main character.  A young attractive female has written a book that's plot is Animal Kingdom for example.  P is for Peeling isn't my favourite of all the short stories I've read by Iain Rob Wright, but it is definitely one all fans of the author's work should check out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NS3RTOUTAWPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017PH5QDG#wasThisHelpful","R2NS3RTOUTAWPE","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Godzilla is a nice entry to the Funko Figures world, he's a bit taller than your standard Funko Pop Vinyl, if you've already got Stay Puft he's the same height as him without the hat.  Like Stay Puft he is not to the same high rise scale bigger as the one in the movie compared to the human Funko Vinyls and he couldn't really step on them. If you keep your Funko Figures in their boxes, the box is the same height as The Marshmallow Man.  The box is great packaging that I really wish other figure manufacturers would learn from. You can open the box, slide out the blister and remove the figure without damaging the box at all. There isn't even any tape or anything to cut. Then you can put the figure back inside if you decide to display it that way. The back of the box has a movie still of Godzilla chomping on a train, as does the side image with the cartoon drawing of the the reptile. You can view the figure from the front and one side of the box through the clear window. The boxes stack well on top of each other too, that's why it's great you can change your mind at how you want to display these Funkos.The only downside to the packaging is that you've got no idea if someone has opened it before you buy. As more and more people are becoming aware of the paint blemish factor, you seem to see more and more people opening these Funkos up in stores. If you're unaware it's a pretty rare occurrence to obtain a blemish free Funko figure, there's always a stray bit of paint somewhere on the figure, often on the back so even if you pick up a box in a store and the figure looks paint free, you won't know. Hence the reason customers are opening them up, or asking the online seller to do so and take photos for them to look at before purchasing. My Godzilla has small bits of white paint on it, it's not that big a deal for Godzilla as I imagine he gets bits of cement on him as he smashes through Tokyo city buildings.You can't pose his arms or move his legs, tail or anything, like the smaller Funkos he's set in the one stance.  What lets this figure down though is that you can't rotate his head at all, even though you can see where the head joins on, there is a back spike stopping his head from moving. If they weren't going to allow head movement, why not have made the whole reptile the same mold so then you wouldn't see the visible lines.  He is a fair bit darker a grey than the prototype image displayed on this page, and his red gums are more prominent.  He kind of looks like he's wearing lipstick.I think the prototype looks better but the final version still looks pretty good. I especially like his white claws on his feet and hands.  He stands no problem at all as he has pretty huge feet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22M2VTHU7T93Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014V9I18I#wasThisHelpful","R22M2VTHU7T93Y","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1992 released movie about a teen who gets pregnant while behind bars in juvie, and who is bullied and tricked to give up her baby.  She is told when he reaches 18, if he wants to he can track her down.  He doesn't so she decides to try and find him only to find out that he died at the age of three.  When she visits his grave with her other kids they run into an old man who criticises the demonization by people at the time of the foster mother who he is a relative of.  She investigates his death and doesn't believe the official reports that he died of non murder causes and hassles the police, talks the media and does whatever it takes to get justice for her son.I saw this one TV and when it started assumed this was a really old movie when Beverly D'Angelo appears on the screen as a teen prisoner.  I thought well this is obviously an earlier than the Vacation movies made film so was surprised when the film moved onto nineteen years or something into the future and D'Angelo is still playing the same now older character.  So for a low budget likely made for TV movie, they did a good job with the makeup, costume department and whatever to make her believable as a teen.  They also did a great job with the casting of the villain, the foster mother Lois Jurgens who is played by Dana Ivey.  I must admit I've never heard of her but she does a brilliant job as the evil woman, they should have cast her in the Carrie movie.  You despise her and that's means she's done a great job.I was also surprised to find out after the movie finished when I looked it up that this movie was based on a true story.  The movie doesn't do one of those sum everything up in a few text blurbs of what happened to the characters afterwards like most based on true crime events do.  If you read about the real Jurgens, you'll see that actually left quite a bit out about her.  Pure evil wouldn't describe her accurately.Obviously the movie deals with child abuse so may be a bit much for some people to watch but it's mostly the psychological that we the viewer see, with the sound of hitting in the background or the child crying.  The child actor does a very good job too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PHFO3B9LSDAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TMD7ZE#wasThisHelpful","R1PHFO3B9LSDAB","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Flood might be a title that immediately gives you the impression this might be a take on the Noah story, but there's not really a flood in the book. A lot of the east coast of North and South America was flooded by a huge tidal wave but Tsunami or Ship would have given a more accurate picture title. We don't really ever experience that flooded world anyway. If you feared a preachy book based on the title, rest assured this is not one of those, there is a minor amount of pages religious character who starts a cult and a few characters pray, but you'd expect the latter in any huge disaster tale, just due to the variety of people that make up our society, so omitting that completely wouldn't be that realistic.  Basically Flood is the tale of a group of New Yorkers who are evacuated from probable death with the approaching wave by being herded onto a cruise ship which has been directed to be part of the rescue that heads out to sea to go over the wave while it is a small bump and await directions on where to dock to disburse the refugees before returning on it's cruise with the original passengers.  At first the trip seems great, the captain in generous with the passengers', food and the cruise ship seems like a comfortable way to bypass the danger compared to the hulls of the freighters and other ships the other fleeing New Yorkers were herded onto.  However the ship is seen as a target by opportunists who have been wishing an event like this would occur.  The aftermath of their actions will test  the selfishness verse community survival aspects of everyone left alive on the ship.  Can they function as a society or like any apocalyptic world story, do you have more to fear from the survivors, than the disaster event itself?There are a lot of characters in this book but up until the end it never really became slightly confusing as to who was who.  I liked the novel, it kind of reminded me of the writing style of authors like Iain Rob Wright. The Kindle version has a bonus short story at the end that isn't related to Flood's storyline, that is told through both a guy who wakes up and realises he's tied up in the boot (trunk) of a car, and the guy driving the car.  I really liked the short story Locked in the Trunk of a Car.  I'd read other books by this author both set in the same Tsunami aftermath world  or about something else.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R309BP734Y8ENM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKOCF8W#wasThisHelpful","R309BP734Y8ENM","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This documentary is called Nightmare but it's more about people lying in their bed (sometimes asleep, sometimes not) who feel pins and needles in their limbs, can't move them, then are visited by shadow looking figures, sometimes one is wearing a hat, the one wearing the hat is bad.  I couldn't help but think when each of the, I think it is six people recount their bed tales, which is then played out and relived for the viewer on the screen by some pretty bad actors, that perhaps these people were drugged and abused, rather than it being some sort of nightmare or supernatural event.One guy can remember something that  happened when he was one and a half years old, so basically they let anyone with a story to tell contribute to this at the expense of screening them and omitting stuff that obviously isn't likely to have happened.  It's not just black shadow men, there's a blue man and a cat with red eyes too.Overall the appearance of the documentary is like those cheaply made true crime shows in the 90's. Not very well researched and bad acting can still be very watchable and entertaining if done properly, but this is no 1000 Ways to Die.  This was extremely boring and really could have simply been called When the Aliens Came and Visited Me in My Bedroom, and that's what you would have assumed it was about if it wasn't titled Nightmares.

"Hollywood has always had older actors, especially female actors playing younger aged teens so it's no surprise that they didn't find an actress  around 40 to play Jackie, a career woman about to reach that milestone and instead went with Heather Locklear.  Why they didn't just call the film Flirty With Fifty is anyone's guess.  Jackie's friend can't use her ticket to Hawaii so persuades the I don't have time to take a break from my work mother to spend her birthday in Hawaii where she can also forget about the fact her ex has the kids and a girlfriend in her twenties.  Jackie is saved from a sleazy dude at the pool by a surfing instructor (Robert Buckley) who pretends she's late for a lesson.  Of course she pretty much decides to have a lesson and later do some cougaring.  The two couldn't have more different outlooks on life, he's invented some sort of biodegrade surf wax but doesn't want to leave his laid back lifestyle to make the product a success and she can't resist answering her phone at any time of night or day for a needy client.  Neither really wants to change where they live or their outlook on life.The movie doesn't really reach any great writing heights, there's no twists in the plot or anything that happens by the end that you didn't expect would.  The ex husband is a bit of a jerk and hypocrite as you'd expect in this sort of movie.  The younger guy probably a bit too faultless to be believable, likewise her two kids who are little too happy and supportive all the time to pass as real kids, especially with the father behaving like he does.  There's plenty of swimsuit shots of both lead actors, a few hotel and other places bedroom scenes and pretty much everything else you'd expect with this sort of movie.  It's forgettable but has enough for most similar age to the father or mother character audiences that they might fantasize about being in that type of relationship themselves.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GKAM646RO6NV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TKNWVO#wasThisHelpful","R2GKAM646RO6NV","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bank Job is based on the true story of the Lloyds Baker Street bank robbery, with the conspiracy theories of the time thrown in such as the British Intelligence involvement and photos.  The urban legend stuff of course makes this a much more interesting storyline than it would have been as the simple dig a tunnel while being overheard by the ham radio enthusiast basic vault robbery tale.

Plus the openness of discussing what they're doing over the walkie talkies seemed to be a particularly strong level of stupidity but we know that, that actually happened.

She however has stopped taking her meds which had previously helped with dealing with the aftermath of the accident, and is starting to experience visions, objects flying around the room, noises such as the door banging, wine bottles exploding, and sees a guy in a hoodie.  All these things disappear as soon as she summons David. She is also convinced the guy next door is a meth cook. David is getting increasingly frustrated by her paranoia and embarrassing  escalating behaviour.  He wants her doctor (Jim Parsons, Big Bang Theory), to put her back on her meds for her own safety.  Her friend from pregnant yoga (Gillian Jacobs, Community), tells her not to give in to her husband's wants, it's her body etc.  As the terror gets worse for Eveleigh she wants David to abandon the new place, of course he doesn't want to.  Will they survive?This is your standard plot for the most part for this type of set up. Isla Fisher is the main actor in this one, the film revolves around her and she does a pretty good job. The other actors, including Anson Mount, don't have that many scenes.  If you're buying this because you're a fan of one of them, you may be disappointed that they simply don't have that much screen time.  If however you just want a good movie, this isn't a bad one, and the ending is a nice surprise that makes the film even more enjoyable so I won't give that away for you.  With so many actors who are the main character from TV shows in the minor roles the movie became more of a he's from this show, she's from that show game.  It was also obvious that those actors made this when actively shooting their TV shows, or close enough to it as they all still had the same haircuts and looked the way they do on those shows.  So you're kind of waiting for David to mention he's got to go build the railroad, Sadie to mention she's got to do something at Greendale and the doctor to mention to Eveleigh that she is sitting in his spot. Even Eva Longoria seems like she is just visiting and has to get back to her house on Desperate Housewives, although obviously that show has been over for a while.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XCHM9J3MNY48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011KME7QE#wasThisHelpful","R1XCHM9J3MNY48","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's an okay girl does something stupid that ruins another man's life who tries to make it right film, (that something stupid was killing his family as she was looking at another planet leaning out the open window of her car while driving).  Obviously jail and time has changed her from the person she was before the killing and this is an okay version of that often told story.  But what I think most people are buying this for is the fact there is another Earth and watching the unique stuff the plot could provide with that.  But other than some Australian tycoon offering a seat on his rocket to visit the new planet, and a moon landing type significant TV moment where a woman makes contact with someone on that planet, that's about it as far as that interesting topic angle goes.  That to me is ultimately, pretty disappointing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R374Q7KKQPJ5UQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00518JDWW#wasThisHelpful","R374Q7KKQPJ5UQ","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Trust No One is a lot different to Paul Cleave's other books, but other than the Cleaner, I'd say it is the book with the most fun thrown in, in with people getting killed and stuff that is.  I've read a few similar scenario books where the narrator doesn't know if they are the murderer, even a series by Mike Befeler's which starts with Retirement Homes Are Murder has a man waking up with no recent memories each day but who the police believe is a murderer. Those books though are a lot lighter though than Trust No One. Cleave's entry into this world is a good one.  In his the main character used to be a successful author  but was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease at age 49.  Now Jerry wakes in a nursing home bedroom, sometimes thinking he's on a book signing tour and he's in an unknown motel, sometimes thinking he is a murderer and that the events on the pages of his novels were his real life.  As you start to turn the pages of his current life as well as read flashback's to his earlier diagnosis days through the pages of his Madness Journal he wrote to his future self which interrupt the story, both you and Jerry began to realise it is perfectly plausible that he is somehow sneaking out of the nursing home and killing innocent women, then forgetting about it.The flashbacks and forth to the current Jerry's mind for the most part read pretty smoothly, except when we're going from the Madness Journal to a current diary.  But you can still follow it all times.  I did find the overall what was going on to be a bit more predictable than you would ideally like with this type of novel but it was still a great journey getting to the final pages.  The scariest part of the book isn't actually the serial killer aspect but the insight into the life of someone recording their mind's slip from their everyday person, they and everyone else recognise as them, to the days when the disease has taken almost over, and the paranoia and inability to remember as well as distinguish between false and true memories takes over.  It's scary because there's no way of knowing if it will happen to you, and if it does no way to stop it, at least for now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NWVTGKJ3NBIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476779171#wasThisHelpful","R1NWVTGKJ3NBIL","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had seen these in stores for a few months now but always thought they were overpriced for what they were, so when this became an add on item and only cost a couple of bucks, I decided to throw it in the cart with other figures I was buying.  This is worth a couple of dollars but not any more than that.  First of all, for a product with such a high retail price, it comes in a cheap to produce blister on cardboard type of packaging.  This means you've got to make a decision, do you display it in the packaging, or destroy the packaging and display it (or play with it).  You can't change your mind later.  Compare this to cheaper Funko Vinyl Figures which the figure itself is around the same size and come in a box you can open, take the figure out, then put it back later, and you can't tell at all.  The blister card also takes up a lot of room as it is quite oversized compared to the figure so if you do keep it in the blister to display, you're limited to where you can put it due to how tall it is. Also means if you're buying it online the seller needs a bigger box that will cost more and weigh more. The blister card also is pretty average looking, it doesn't really enhance the display by keeping it in there.  It is also isn't the easiest to get the figure out, you've got to cut plastic ties, which are clear and get lost, which wouldn't be good if you had an infant that likes eating stuff it finds on the floor, as they are hard to find.The figure itself looks fairly good from the front.  It heavy but fragile.  It wouldn't survive much rough play.  It comes with a bat on a long plastic strip which you inset into a hole at the back of its coat that comes out the front around where the minon's appendix would be. When you pull the bat out the arms and eyeball move, as do the teeth and some wheels underneath.  If you ever owned a car with the same sort of insert and pull plastic thing or even ones you revved up by pulling them back and back and then letting go, this is the same concept.  It makes that same loud sound too.  The minion however doesn't move very well.  It doesn't roll at all on carpet and on a hard smooth surface about it rolls about ten centimetres before falling over.  You can also move the arms and eyeball simply by rolling the wheels with your hand.  So really it's more of a display piece.From behind it doesn't look that great you can see all the screws holding it together.  It's plastic but hollow (except for the motor) so would likely smash if knocked off a shelf or desk onto the hard floor.  The motor inside isn't obviously that secure as it rattles when you move or shake the minion. For me this is simply a cheaply made figure that I'm not really likely to ever use as a toy simply because it doesn't really work as one.  As a figure you've got to compare it to other brand minions, including even the same character as Dracula's minion.  I think they are better value and more durable.  If this comes up here again for a couple of dollars or you can get it somewhere else really cheap give it a go, otherwise there's better minions figures out there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUAQ6Q409TY7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDMJCX6#wasThisHelpful","RUAQ6Q409TY7T","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is a teen rom com but don't be put off by that.  The two main characters are very likable and interesting, you do know where the story with the film's title and the fact rom coms all follow the same storyline will go, but the conversations between the two characters, as well as with their friends are interesting and enjoyable to watch.  If you were a teen watching this you might think it to be a bit unbelievable that a good looking girl like Britt Robertson's character with plenty of options would date a total jerk like her older boyfriend, but unfortunately those of us who are a bit older will tell you we've witnessed and baffled by that occurring in real life time and time again.Her parents probably weren't too realistic either that or were just incredibly stupid, plus you can't imagine they wouldn't here her talking to him on the roof or on the grass, or when she'd just closed the front door.  I mean I can hear conversations out front of my house.  Both lead actors Robertson and O'Brien do a great job though, as do the minor characters which include Victoria Justice from Victorious.  Even the guy who played Ronny did a good job, I mean you didn't like his character, that's how you were supposed to feel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33JK8B4XKGLTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AU2AZOO#wasThisHelpful","R33JK8B4XKGLTA","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The American DVD cover certainly gives the impression this is a more Hollywood gore type zombie film than the Australian version (country where film was made) does, which simply has a woman alone in a field.  Plague is set in a post virus outbreak world, where infected types roam around the place, although we the reviewer don't see many of them throughout most of the film.  They are different to your Hollywood norm zombies as well, in the fact that they can move fast, and can in fact run down humans.  They also don't mindlessly just wait around at a building when humans are inside, they'll just bang on the door for a while and then run off somewhere else.  I'm not to sure that run away part makes sense when there isn't a lot of prey around for them, surely they would wait but perhaps the dead don't have the best memory or attention span or whatever, we don't really learn much about them since this is a survivors' tale.I agree with other reviewers who state there isn't much original with this tale.  If you've seen an old Nicole Kidman film called Dead Calm, this is pretty much a remake of that, just instead of being on a yacht in the middle of the ocean and encountering another person, this film is set on an isolated farm's shed. It is a survival film.  Plague isn't helped by the fact the male of the couple isn't very likable at all, you don't really understand why she waited for him in the first place.  Plus being how pathetic he is survival skill wise, you wonder how she would have believed (as well as how he did) survive a mass zombie attack and hike to the shed, where the group they were a part of made a pact they would meet up within two days of an attack if they survived.  In a what would you do type movie, you certainly wouldn't do what this guy does, especially when your wife was in danger.Plague does have quite a good ending, a lot better than it looked like it would be, but overall I think it will be a bit slow, a bit too unoriginal, a bit too low budget and having too few zombies for most people's desires who are after a good zombie film.  The blurb on the Australian DVD cover claiming it to be Australia's version of The Walking Dead is very misleading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MP94P88ZMEAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQTD85A#wasThisHelpful","R1MP94P88ZMEAP","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tomorrowland's blurb on movie websites and on the back of the cover, didn't form a clear picture of what the heck this movie was going to be about, to say it was confusing was an understatement.  I figured once I got into the film I'd get it and I did like the actors that were in it so I figured I'd give it a go.  At the conclusion of the movie I still don't really know what the end part was all about but I enjoyed the movie anyway.  Once it gets going it has plenty of action and the acting by the child actors is very, very good.I will try and keep some things vague but you will encounter some mild spoilers if you continue to read on.  I can see how it would be annoying to some people but I liked how the movie changed the type of scifi movie it was as it progressed, we started off as a typical child saves the world film, with both the young child Clooney character and a mysterious same aged girl he obviously has a crush on motivating him to follow her in a 60's flashback and also a modern day set Brit Robertson's character (she's playing a teen in this one) who 80's movie style looks like she's going to outsmart the grownups with her inventions such as a drone that can disable security cameras so she can sabotage what she sees as a wrong, the adults dismantling of NASA's launch pad.Then we switch to a secret MIB style organisation experience revolving around a pin, then the film plays homage to cybornetic organisms trying to kill a threat, there's even an obvious remake or the T1000 running after the police car from Terminator 2 scene.  Then we go to the angry at the world grumpy man who doesn't want to let the annoying teenager into his house who he knows full well has no choice in the matter but to be there. Of course we've seen the booby trapped house with a well thought out with inventions escape plan a thousand times before as well.  Then of course we've got the this is the chosen one who will save the day that we've seen in Star Wars and plenty of other movies.  Now I didn't really quite understand the last part and the role Casey was supposed to play in the ""she can fix it"" destiny she had, but the movie still lots of fun anyway.Some parts weren't that realistic such as a smashed windshield not affecting a rocket going into space, when we know it affects passenger planes and also what happened to a shuttle with a cracked tile.  But I liked realistically they allowed collateral damage with humans such as the fireman getting vaporised or the Eiffel Tower security guard that Casey knocked out as well as tourists on the ground getting burnt up when the rocket launched.  It would be easy for a Disney film not to include that and dumb down the realism.  They still did in moments such as a tell you how great you are before I finally die speech that conveniently finishes just as death claims the character.Even though I didn't really understand the whole point of going into the alternative dimension and why Casey was even needed there, the film was entertaining and the journey from beginning to end a lot of fun.  It does go for over two hours and the extras show the cast and crew expecting to film at the NASA launch pad but being surprised by watching the Mars rocket take off.  Being that the two male adult main actors achieved their megastar status being top doctors in TV hospitals, it would have been nice if there had been a throw away line like, ""you know, we could have wasted out intelligence being doctors or something but instead chose to do this,"" by one to the other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M5QZBUQHHHX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAJ8RBI#wasThisHelpful","R2M5QZBUQHHHX3","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is easily the best of McCarthy's lead role movies, why because her character doesn't act like a bully and angry at the world woman for the whole film who thinks she comes across as strong by swearing abusive comments at everyone else.  She only does that during the second half of this one.  The first half has her as a much more likable character, the whole film is quite clever and a good contribution to the spy parody world.  Basically McCarthy's character has been trained with all the hand to hand combat skills, and ability to fly helicopters and planes and stuff like all Hollywood spies are, but because she looks like she does, has never been used in the field. Instead she's just Jude Law's character's ear piece voice who does all the cool and exciting in the field stuff while she watches through a camera.  Something goes wrong on one of his missions and she pleads to go into action as the identities of the other agents aren't so secret anymore.  She takes a little while to get used to and into the grove, meanwhile Jason Stratham's character is disgusted he's been sidelined for her and keeps turning up to save the day himself, but has an Inspector Gadget style habit of stuffing everything up and constantly needs to be saved.  Of course he never accepts that's what just happened.Unfortunately we do see the foul mouth rants start up once her character becomes more comfortable in her role as a spy. I love swearing in films when its in content and enhances the plot or a scene but that's not what you get with McCarthy at times.  There's a real annoying scene where she just swears at and puts down an innocent bodyguard for about a five minute rant just to make herself look like the better bodyguard. You could also argue there's a bit of racist stereotyping with another spy who acts like the skunk from Looney Tunes towards her throughout the mission.  A lot of the big sight gags you'll know from the previews, but there's still plenty of good gags you won't have seen.  Definitely worth checking out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQZJH1CWVUU4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C6OUPO#wasThisHelpful","RQZJH1CWVUU4Q","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty cool little Kombi van where unlike most 1/64 scale vehicles, Johnny Lightning have also put a lot of effort into painting the surfboards as well, rather than just having two black surfboard shaped bits of plastic on the roof.  The van is a nice orange colour with gives the bright Summer vibe.  The sides of the van have two female surfers (who I guess are the Huntington Honeys). Like other toy car manufacturers have done with their vehicles such as Mattel with their Sunburnerz '67 Pontiac whoever designed this thing obviously hasn't surfed or lives near the ocean as one of the women is riding the back of the wave. It still looks pretty cool though and the mistake adds to the fun. The van also has the words Huntington Honey's, on the sides not sure why the text has 's, unless its claiming they own the van.  The VW logo is also painted blue on the front.  There's a number plate spot on the front bumper, the only thing missing is a number plate.This is 1/64 scale so the same size as your mass produced Hot Wheels, Matchbox and other brand cars.  The wheels on this for a Johnny Lightning vehicle are a bit disappointing as it doesn't have rubber tyres with tread but more of your basic range Hot Wheels style ones. These wheels also mean it does't roll as smoothly or quietly as other Johnny Lightning vehicles. But the paint job on the mural, car itself and surfboards still put this well and truly above most other beach themed 1/64 scale vehicles out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A0R927OXO49B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VTFSZI#wasThisHelpful","R1A0R927OXO49B","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Funko Figures aren't supposed to look exactly like the character from the movie/TV show they are from, they all share the same look of a wide oversized head, with black eyes, the same nose and no mouth.  So they're basically the Funko character dressed as the movie character. The oversized head doesn't match well with Anna being a narrow faced girl whose hair draped over her shoulders and top of body.  With the Funko Figure her braided pig tails are just left hanging in mid air. But there really isn't anything Funko could have done about this, other than not having the big head, which would mean it really wouldn't be a Funko Pop Vinyl then. I've seen plenty of Anna and the other characters Frozen figures and dolls in stores, and this actually looks more like the cartoon character from the film than most of those do.  I do think they could have selected a better colour than green on the right side of her hair and through her right pig tail as I don't recall that being in the cartoon.  She did have white in her hair but if there was no white paint in the Funko factory I'm not real sure why you'd go with green.  I mean it was cold in the world of Frozen so perhaps she had a runny nose and didn't have a tissue and without thinking rubbed the snot though her hair.  I also don't like the red cheeks, Funko has done this Sookie Stackhouse and other female characters too, I really wish they wouldn't. They too included the clear plastic stand that clips into the hole in her shoe that they do with female Funkos.  Not sure why they do this at all, as she as does every other female Funko I have stands perfectly well without it.  The stands has no Frozen logo or anything on it, it's just a clear circle (I guess you could pretend it's ice with Anna) but really it doesn't enhance the display, and in fact you could easily miss it camouflaged amongst the internal clear blister in the box and throw it away if you don't keep the packaging. You can see it in the bottom row of my customer image where Anna Exorcist style has her head facing backwards.Other than the head rotation you can't pose Anna.  Her clothes look pretty accurate to an outfit she wore at one time in the film.  You can also get other Anna funkos wearing different dresses and even as her younger version self.Anna being a cartoon character of course who never gets a hair out of place or dirty means paint blemishes stand out and your mind can't really explain them away as acquired while the character was doing a certain thing or another.  It's going to be a gamble what paint blemishes will appear on the one you get, mine has darker paint in the fringe and on the face as well as dark brown in the hair.  Even if you buy your Funko figures from physical stores there's often blemishes on the back you can't see without opening the packaging, although the packaging is well designed to be opened without damaging it so you are seeing more and more people asking the staff if they can open them and show them the figure before purchasing.  I guess if buying online you could ask the seller to do so and e-mail you the photos.The box is great packaging that I really wish other figure manufacturers would learn from. As I said you can open the box, slide out the blister and remove the figure without damaging the box at all. There isn't even any tape or anything to cut. Then you can put the figure back inside if you decide to display it that way. You can view the figure from the front and one side of the box through the clear window. The boxes stack well on top of each other too, that's why it's great you can change your mind at how you want to display these Funkos.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BYZEHP6ZIC6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KU12UXO#wasThisHelpful","R2BYZEHP6ZIC6W","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Time Lapse is not a time travel movie, there is no time travel at all in the film. It's a movie where a camera takes a picture of what is happening in front of its lens 24 hrs into the future and prints out a polaroid of what is happening.  That lens is pointed at a big window of the living room of a small flat where three young adults live, who aren't the types who bother with curtains, including one who is the apartment manager so has keys to the apartment where the camera is, which is found when the elderly occupant's mail, newspapers and parking tickets start piling up and the manager's girlfriend checks to see if the old man is okay.The film is low budget and has no big name actors in it at all, in fact I don't recognise any of the cast from being in any movies or TV shows.  They aren't going to win an Oscar for their performance in Time Lapse but they do a pretty decent job.  The script at times maybe could have been better written to be believable such as the obvious why would you keep placing bets with the one bookie, especially when he's a violent type?  Perhaps there are people that stupid but surely the other two flat mates would have foreseen his stupidity and given him some advice. This type of film of course has you asking what would I do in this situation and no doubt you'd make more intelligent decisions but there wouldn't be much of a film is simply everyone just got rich. The film never explains how the camera can see into the future as conveniently the inventor is not alive to need to explain, so that aspect was well done.Overall though the movie is more than watchable, it's actually quite enjoyable.  Sure there have been other movies, books and TV shows dealing with glimpses into the future, even with a camera but so what? There's been plenty on most subjects films are made of.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WMYFLMOQA3F1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RDEIRB0#wasThisHelpful","R1WMYFLMOQA3F1","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sequel to The Highway although you could read this one as a standalone, but it does give away major plot points of that book.  It also mentions stuff from Back of Beyond which The Highway was a sequel to.  So it's best to read those two books first.  This one wasn't bad, and Box is never afraid to voice his opinions on subjects, but in Badlands it doesn't really flow into the storyline in a natural way at times.  At one point a character basically listing by dot points her (or Box's) pros and cons.  You've also got the standard older character apologising for not knowing what to do around a woman these days, should he offered to help her luggage or will she be offended?

He also finds a bag which he takes home which his druggie mum's boyfriend claims.  Of course there are some really bad people who want their stuff back.

"Freddy is a nice addition to any Funko figure or even horror character figure collection.  Of course you can get more movie resembling figures, but that's not what Funko Figures are about.  Funko figures always have a resemblance to a basic look figure with the wide oversized head, black eyes, no mouth and same nose on all their figures.  This one still does resemble the character from the Nightmare on Elm Street films pretty well too. This one seems to have had a lot more effort put into its design than most other Funko Pop Vinyl figures. They've put a fair bit of detail into making the head resemble one that is scarred from the skin being burnt.  Including the ears.  Freddy actually ends up being a little taller than other Funko figures when displayed beside them due to his hat.  The hat along with the rest of his clothing can't be removed, it's permanently attached, with everything being part of the one mold. You can't pose him in different stances or anything, except you can move his head, in fact you can even Exorcist style having it facing the back of his body.  His claw hand, deserves special mention, it simply looks brilliant.  The paintwork on the entire figure is well done, the hat has a falling apart at the top look where it looks like the leather is deteriorating around a hole with little black dots.  His unofficial South Sydney jersey you can see the lines making it resemble wool.  Like all Funko figures though, quality control at the factory isn't the greatest and there are bits of stray paint .  Mine isn't too bad just a spot of light brown on the pants, a few black spots on the back of the head, both are things Freddy could have picked up on his nightly routines so it doesn't wreck it or anything. Unlike some other characters paint blemishes can't really detract from this figure too much.  But paint blemishes are always going to be an issue with these figures and it's going to be a bit of gamble unfortunately to where they appear on the figure you get.  Even if you buy your Funko figures from physical stores there's often blemishes on the back you can't see without opening the packaging, although the packaging is well designed to be opened without damaging it so you are seeing more and more people asking the staff if they can open them and show them the figure before purchasing.The box is great packaging that I really wish other figure manufacturers would learn from. As I said you can open the box, slide out the blister and remove the figure without damaging the box at all. There isn't even any tape or anything to cut. Then you can put the figure back inside if you decide to display it that way. You can view the figure from the front and one side of the box through the clear window. The boxes stack well on top of each other too, that's why it's great you can change your mind at how you want to display these Funkos.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUB2NZ6NJ97ZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GFPFBO#wasThisHelpful","RUB2NZ6NJ97ZM","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sort of the opposite of Jim Carey's Liar Liar character, in this scenario Gervais' character lives on a planet where no one can lie, except one day something malfunctions in his brain and he can.  The fun in this movie is actually before that happens with everyone just being brutally honest, as there is no such thing as a little white lie to protect someone's feelings.  Everyone has to tell it like it is and of course since this is the norm no one sees anything wrong with that.  There's a fair bit of storyline potential and more importantly comedy that isn't really covered with the ability to lie in a world where no one realises you are.  In the world this is set in for some reason because you can't lie you also want to marry someone who will give you the best genetic outcome children rather than marry someone you have fun with or who is a nice person.  The reason for this is never really explained and was just convenient for the romantic side of the storyline with Garner's character.The Invention of Lying though is still an interesting and very enjoyable movie to watch and one well worth investing your time with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BZJOUP00AYQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00275EHBY#wasThisHelpful","R2BZJOUP00AYQG","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty nicely done Funko Pop Vinyl figure of Saul in a suit with a mobile phone ear piece.  The ear piece and suit is all part of the one mold and can't be taken off.  You can't pose his arms so he's always going to be pointing, but you can rotate his head,  even 180 degrees Exorcist style if you want to pose him that way.  He stands on a flat surface no problem at all.  The figure nicely captures both the Funko figure essence as well as resembles pretty well (albeit with a much wider head) the character from Breaking Bad and lesser extent the spin off Better Call Saul (simply as he wore less expensive successful style suits and other clothing on the prequel TV show).The box is great packaging that I really wish other figure manufacturers would learn from. You can open the box, slide out the blister and remove the figure without damaging the box at all. There isn't even any tape or anything to cut. Then you can put the figure back inside if you decide to display it that way. The back of the box has pictures of nine other Breaking Bad Funkos that were released before or at the same time. You can view the figure from the front and one side of the box through the clear window.

"Frankenstein's Monster is pretty well done as a Funko Pop figure. He both resembles the Funko line of figures with the rectangular head, no mouth, black eyes and everything else you'd expect to see there, as well as pays a decent homage to the creature from the various films and cartoons that have been based on Universal Studio's interpretation of the creature.  He stands up no problem at all by himself.  Like other Funkos he doesn't really do anything else, he's a display piece, you can rotate his head around though, even Exorcist style 180 degrees.  So the bolts in the side of his neck Dr Frankenstein put there obviously aren't doing there job.  They look pretty cool on the figure though. As does the jacket and clothes, which are all the same mold and don't come off.  Frankenstein's monster is pretty durable if you were buying it to be played with.The box is great packaging that I really wish other figure manufacturers would learn from. You can open the box, slide out the blister and remove the figure without damaging the box at all. There isn't even any tape or anything to cut. Then you can put the figure back inside if you decide to display it that way. The back of the box has pictures of seven other Universal Monsters figures that were released at the same time. The only fault with this figure's box is that it calls Frankenstein's monster, Frankenstein who of course was the doctor who made him. You can view the figure from the front and one side of the box through the clear window. The boxes stack well on top of each other too, that's why it's great you can change your mind at how you want to display these Funkos.  At the moment I display my figures standing on top of the boxes which are all turned to the side with the cartoon of the figure and beside each other.

"This is a slow paced coming of age type story for the American male character, who falls in love with an Italian woman while on the run in Europe for beating up one his customers while off the clock, who tried to glass his colleague.  In Evan's eyes, this beautiful Italian woman is unlike any girl he's encountered before, he doesn't know how right he is.  For her he is a mate needed for a certain purpose but a fun mate none the less as the relationship can't possibly be more than that.  Or can it?  This isn't a horror film, it's a film about life where the female character just happens to have a disability that has her transform into something we label a monster, that she tries to slow down the process for with injections and other methods involving Ethan.  The banter between the two is quite enjoyable to watch and could easily have worked if they had been transported into a more traditional chick flick type romantic comedy setting.Spring has faults in the plot for sure, but if you watch the extras you'll see those behind the film were perfectly aware of them.  You can watch how bad a farmer the Evan's mentor/landlord actually is for example as everything he does wrong is paused and highlighted for example.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1835FAC5WC2OG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAVNK46#wasThisHelpful","R1835FAC5WC2OG","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Orhpan Black with season 3 continues the great acting by Tatiana Maslany who somehow makes you forget she's one actress playing multiple characters as she introduces mannerisms and personalities completely unique to each one.  I found this season to be the most fun of the three so far with the introduction of a Breaking Bad style decision by one of the clones (I won't give away which one) which was just brilliant.  The male clones who unlike Sarah's ""sisters"" have always been aware of each other and share in a creepy way but still with distinct personalities were also acted well by Ari Millen, that you completely forgot they were being played by the same guy too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO5XRAJAAITYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMDEZBK#wasThisHelpful","RO5XRAJAAITYA","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Funko Stay Puft is pretty cool.  He is bigger than your usual sized Funko figure but not to the same high rise scale bigger as the one in the movie compared to the humans.  He is still small enough that if you get the Ecto 1 display stand, as well he fits inside the driver rectangle (see my customer images).  He is a pretty simple Funko, basically he is mostly white (and I have no problems with the paint job) with a Donald Duck style sailor shoulder covering with red ribbon tie and the hat.  The hat has the words Stay Puft on it around the stem or whatever you'd call that part. You can't pose his arms or move his legs or anything, like the smaller Funkos he's set in the one stance.  His head does rotate though, and Exorcist style he can rotate his head 180 degrees.  He does look pretty cool, he captures the Funko essence with the resemblance to the other figures with the eyes, and same shaped head.  Differently though he actually does have a mouth, the area around the mouth is slightly raised.  The eyes have a white bit on the bottom of the back, I think this was to give the impression of the big cheeks he has in the movie but in reality just looks like his eyes are on upside down with he eyelids starting to shut. With these eyes he still looks good though.  He also stands upright by himself no problem.Inside the box he is the same height as the boxed display stand for the Crystal Ship if you bought that Breaking Bad one.  It's the same box design just bigger than regular sized Funkos come in, so you can open it, slide out the blister and take him out.  Then if you change your mind put him back inside later without having wrecked the packaging at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OAEVO6IXNCZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGAXBKW#wasThisHelpful","R1OAEVO6IXNCZY","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Previously I read a great picture book called The Croco Dolly by this author so wanted to check out what else he wrote.  The other book had a little girl trying to pass of a crocodile as a doll since she wasn't allowed to own a pet, and Octopuppy has a similar concept with Edgar, a boy disappointed that his pet octopus isn't acting like the dog he wanted, and at one time tries to get him to win a dog contest, but Jarvis, the ""Octopuppy"" just doesn't do tricks like a canine would.The story is pretty simple text wise, but there's a lot more going on in the illustrations (and the illustrations are really well drawn in a fun cartoon style).  This is the type of book you point to different parts of the page and ask the children you're reading it to what is going on.  Basically it teaches the lesson of if something doesn't meet the exact same functions as you'd wish for (or someone) then take the time to notice what it actually does do.

"The first episode of Better Call Saul was pretty boring, with nothing much happening until the skateboard con artists make an appearance near the end. To be honest if I hadn't enjoyed Breaking Bad so much I probably would have stopped watching after about half an hour. The second episode which is the aftermath of those decisions with the skateboarders was easily the best of all ten on the DVD, and the closest the show ever got to resembling Breaking Bad's quality. Breaking Bad was a show that sometimes had long drawn out even at times boring scenes between the great TV scenes, but Better Call Saul seems to have a lot more of them and never really reaches the quality of Breaking Bad with it's own good scenes. There are though occasionally some interesting scenes and other characters, his brother who can't cope with electricity or being outside stealing a newspaper, then (and a bit ridiculously) the cops turning up after that was interesting but for the most part his scenes are just filler. Besides Saul we're also seeing the prequel Albuquerque Breaking Bad world of Mike (Jonathan Banks) who we initially visit as a parking lot boom gate operator who won't show any flexibility to Saul's mistakes with validating his parking card. For the most part, he is not that interesting a character in this series, although there is one good episode where he takes on some casual work as a bodyguard who doesn't need a gun even though the client and others think it is a must.Some scenes are a bit predictable such as the billboard one, and there's far too many sudden flashbacks where we catch on to the fact as Saul (or Jimmy as he known) has a bigger mullet type of hairstyle. We're already watching a prequel, do we need to visit a prequel world to the prequel so often?Better Call Saul is watchable, and although I won't rush out to get season 2, I will eventually watch it, but this show simply wasn't as entertaining or clever as I had imagined it would be.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WO73R6X5DSUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZVYX8OU#wasThisHelpful","R1WO73R6X5DSUF","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I started reading this the characters started referring to events that sounded pretty familiar and there was mention of a lawn mowing business that I'm pretty sure was in a prior Barclay novel.  Sure enough when I finished it and looked it up those events and the exact same characters were on the pages of Too Close to Home.  Be nice to mention the fact this is a sequel somewhere on the cover.  Then you can also throw in a book called Never Look Away which has the same journalist character, writing for the same paper that he get laid off from at the start of this.  It even has a ferris wheel on the cover which is probably the one in a scene in this book. In fact when you get to the final page you'll realise most of the questions raised in this one aren't answered, and no attempt was ever made to wrap up, not just the sub plots, but a major murder that is the basis for a lot of this book's occurrences.  Also at the end is an excerpt from a yet to be published novel that involves a minor character in this one who recounts a major event at the end of this one he partook with his dad and also mentions his friend died for no reason he could comprehend (which was one of the unfinished parts of this book that we read about when we're half way through).  That story is Far From True, but wait the confusion just increases as that is not the next book set to be published in this ""Promise Falls"" series, that one is a novella called Final Assignment.You can understand the events going on in Broken Promise's pages if you haven't read Too Close to Home or Never Look Away, but you'll still be annoyed you've been left hanging like a 60's TV show, the only thing missing is a voice over telling you to tune in next week, same bat time, same bat channel.  Broken Promise also doesn't have the usual Barclay can't put down factor, it simply isn't that good.Seriously Broken Promise is even listed on some retail  sites as being book one in the Promise Falls series.  You'd think someone in Barclay's publishing company would be aware they've already published two books set in the town of that name with the same characters in them, written by the same author.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVQHZHUV9Y4SK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1409146456#wasThisHelpful","RVQHZHUV9Y4SK","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this show when it aired on TV back when I was a high school kid in the 90s.  I always remembered the quirkiness of the show and some of the episodes that tackled by putting a mirror up so to speak for reflections on opinions of the time,and how society dealt with them, through the plot.  So when I saw this on DVD, I had to watch the show again.  Doing so a lot of episode plot twists you do remember, but that doesn't take away from the fact that each episode is still entertaining.  I do remember some ignorance at the time to some of these issues, of course a lot of myths and education on the issues was done through the school system too but I seem to remember we had a lot better understanding of AIDS than the show presented with the dentist episode, we also knew that a conversation with an adult saying they experimented at university wouldn't make your daughter a lesbian. So at times the ignorance or extreme bigotry of the town or even each of the Brock parents at different times does seem pretty implausible.There are definitely inconsistencies with the storyline, such as the first episode everyone in the sheriff's department is chomping at the bit to get a share of the action in the town's first ever murder, as those never happen in Rome, yet about half of the episodes following had someone murdered or at least someone tried to kill someone.  Overall the characters of Rome each had their quirks which made the show entertaining and for the most part were fairly likable.  The Brock parents at times weren't though, such as the mother caring more about her husband going home and talking to her daughter so she doesn't choose to live with her biological mother, rather than being at the scene where his deputy is being held with a gun pointed at her head by a man who thinks he's Santa.  Also the way she treated her previously single father and the new woman he was dating simply because she was younger than her was pretty deplorable.  Sheriff Brock wasn't always a great guy either at times. Not promoting his best officer because she was a woman, the way he treated his daughter when his son eavesdropped on a conversation and thought she was a lesbian.I found the lawyer Douglas Wambaugh to be annoying most of the time, but loved the judge.  The judge was really the moral voice of the town, when bigotry or fear resulted in the victim in his court for justice.  He sort of played the parent or leader of the town who had to tell off the misbehaving kids and force them to think about the big picture when they were basically acting like selfish or paranoid idiots.Picket Fences' tackling of issues may most of the time when watching it today seem a bit dated, or even ridiculous at times, but the episode surrounding that issue is usually quite entertaining.  What other show can have a woman murder someone with a steamroller and try to get off because they were suffering from menopause?  I can't wait to re-watch the second season for the first time since I saw it on TV next!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRFCCYBEV62O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000K7VHJ6#wasThisHelpful","RRFCCYBEV62O","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You will also find a Boba Fett character car amongst a previous Disney Racers line, that one is more helmet themed than this one.

"I'd put off buying the two pack with R2D2 after he'd passed out of the small intestine of a Dewback and where C3PO had a rusted look, simply as they both didn't look good at all.  So I'm glad to see they finally released C3PO in a single blister and an undamaged version too.  The vehicle represents the Star Wars droid well, with the soft curves connecting the roof to the sides matching the body of the movie robot.  The VW Kombi van is a pretty good choice too.

"I'll point out that like another reviewer my figure also came with the box covered in brown paint on the front window, but unlike that reviewer I'm not going to rate a product down because the seller couldn't be bothered to use a drop cloth when doing some painting.  It's not Funko or the product's fault either, sure the seller should let customers know and not send them out that way,sell them as seconds or whatever, but that's what seller feedback and the links to contact your seller are all about, not the product review page as everyone who sells one on here now or in the future (including those of us who've bought one if we need money one day) shouldn't be tainted with the same brown paint brush.The figure is pretty well detailed, doesn't entirely look like Bill Murray of course, but it's a nice cartoon like version of him and you definitely know who he is if you take him out of the box.  He stands perfectly fine by himself but there is also a stand (which is basically a black circle with a two pointy bits to insert into a hole in both his shoes.  There is no Ghostbusters logo or anything on the stand to enhance the display so I don't bother with it. His clothes and pack are all part of the one mold, and don't come off, nor can you pose him in any other stance.The Vinyl Idolz are a lot taller than your standard Pop Vinyl figures including the Ghostbuster versions, but they still look cool displayed beside the Ecto 1 display stand and the Pop Vinyl Winston driver.

"Dr Egon Spengler Vinyl Idolz is pretty well detailed, it looks very similar to how the late actor looked in the 80's film. You do have to be weary that Funko figures do come with paint blemishes on them, mine has a bit of white paint in the hair and one ear, so it's a bit of a gamble but these things are pretty inexpensive (at the time of review) so are pretty great for what you're paying for them.  Even if you're in a physical store and can't see any on the front, often there's some on the back of the figure that you can't see.  You do see more and more people asking to open the box in the shop so perhaps that's something you might want to ask the seller to do and photograph for you if the price is getting higher.  The packaging is designed to do just that, without damaging it all.The figure comes with a stand, although you don't need it as he stands fine by himself.  The stand has no Ghostbusters symbol or anything else on it, it's just black, I've never bothered to use mine with any of the Vinyl Idolz figures when I've displayed them out of their boxes.  That's the great thing about these figures and their packaging.  They come in pretty cool phone booth style cardboard boxes. The box is pretty easy to open and take Egon out without causing any damage to the packaging. If you're buying one online, or even in a shop for that matter, there is no way you're going to know if it has ever been opened or not though. There's no tape to cut or anything, you just open the box at the top or the bottom, slide out the bubble, open it up clam like, and take him out. I like this sort of packaging though, as you've always got the option to display him in the box, or out of it. The box has a little spiel about the character and a photo (of the doll) on the back. You can see the figure from both sides of the front while it's in the box, and for some reason it has a weird green shiny backing that sort of glows like he's from The X-files of something, when the sunlight hits it.The clothes, pack and everything are all the one mold.  You can't remove any or pose the figure in any other way.  But it does look pretty cool.  I display Ray, Egon and Venkman alongside the Pop Vinyl Ecto 1 display stand with Winston (Funko pop figure that comes with it) driving.I don't know what scene Egon's pose is from but here's a classic bit of the character's wit.Dr. Egon Spengler: I have a radical idea.

"This and the other Ghostbusters character Vinyl Idolz are pretty well done and highly detailed.  They are a lot taller than your usual Funko Pop figures, and resemble the character (in this case Dr Raymond Stantz) a lot more than the Funko Pop Figures.  Ray is of course holding up the trap with Slimer inside it from the hotel around the time of the movie's classic lines.Dr Ray Stantz: [holding ghost trap like a rat by the tail] We got it!Hotel Manager: What is it? Will there be any more of them?Dr Ray Stantz: Sir, what you have there is what we refer to as a focused, non-terminal, repeating phantasm, or a Class Five full roaming vapor. Real nasty one, too!Dr. Peter Venkman: Now, let's talk seriously, now. For the entrapment, we're gonna have to ask you for...Dr. Egon Spengler: [holds up four fingers]Dr. Peter Venkman: ...four big ones. Four thousand dollars for that. But we are having a special this week on proton charging...Dr. Egon Spengler: [holds up one finger]Dr. Peter Venkman: ...one thousand dollars, fortunately.Hotel Manager: Five thousand dollars? I had no idea it would be so much. I won't pay it.Dr. Peter Venkman: Well, that's all right, we can just put it right back in there.Dr Ray Stantz: We certainly can, Dr. Venkman.[turning back to ballroom]Hotel Manager: No, no, no, no! All right! I'll pay anything!Dr. Peter Venkman: Thanks so much.The figure comes with a stand, although you don't need it as he stands fine by himself.  The stand has no Ghostbusters symbol or anything else on it, it's just black, I've never bothered to use mine with any of the Vinyl Idolz figures when I've displayed them out of their boxes.  That's the great thing about these figures and their packaging.  They come in pretty cool phone booth style cardboard boxes. The box is pretty easy to open and take Ray out without causing any damage to the packaging. If you're buying one online, or even in a shop for that matter, there is no way you're going to know if it has ever been opened or not though. There's no tape to cut or anything, you just open the box at the top or the bottom, slide out the bubble, open it up clam like, and take him out. I like this sort of packaging though, as you've always got the option to display him in the box, or out of it. The box has a little spiel about the character and a photo (of the doll) on the back. You can see the figure from both sides of the front while it's in the box, and for some reason it has a weird green shiny backing that sort of glows like he's from The X-files of something, when the sunlight hits it.The clothes, trap, headgear and pack and everything are all the one mold.  You can't remove any or pose the figure in any other way.  But it does look pretty cool.  I display Ray, Egon and Venkman alongside the Pop Vinyl Ecto 1 display stand with Winston (Funko pop figure that comes with it) driving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N5I7X8NN8RPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKF6266#wasThisHelpful","R3N5I7X8NN8RPK","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is pretty cool, it is a nice representation of the RV from the show and even comes with some pants hanging off the right side mirror.  They should have positioned the RV to be facing the right instead of left in the blister packaging so you could see them easily but if you keep this in the packaging then you've just got to squint and look in the gap between the vehicle and the cardboard to see them.  It's pretty good packaging though, with a nice photo of Walter White in the top left and the Breaking Bad word logo on the right.  So you'll probably want to keep it in there.  The packaging is pretty durable being it is completely covered in plastic.  I've had a number of Johnny Lightning vehicles with this packaging and all you do is wipe the dust off, you can even run the thing under a tap if you want.  The cardboard inside stays dry but the sun does fade it.  I wish more die-cast cars came in this sort of packaging when it's pretty obvious most people won't be removing the vehicle from the pack.  On the back is another promo photo or maybe even a still from the TV show with Walter (as Heisenberg) on the back next to Jesse.  The RV is in the background in the middle of a field of long dry brown grass.You can also find the same vehicle by Greenlight in a non Breaking Bad packaging.  If you're planning on taking this out of the packaging you might want to consider that one if its cheaper, since the packaging isn't the type you can reuse. That one probably doesn't have the pants on the side mirror though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R134JWTYHU1V9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010F8ZEYI#wasThisHelpful","R134JWTYHU1V9X","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another great season of The Walking Dead.  For me the whole Terminus part that we'd been hanging out to see how it developed since the end of Season 4 was dealt and finished with way too quickly but other than that it was great.  We find out what happened to Beth in this season, a fair bit more about the newer joinees of the group with the mission to get one of them to Washington and of course there are plenty of bad humans along the way.  The actor who played the title character from Everybody Hates Chris (Tyler Williams) plays a survivor in this season too.  Although zombies aren't as big a threat to the group as other survivors there's still a couple of really cool looking ones such as some that were napalmed and stuck to the carpark and have been burnt by the sun in the years since, and another group of zombies who have been trapped in water with their soggy skin hanging off them.  In the extras (Australian version anyway) we see those actors getting zombified and other cool stuff.

"Basically with any missing kids movie one two things happened, the kid has run away to what is, even in reality or perception, a better, safer, perhaps more exciting life and never plans to return or let anyone know where it went so the life it ran away from can't catch up to it. Or something bad happened to the kid, such as it was abducted, murdered or simply got lost and perished due to not having the skills to find it's way home and survive in the harsh realities of nature.  So when you buy a movie about missing kids, you're kind of expecting a number of clues in the story line along the way for you to guess what happened and by the end of the film you're either proven wrong or right, but either way you know.  With the case of a small town outback town like this, everyone of course is a suspect.The problem with Strangerland though is that every single character in the film throughout either prior to the disappearance or after is given a possible motive, be it that they are into sleeping with underage girls, or they are the parent of one covering it up. Perhaps it's a gypsy curse style vengeance thing for nearly careless driving running down an old aboriginal elder in a 4WD either through some indigenous rainbow serpent type thing or a simple murder and blame it on the legend. Even the small town cop could have done or had worked out who did and was covering up for them if not himself since he determined where the SAS volunteers searched and if he ever contacted Telstra to find out who was calling the parent's house, he never revealed who it was. Plus the sheer number of those volunteers for such a small town meant there was a fairly sizable one near enough for those people to come from that would also have trucks and other suppliers coming and going in the area resulting in it a complete stranger we never see. Either of the parents of course could been responsible either through abuse or something as a motive for one or both of the children running away (with the other following in the night either known or unknown to the other), or simply as a killer.  Perhaps one of them was even keeping the kid locked away somewhere else in an old mine or something they'd stumbled across since they both drove around a lot.The point is no questions are ever answered, sure there's the suggestion that there was a car at one point but that source could very well have been making that up just to stop being hassled, or either to cover up their own guilt, or show the person who did the crime that they won't be telling what really happened.  Or perhaps it was the simple case of a run away who caught a lift with a trucker and is now in a big city somewhere.  That's the problem, we the viewer are left to our own assumptions.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ETT5CAZXP5TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3DC6OE#wasThisHelpful","R3ETT5CAZXP5TK","AIO247KHD2O40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIO247KHD2O40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"On their last CD, Fall Out Boy announced their mission was to ""Save Rock And Roll."" On the follow-up, ""American Beauty/American Psycho,"" it sounds like they're still headed out on that path. There's some righteous rock here. And there seems to be a theme here, it's all about the juxtapositions.For example, the title track. You're blending a Brent Easton Ellis horror novel with a Grateful Dead album of classic Americana. Add Patrick Stump bouncing the word ""Psycho"" into a bouncy sing along, and you have the makings for a concert staple. The same with ""Uma Thurman."" Placing the ""Pulp Fiction"" star inside a song that mashes in the theme to ""The Munsters"" is something close to a work of genius. Then there's the heroics. Suzanne Vega's ""dit dit doo doo"" hook from ""Tom's Diner"" teases the intro before Stump challenges the listener. ""You Will Remember Me...for Centuries"" Stump wails to music meant to be played over a sports highlights reel. Same goes with ""Immortals."" Fall Out Boy are back to make rock that knows no limitations (there's nothing here that resembles a sappy ballad), and you'll have a very good time if you just let yourself follow along.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G2Y054659IKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QBEQWII#wasThisHelpful","R3G2Y054659IKM","A3KJ6JAZPH382D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KJ6JAZPH382D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sporting a deeper groove and riffs that would make a voodoo bluesman proud, Marilyn Manson takes back his seat at the table for ""The Pale Emperor."" With 2012's ""Born Villain,"" Manson seemed to be getting his full swagger back, and here he takes full advantage of his place as elder statesman and lead crank in the old school of LA evil that Manson had as his own court back in the ""Dope Show"" days.The sound is sleeker and more percussive than usual, adding menace where before might have been labored screaming. Manson, to his credit, still uses all sorts of voices for dramatic effect to get what he wants, but instead of hectic he goes for menacing. ""Killing Strangers,"" ""The Pale Emperor's"" pulsing opening cut, sounds like it slithered its way out of some hell-hounded biker bar, made even more so by Manson's insistence that ""we got guns, you better run"" growled in a nasty fashion. He's no longer tethered to a media that demands that he produce a hit ""single,"" leaving him to operate as an outsider of sorts in his advancing years.I mean that in a good way. The man who was once blamed for mass school shootings now plies his trade in TV and movies along with his music. (His multi-episode stint on ""Sons Of Anarchy"" was actually kind of funny.) So he can be, as he puts it himself, ""The Mephistopheles Of Los Angeles,"" all while sounding like he can still raise the devil when he wants to. He may sing that he's ready to meet his maker, but with ""The Pale Emporer,"" Marilyn Manson still makes like he could scare that man off for a few more rounds. It's also been said that much of the album's songs were single takes. All the better to grit and glitter you with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24H3LCA8CS6BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEJG1K0#wasThisHelpful","R24H3LCA8CS6BQ","A3KJ6JAZPH382D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KJ6JAZPH382D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This overlong, over bearing and over weaning documentary shows two kinds of Metallica sessions. There are the musical sessions that become the ""St. Anger"" album, and the therapy sessions that show the three core members of Metallica as a dysfunctional bunch of puffed up jerks. (Well, maybe not so much Kirk Hammet, who spends most of the movie being quiet.) The problem is, at two hours and twenty minutes, the war between Lars and James gets old, and fast! Had ""Some Kind Of Monster"" delved into more of the creative processes instead of dragging on and on with the endless analysis, this may have been an interesting 90 minute VH1 special. But Noooooo! Apparently those with creative control over this monster decided that every little nose-picking argument had to be preserved for posterity.There are the occasional interesting moments. These include Lars' Dad telling him that the songs ""don't cut it."" The band plotting to ditch their therapist Dr Phil, and then the therapist guilt tripping the band to keep him on. Lars' comment that the original bassist Cliff Burton might not have made the cut for auditions. You can even almost feel for James as he slams the door on the band, then books himself into rehab. Ditto for Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine, shown confronting Lars about getting dumped by and living in the shadow of Metallica. (Is the Megadeth therapy DVD coming next?)But frankly, this isn't anywhere near as interesting as it could have been. Both The Ramones' ""End Of The Century"" and Wilco's ""I am Trying To Break Your Heart"" are scads more interesting than the whiny blob that Frankensteined into ""Some Kind Of Monster.""","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D8QXXRKLOSBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQVRZS6#wasThisHelpful","R3D8QXXRKLOSBL","A3KJ6JAZPH382D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KJ6JAZPH382D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sucked into the quicksand of its own hype, theatrical rock singer Jobriath's second album went virtually unnoticed in 1974. LP copies of his debut and ""Creatures of The Street"" were so rare that collectors were shelling out big bucks for them on e-bay and similar sites. It took the fandom of one Morrissey and his compilation reissue of Lonely Planet Boy to remind folks that Jobriath was for real.With that identity re-established, the Collectors' Choice wing of Rhino has brought Jobriath's two albums back onto the marketplace. You can now listen to them 35 years after the deadly hype that drowned them and after Jobriath's death in 1983. Unfortunately, you can also hear the reasons why Jobraith's music never really caught on through ""Creatures of The Street."" The music comes off as stagy and more than a little pretentious, with arrangements that sound like they were tailored for a Broadway Musical. The two brief interlude/bridges, ""What a Pretty"" and ""Dietrich/Fondyke,"" are pointless theater, and frankly, Jobriath was not the best of vocalists.That said, there are a few songs here that are solid trashy glam. ""Good Times"" and ""Heartbeat"" are decent, and probably helped establish Jobriath's live reputation (google his videos sometime, there are a couple). ""Scumbag"" is close to Elton John's character sketches, while ""Ooo La La"" is kind of soulful. His band, the creatures, plays with zing and the string/orchestral arrangements add nicely, if a bit over the top. But it's too little too late, as Jobriath could not escape the fact that the antics of his manager had so derailed his career that he'd become an industry joke (Elektra Records chief Jac Holzman famously stated, ""I made two errors of judgment in my days at Elektra and signing Jobriath was one of them"").Freed from the atmosphere of the time, you can now listen to Jobriath's concept album as an entity on its own. While it plays out as a story of men and women lured into the trap of glamour and fame, it could also read as an epitaph for the late singer himself, as he died of AIDS in NYC, a bitter and forgotten recluse who made his living playing cabaret piano in New York dives. The release of Jobriath's two albums provides a much needed footnote to a man who wanted to be something, pushed to the barb-wire fence as hard as he could, and wound up being the forgotten body everyone in the more androgynous 80's climbed across. I can only recommend Jobriath's CDs to historical completists of either glam rock or gay subculture.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZBXI331D7YRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W05MSI#wasThisHelpful","R1ZBXI331D7YRL","A3KJ6JAZPH382D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KJ6JAZPH382D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Better than the overproduced ""Overexposed,"" ""V"" is Maroon 5's return to making candy-floss pop. I mean that as a compliment. As many bands that try to make this kind of music, few succeed at it quite the way Adam Levine and the boys do. Want more proof? Just think of Adam's TV stint on ""The Voice,"" where assorted contestants vie for the opportunity to make this kind of music (with the odd country or soul belter mixed in for variety) and remind yourself that the show has yet to turn out a viable star. If it was that easy, they'd all have sales of the magnitude Maroon 5 have achieved.For one thing, Maroon 5 know their way around a killer hook. Both ""Maps"" and ""Animals"" have hooks so big they belong in butcher shops and Adam's blue eyed soul delivery (and falsetto) make them stick to your ear canals. He also knows how to deliver one for the ladies, as the ballad ""Unkiss Me"" shows. The big piano ballad with Gwen Stefani, ""My Heart Is Open"" is a wonderful pairing, although ""Moves Like Jagger"" wins the duet contest by virtue of its snappiness. Yet Maroon 5 provide the fizz that pop in the 10's needs to stand above the fray.I'll add an extra recommendation for the deluxe version of ""V"" in that two of the three songs are actually worthy of the couple extra bucks. There's the surprisingly bare bones version of the 90's one hit wonder Marcy Playground's ""Sex And Candy."" Then theirs the Levine solo track ""Lost Stars,"" which Levine recorded for the movie ""Begin Again"" which Levine had an acting role in. They round out ""V"" and make it an album to rival Maroon 5's better entries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23V93YQZ6E3Y7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIIT87C#wasThisHelpful","R23V93YQZ6E3Y7","A3KJ6JAZPH382D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KJ6JAZPH382D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Long overdue but well worth the wait, ""The Morning Lasted All Day"" finally collects a solid set of The Dream Academy's best from their three albums, a few B-sides and oddities and the brand new ""Sunrising."" Augmented with a comprehensive booklet written by Nick Laird-Clowes, exquisitely remastered with his supervision, this is about as good a Dream Academy anthology as a fan could hope for.While it naturally is heavily weighted in favor of their dynamic debut, both ""Remembrance Days"" and ""A Different Kind Of Weather"" are given exposure. (I've always been of the mindset that ""Weather,"" despite the fact that it didn't even chart in the US, has been vastly underrated.) The band's chamber-pop gets much of its otherworldliness from Kate St,John's oboe and other reed instruments flowing beneath Laird-Clowes' folkish guitars and vocal delivery. There's a lovely sort of soft focus to many of their songs that made the majority of them dificult to fit in during the synth-heavy 80's, leaving such contenders as ""Indian Summer"" and ""Power To Believe"" (included here both in its instrumental version as heard on the ""Planes Trains and Automobiles"" soundtrack, and the vocal version from ""Remembrance Days"") frozen out of the top 40.The ethereal quality of their songs a times masked the presence of noteworthy contributors. Friend of the band and Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour was a frequent collaborator and co-producer, Lindsay Buckingham co-producing and adding background vocals to ""Indian Summer,"" and The Smiths' guitarist Johnny Marr playing on ""Ballad In 4/4."" It takes away nothing from the band's presentation, even offering proof just how powerful The Dream Academy 'sound' was to all the stages of the band's recording history.I have a few of my own favorites to recommend as a fan, one of them being the lovely version of John Lennon's ""Love,"" as featured on ""Weather."" Actually using a drum-loop, Laird-Clowes brings an emphasis to Lennon's message (including a portion of ""#9 Dream"") that few covers of Lennon have done. The cover of The Smiths' ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" is good for a smile, and I have always thought ""Indian Summer"" was a single cheated out of deserved hit status. Then there's ""Sunrising,"" the first new Dream Academy song in 30 years. It's a welcome treat and fits in with the band's legacy, with Gilbert Gabriel's piano painting the mood (alas, St.John is not featured on it).Even with that minor wish not coming true, I am very happy to have ""The Morning Lasted All Day"" to augment my original CD's of The Dream Academy. The remastering enables you to hear things that were tempered in the originals, and makes for a satisfying listening experience.

"There's no-one else alive that can power-chord the way Angus Young can. Or yowl the way Brian Johnson does. It's why any AC/DC album is met with such great anticipation. This time, from the powerful title track to the walking shuffle of ""Emission Control,"" ""Rock Or Bust"" delivers hammer-down rock like only AC/DC can.Another noteworthy thing about ""Rock Or Bust"" is its brevity. Clocking in at 11 songs in 35 minutes, it delivers short and sharp stabs of guitar and Phil Rudd's primitive thud, Each song delivers its message, solo and gets out of its own way as soon as the meat is delivered. Heck, the great ""Play Ball"" (heard during the 2014 MLB World Series) gets it done in under 3 minutes. While it may disappoint fans who would rather Angus wing-it off into super solo land or a blues workout or two, to me it's like a prize fighter dispensing with the dancing and heading straight for the knockout punch.At times the lyrics fall into beer raising similarity (4 songs that have 'rock' in the title is more than a little telling), but the album doesn't suffer from it. You don't come to an AC/DC party looking for PhD material. ""Rock Or Bust"" is AC/DC proving their point.

"This speaker is just awesome. The audio quality is excellent, especially considering the form factor. If you are a hardcore audiophile, then I'm sure you can find issues to focus on here - but for a small, portable speaker you're not going to do much better. This sound quality is what we've come to expect from Bose, and this product is no different. It's loud and clear, with solid bass. Music just sounds awesome on this speaker, it's top notch. It's almost shocking how great it sounds considering that the speaker is so tiny.The overall design is simple and solid. The construction is excellent, as you hold the SoundLink it just screams out ""well built"". Visually I like the design very much, but the look is simple and understated. If you're looking for something flashy, then you might want to look elsewhere. The small form factor makes this really easy to take on the go - you can definitely easily carry it in a backpack or even in your jacket pocket or purse. It is pretty heavy though, much more dense than you'd think by just looking at it. It's a brick!I've paired it with multiple phones and my iPad, and the bluetooth setup has gone off without a hitch. I've moved around the house a bit without losing my connection, but when I walked outside to test the range it did drop connection. One thing to point out, is that I've used bluetooth speakers in the past that seem to just randomly drop the connection from time to time, but the SoundLink hasn't done that to me at all yet. Very refreshing!The battery life has been very good in my tests, lasting around 9 hours before running out of juice on me.The only thing that would prevent me from recommending this product to everyone is that the $200 price tag is fairly steep. If you're looking for a high quality product though, and are willing to spend $200 then I'm sure you'll be very happy with this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKWRLAB8R7BWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WK47VEW#wasThisHelpful","RKWRLAB8R7BWF","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Setting up this NAS is absolutely trivial, WD did a great job making this a quick and easy setup. Within 10 minutes I had everything ready to go, it's really as simple as connecting the network, connecting the power, and then turning it on. Minutes later you'll have an excellent RAID solution all ready to go. I've connected to and used this drive from my Windows desktop and multiple Macbooks - and all of them connected easily and have worked flawlessly so far. Time Machine backups and tons of photos/videos/other data are now living happily in their central, secure location on the WD Red drives (designed for reliability).The control panel for this drive is very extensive and potentially a bit overwhelming. Honestly I haven't tweaked many of the settings, the default setup has been meeting my needs well. I have some experience with the WD MyCloud app in the past, but for my use cases I'm not typically accessing data this way. I've tested it out and it seems to work well, it's just not something that I use often.While not primarily important, I wanted to mention that the physical design of this product is excellent. It's very appealing, clean looking. The drives are easy to access and remove. There is no external display or anything though, just a few blue LEDs. Any diagnostic information has to come from accessing the control panel.One other nice feature of this NAS is that it provides multiple network and power connections for redundancy in case you are interested in hooking up a UPS or something similar. In a small business scenario this is possibly an important feature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DSTMC1AZLELG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URNV93M#wasThisHelpful","R2DSTMC1AZLELG","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This printer is a great choice if you want a basic wireless home printer for documents. If you want a photo printer or a scanner, this is not for you - but if you just want to print then it could be an excellent option. This printer was very easy to set up and is now connected to all of our home computers and laptops over our wireless network. The print quality in both color and black and white is excellent and print outs can be handled immediately with no smudging. The speed is supposed to reach 19 ppm, and it certainly seems to print very quickly.Perhaps the biggest plus compared to our old printer is the large laserjet ink cartridges. They each generate 1400 or more copies (according to the specs - can update later on when we have printed more things), while the small color ink cartridges for our old printer only worked for about 300 pages -- I felt like we were constantly running low on ink and having to change them out, and we don't even use the printer very often.This printer also looks very stylish and I really like the touch-screen display. It runs fairly quietly and goes to sleep automatically when not in use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7R2427JR6NE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S74JAHK#wasThisHelpful","R7R2427JR6NE4","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This iPad keyboard/case has a solid design. The keys are comfortable, and the case offers decent protection while being lightweight. The way the magnets are setup to offer multiple viewing angles is nice, and the magnet strength is surprisingly solid. Everything about the design is excellent, but the problem is that the bluetooth pairing is just not reliable. Sometimes it takes multiple times to pair, and often it just loses the connection randomly in the middle of typing. I tried restarting, enabling/disabling the bluetooth, etc. and nothing seemed to help much. Sometimes the connection stays and the product seems excellent, but it's not reliable. Unfortunate, because this product has great potential.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O7CEG1QGVNBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NWE9ZDE#wasThisHelpful","R2O7CEG1QGVNBC","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These comfortable headphones deliver excellent sound. In fact, when I connected them to my iphone and turned them up all the way, they made pretty good speakers! (They sound way better than the phone's speakers). I can only turn them up a third of the way while wearing them before the music gets too loud for me. When I turn the sound way down, the music is still clear.  The bass is excellent, and the overall sound quality is fantastic. These are not noise-cancelling headphones, but they do a good job of blocking out most sound, while allowing you to hear if you have to. People close to you will also be able to hear your music through the headphones unless it is super quiet.The headphones are adjustable and comfortable. I have a pretty abnormally large head and my ears are big, and often headphones don't fit me well. Not the case with these, they're well-padded and quite comfortable for me to wear. The only potential downside here is that they are are a bit bulky and fairly heavy compared to other headphones I've had, but not enough for this to be a problem for me. Just be aware they're not the kind of headphones that you put on to go for a run and exercise, they're for when you don't mind sacrificing some mobility for excellent sound.They come with two connectors. One has a control on it the cord to stop or start a song on a mobile device or tablet -- very useful! The other is much longer with a coil to help prevent tangles. The headphones also come with a nice, simple carrying bag.Overall, I'm impressed with this product. They're not cheap, but they deliver a high-end experience. Highly recommended if you're looking for a high quality set of speakers and don't mind something a little bulky.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VUA3RPH71GLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9DQOYW#wasThisHelpful","R2VUA3RPH71GLX","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife has an older Macbook Pro from 2011 and it has been running slowly lately. Over the weekend I replaced her hard drive with this SSD and the performance has improved dramatically. Upgrading to an SSD is one of the biggest bang for the buck computer performance improvements, and the different is very noticible. The installation was very quick and easy, it took me around 10-15 minutes to swap out the drives (and a lot of that time was just tracking down the right screwdrivers).The drive itself seems well made and solid, especially given how thin it is. Note that this product does come with a 3.5"" adapter if you're installing it into a desktop, but I was replacing a laptop drive so I didn't use it.Everything about this drive has been great so far, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMBUU44C7ZAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TR05054#wasThisHelpful","R2EMBUU44C7ZAH","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My house was built in the late 70s, and the kitchen faucet had definitely not been updated since then. I spent a few hours today installing this Delta faucet, and it is definitely a huge step up over the 70s special we were running with before! The brushed stainless steel construction is beautiful, the product looks great and whole setup feels high-quality and solid. The short story of this review is that if you like the looks of this faucet, then you'll probably love it. Read on for some more details.A lot of the reviews here mention having plumbers install it for them, but I decided to install mine myself. I'm not great at home improvements, but I do have some experience. Not a total rookie, but far FAR from being a master. If you're a homeowner with a little skill, then you should be able to handle this project.This installation took me a little over two hours to finish, but the majority of that time was spent trying to get the old faucet OUT. This was definitely the hardest part of the process, but after some WD-40 and a little elbow grease I had the old faucet out and ready to replace. The install of the new Delta faucet had a lot of steps, but was very straightforward. Connecting the sink to the hot and cold water was easy enough, but after that there are still a decent number of steps left. There's a battery pack to install, and some wires to run - but none of these steps are really complicated or difficult, just more stuff to do. Pretty easy. After this install, I spent too much time being paranoid and trying to verify that there weren't  any leaks - but everything was good to go and the faucet was working properly.The performance of the faucet is fantastic. The headisn't stainless steel (it's plastic), but it works great. The magnet holds it securely in place, and it switches easily between the different spray modes. Note that this faucet doesn't have a separate ""hose"" (it's built into the main faucet), so if you had an existing spot in your sink for one like me, then you can use that space for a soap dispenser instead. Unfortunately this doesn't come with the faucet, so you'll have to buy one separately.Initially I thought installing a battery pack into my kitchen sink was a little silly, but the Touch2O technology is actually pretty cool. I'm always cooking, and the idea of being able to turn on the faucet without dirtying up the handle due to the raw meat or dough on my hands sounds great to me. I've tested this feature out a bunch, and it works great. There is also a small LED on the front of the faucet that indicates if the water is hot or cold. Honestly I'm not sure what I would use this for, but it's pretty cool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2QREDEF74XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRJALYI#wasThisHelpful","R1L2QREDEF74XV","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was excited to try this toy during bath time with our baby. He's not old enough to use it himself, but I thought it would be fun to show him the water wheel and sieve and funnel.Unfortunately, the water wheel doesn't work very well. I tried pour water over it fast and slow, to the side and in the middle, and I got it to spin a few times, but mostly the water just spilled off to the sides. Too bad because our baby loves watching things spin!I'm giving this three stars because the toy is very well-made, and I like how any combination of the three pieces fits over the base. The sieve was a big hit! The baby loved trying to catch the water falling through. I think this toy would be a lot of fun at the beach, too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H5EI2T1D9Z95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMW3AKS#wasThisHelpful","R2H5EI2T1D9Z95","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a beginner golfer and have used these balls for a round of 18. I got off to an incredible start with the warbirds. The very first hole I played with them was my personal first birdie on a par 4. Unfortunately this magic didn't last for the rest of the round and my game quickly came back down to Earth - but it was definitely not the fault of these warbirds. They seem lively, I was definitely driving the ball a bit farther than I usually do.

"This perfume has a subtle scent that reminded me of water at first. The scent is mostly floral with hints of fruitiness, and it lasts for several hours before fading. My wife has been using it, and we both thing it smells very nice. It's a great product for someone who doesn't like especially strong perfumes. It doesn't smell up an entire room as soon as you spray it. The scent is just strong enough to notice, but not overwhelming or obvious.One downside is the price. It's a lot to pay for a very small bottle of perfume. My wife has other perfumes in the $30-40 range that she likes very much - but the scents are heavier and don't last as long, so even though this one is expensive you are getting a solid product for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F03E02PJN9JN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095OZ854#wasThisHelpful","R2F03E02PJN9JN","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bottom line for this laptop is that it's powerful beast in a very small package. If you want a 13"" laptop capable of running the latest games then it's a great option. It's not cheap, but contains some high quality components.Read on for a lot more detail:OVERALL CONSTRUCTION/BUILDMy first impression on picking up this laptop is how light it is for a gaming laptop. Sure it's only 13"", but I was expecting it to be feel more dense than it does at just around 4.5 pounds. The overall quality of the case is high. I would say that it's not quite as nice as the machined aluminum of a Macbook Pro, but it is light years ahead of some of the cheap plastic-feel laptops I have tried out. It definitely feels 'high quality' in your hands.The design features a glowing blue alien logo on the outside of the screen with a few glowing blue lines on a dark grey background. If you're looking for a ""professional"" looking laptop then this is probably not it, but considering it's branded with an alien theme - it's a lot more subtle than it could be. Personally I like the design.SCREEN This display on this laptop is a gorgeous 3200x1800 screen, and it looks awesome. The Amazon listing says the resolution is 2560x1440 pixels, but this is definitely incorrect - the one I got runs at 3200x1800 out of the box. The screen is bright and clear, and everyting I've tried out has looked great on it. I'm not personally a big fan of touch screens on laptops, but I tried it out for a while and everything I messed around with worked well. One reason I don't like touchscreens much is that I hate putting blemishes on my beautiful screen from oils off of my fingers, but I have to admit that even after using the touchscreen for a while there isn't really any noticible smudging at all. One minor annoyance with the touchscreen is that flicking away a bit of dust on the screen ends up opening up menus or moving my cursor. Not a knock on this specific product at all, just a personal preference.One thing to note is that with the 3200x1800 resolution on a 13"" screen, this laptop scales up content through Windows settings by default. Through ""Display"" -> ""Make text and other items larger or smaller"" the default setting puts the scale up all the way. Most programs handle this scaling well, but it's possible that you will run into one that doesn't (like thie ""Alienware Product Registration"" that pops up, the text is microscopic). This isn't a knock on the laptop, just the reality of running such a high resolution on a smaller screen.KEYBOARDThe keyboard is surprisingly comfortable considering they had to cram it into a 13 inch laptop. The keys feel nice to the touch, and the space is used well. I'm especially happy to see that they found room for page up, page down, home, end, and delete keys. I use these keys often while programming, and I'm glad they're here. So far I've accidentally hit the page up/down keys a little too often, but I just need to get used to the keyboard. The palm rests are smooth and comfortable.There are also lots of customizable keyboard backlight options if that's your thing.TRACKPADThe trackpad on this machine is not very good, it's the biggest negative in my experience with this product. It works alright I guess, but it's not anywhere near as smooth as the one on my Macbook Pro. Given that this is a only 13"" laptop, the trackpad is a good size and fairly comfortable to use - but the texture of the pad is a little rougher than I'd like and this leads to scrolling that's just not completely smooth - the cursor tends to jump and skip a bit as you move it across the screen. Right-clicking is also a little finicky, sometimes I end up left-clicking when I intend to right-click. Gestures work fairly well with one major exception:After setup I installed Chrome and started browsing around the web. The gesture behavior was extremely buggy in Chrome. It almost seemed completely random. Sometimes it would scroll correctly, sometimes it would snap the page to the top or bottom, it would often draw strange rectangles everywhere as I gestured. This behavior did NOT happen in Internet Explorer or Firefox, just Chrome. I tried to resolve it through driver updates but didn't have any luck. After research, it looks like the problem is with Chromium specifically, but I haven't been able to figure out a workaround. Here are two threads that have information on the topic:https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/BdaUw9boNSUhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=463350As a result, I'm not able to use Chrome at all, which is a definite bummer because Chrome is my usual browser of choice. I've been using Firefox and the scrolling works very well, but I'm disappointed I can't use Chrome.SPEAKERSWhen I turned the volume all the way up on this laptop, I was honestly shocked at how loud these speakers are. It is MUCH louder than my 17"" Macbook Pro. The quality is decent, it doesn't compare to a nice Sonos speaker or anything - but it's excellent for a 13"" laptop. Not much bass, but boy are they loud.GAMESIf you're buying this computer then it's highly likely that you're a gamer. I've tried it out on a bunch of different games, I'll talk about them here. The framerates are GENERAL ideas of the fps I was getting, obviously these fluctuate a lot during gameplay. I used MSI Afterburner to get the numbers.Far Cry 4I loaded up Far Cry 4 and it crashed immediately after launching! Bummer! I spent a while on this until I found a random forum post that said that MSI Afterburner causes Far Cry 4 to crash, and sure enough they were correct. Unfortunately that means that I don't have actual fps time data for Far Cry 4. I can tell you that it autodetected 1920x1080 on High, and this was running fairly well - but I scaled it back to Medium and the gameplay was a lot smoother. I'll stick with medium.Fallout: New VegasFallout: New Vegas autodetected 1280x720 on High quality, and it ran at a solid 60 fps. I scaled it up to 1920x1080 at Ultra quality and it ran between 40-60 fps.Civilization VCivilization V is a good example of what I mentioned earlier in the review: Some applications just aren't built to run at such high resolutions. Civ V autodetected 3200x1800 and the main menu was all weird, centered in between big black emptiness in the middle of the screen (Some people talkig about it here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/8930/discussions/0/864980734944032303/). The actual game worked ok though, but only ran at about 12 fps. I scaled the resolution down to 1920x1080 and it went up to about 20-22 fps. Frame rate isn't as important in an RTS as in an FPS, but there you go.The Witcher 2: Assassins of KingsThe Witcher 2 autodetected 3200x1800 at Low quality and ran at about 20 fps. I scaled it down to 1920x1080 and the framerate jumped to 35-50. I upped the quality from low to high and ended up with 22-32 frames per second. I'll also note that The Witcher 2 consistently crashed for me whenver I exited it, not sure why.BENCHMARKSIf you're into benchmarks, I ran a few with this machine right out of the box. I didn't try to optimize these scores at all, they are just what I got with the vanilla machine:3DMarkSky Diver 1.0: 9209Fire Strike 1.1: 3352I also timed reboot, and it was just around 10 seconds. Very fast.BATTERYIt's hard to give information about battery life because tasks vary so wildly, but I just had a battery charge last a little over 4 hours through some web browsing, video watching, and programming.CONCLUSIONI decided to go with 5 stars for this laptop because I think for the correct customer it's an awesome product. I would have given it 4.5 stars if I could due to the lower-quality trackpad discussed above, but I don't feel it's worth taking off a full star for. I've put a lot of information in this review, and I hope it's enough to help you figure out if this is the right laptop for you. If there are any specific questions then leave them in the comments below and I will do my best to respond. I'll also be updating the review in the future as I use the laptop more and more. Best of luck making your decision!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4A9EWXSE1O8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJG8PQ#wasThisHelpful","R4A9EWXSE1O8J","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you like the classic ""Wind in the Willows"" or Kate DiCamillo's ""Because of Winn Dixie"", you'll like this book. The animal characters are as delightful and entertaining as Frog and Toad, but the tone is more modern and the adventures as heartfelt as the search for the dog in Because of Winn Dixie.The story is about three characters: a firefly who wants to fly to the moon, a cricket who wants to play baseball, and a human boy, Peter, who misses his best friend. As they befriend and learn to trust each other, they help each other find what they're all looking for -- despite the fact that Peter's family thinks his bug friends are imaginary, and crickets and fireflies are taught that humans are dangerous.This story is appropriate for boys or girls of any age, and includes 15 full color plates of art as well as small black and white illustrations interspersed with the text. It would be a great choice for a child who starts reading early, and needs a longer or higher-level text beyond the level of early readers. I look forward to reading it with my son.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXQ4KV4JKZ37X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442423366#wasThisHelpful","RXQ4KV4JKZ37X","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This towel is an adorable gift for a baby or toddler. We received several infant towels as gifts, but our baby was growing out of them. This towel is a larger size that fits a baby in 9-month clothes perfectly, with some extra room to spare. The part that covers the head is plenty large to grow into, also.The colors are bright and true to the photo. We haven't washed it yet so not sure how it will hold up.

"My wife is breastfeeding our 4-month-old son now, and thought she'd give these vitamins a try instead of the prenatal vitamin she'd been taking. We didn't realize until we got them that they suggest taking a pill 3x each day. It's hard enough to remember to take them twice a day. She definitely prefers the convenience of her one-a-day prenatal vitamins (CVS generic brand). Plus, it's a lot more economical - these tablets work out to $23 for only 16 days worth of pills.She hasn't had any side effects from this vitamin - no nausea, even when taken on an empty stomach.Here are how some of the key ingredients compare vs. the one-a-day prenatal (if you take this 3x a day)NewChapter-----------------100% Vitamin C - half the amount as generic500% Vitamin D3 - not included in generic235% Thiamin - 2x as much as generic250% Riboflavin - 3x as much as generic400% Vitamin B6 - 4x as much as generic50% Folic acid - half as much as generic500% Vitamin B12 - 5x as much as generic50% Iron - 1/3 as much as generic67% Zinc - about 1/2 as much as genericCalcium & Vitamin A - about the sameExtra stuff only in the NewChapter vitamin:Vitamin K, Biotin, Pantothenic Acid, Selenium, Copper, Manganese, Chromium, Molybdenum, plus Kelp powder, Herbal blend, Black Cumin, and TurmericOur OB suggests taking a prenatal vitamin while breastfeeding, so there doesn't seem to be any medical reason to switch to a postnatal, though some of the amounts are quite different. We also don't buy into the organic and non-GMO attributes of the NewChapter brand, which some people might find important. We're planning to go back to the generic brand once she's done with these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QVBV5OOCVV5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8SBEGE#wasThisHelpful","R3QVBV5OOCVV5C","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our dog has had digestion issues her whole life. We started her out on Taste of the Wild, then switched to Blue Buffalo Basics, but she still regularly had soft stools or diarrhea. We kept having to put her on a bland diet, but didn't want to buy prescription food.We switched her to this Natural Balance Kangaroo & Potato food about two weeks ago, and so far, she's had normal stools. She also loves the food - but then again, she loves any food!The only reason I give this four stars is the price. It costs about $55 for a 22 lb bag. You can get a 24 lb bag of Blue Buffalo for the same price, or a 30 lb bag of Taste of the Wild for about $50. So it's definitely not the most economical choice.Also, the food is really made out of kangaroos, which isn't a negative to me, but I do find it a little bizarre... but hey, why not?","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RLJN66F0PQZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M2IRYQQ#wasThisHelpful","R1RLJN66F0PQZL","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For some context at the start: I'm not a professional electrician or anything, I just do occasional home DIY repairs and hobbyist electrician projects.These are two solid tools. They aren't flimsy or lightweight, they both feel very solid and the hinge is extremely sturdy. The strippers, cutters, and crimpers all do the job well. The one negative that I can point out is that the handles are a bit skinny and will likely be hard on your hands with prolonged use. This also can make working with thicker material difficult.

"My favorite thing about this mat is that it's extra long. I've used many different mats before, and I often wound up with my feet off the end of the mat. I'm 5' 10"", so not super tall, but still - regular sized mats never felt long enough. Also, this mat is made of a material that feels both firm and soft. I can kneel on this mat without any pain, but it's not too squishy to bear weight evenly.The mat rolls up easily and stores well. It's a bit on the heavy side, but I think that's worth it for the length and material. My only complaint is that when new, the mat has a chemical smell to it, but that should fade with use.Also - word of caution - if your dog walks on the mat, the nails will scratch the surface! The scratches don't do major damage to the mat, they just don't look very pretty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BOESBCO0YKL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2PBUZ4#wasThisHelpful","R1BOESBCO0YKL2","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set of blocks caught my eye because it allows for two different type of play. My son will be able to build with the blocks from a young age, and when he gets a little older, he will imagine stories about the different characters and items pictured on the blocks. The art style is cute and colorful, the characters are interesting, and I like the many different sizes and shapes of the blocks. They are made of solid wood, and feel substantial but not too heavy.However, the art painted on the blocks may not last. When our set arrived, the lacquer was already peeling off of the shark block, and I worry that little teeth may quickly ruin the art on many more of the blocks!Also, the picture book included with the set is poorly done. The writing is too advanced for the age of the child who will be using the set, and there is way too much text per page. The text is also badly set on some pages -- it overlaps the art. A good editor could have made the story much better.Despite those two drawbacks, I think this is a delightful gift for a young child, and I can't wait until my son is old enough so we can play with it together!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28A9K43SLZV1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085309DM#wasThisHelpful","R28A9K43SLZV1S","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Unfortunately the cable line in my house is at one end, and our master bedroom is all the way on the other end - as a result I would get spotty wifi access when using a laptop or iPad in the bedroom. I've been thinking about getting a range extender for a while to fix this problem, and the Netgear Nighthawk AC1900 has solved my issue admirably. The bottom line is that the performance of this extender is excellent. The wifi now covers the entire house (and more of the yard) and the connection is excellent.Connecting the Extender to your wifi is very simple if your wifi router supports WPS (which mine did). Basically all you need to do is plug in the Extender close to your router, press the WPS button and the connection should complete. After this, you can unplug the Extender, move it to its permanent location, and plug it back in. You're good to go. I did have one minor problem with the install: I could not get my 5 Ghz wireless network to connect through WPS. The 2.4 Ghz network connected fine, but I had to use the web based setup method. This was straightforward and worked fine, but a bit frustrating because I tried to get it to work through WPS many times before giving up.I don't think the minor install issue is enough to reduce the rating to 4 stars (I'd go 4.5 if I could). Everything else about this product has been great. Highly recommended if this is what you're looking for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QS3YBVERXM8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R92CLD6#wasThisHelpful","R3QS3YBVERXM8M","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are a bunch of lengthy reviews of these headphones, so I'll try to boil it down to a list of pros and cons based on my experience:Pros:- Very comfortable- Solid sound quality. I'm not an audiophile, but these sounds excellent to my uneducated ears.- Excellent packaging.- Independent game/chat volume controls.Cons:- Can't hear yourself talk. I know this may sound obvious for closed headphones/mic combinations, but I had only used open headsets before and it was very disorienting/weird.- Game and chat volumes were tough to balance for me. It was hard to get a mix where I felt I was hearing both at an appropriate level.

"Short Review: Interested in getting current with state of the art neuroscience and some philosophical discussions about our brain and consciousness? If so, read this approachable and easy-to-understand book!Longer Review:Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist with a knack for explaining difficult concepts with simple analogies and clear descriptions. I've been a fan for some years now, and I thoroughly enjoyed Physics of the Impossible, Parallel Worlds, and Hyperspace. I was a bit surprised when I heard that Kaku was extending a bit outside his theoretical physics wheelhouse to write a book about the brain - but I'm very glad I decided to give this one a read.After reading this book I feel like I'm much more up to date with where we currently stand when it comes to state-of-the-art neuroscience. Kaku stresses greatly the avalanche of modern neuroscience progress that was triggered by widespread use of MRI technology starting in the 90s, and this new information is forcing us to confront and redevelop longstanding ideas regarding our brains. A discussion of the various technological developments unlocking this new information leads into some philosophical discussion of consciousness and what makes us 'human'.The bulk of the remainder of The Future of the Mind is focused on how the increase in brain-technology will affect the world, including discussions of telepathy, telekinesis, memory implants, memory recording, potential mental illness cures, brain enhancement, and mind reading. He also discusses different 'types' of consciousness including things like the consciousness of robots and the potential consciousness of alien life forms. The topics covered are very forward thinking, and there is a lot of time devoted to the various ways in which we will likely continue to stride forward in the future (such as the section on reverse engineering the brain). As you can tell this is a huge range of topics, and reading The Future of the Mind it sure sounds like we're just scraping the surface of potential topics with this book. Prepare to feel overwhelmed at how quickly brain science is marching along.Kaku interviewed a huge number of experts in the field of neuroscience, and quotes from their conversations are features prominently throughout. A common pattern in the book is to reveal a shocking-but-true fact or experimental result about our brain accompanied by a metaphor and/or expert quote easing into an explanation that is understandable and clear. This approach works well in general, and keeps the pages turning. I had a hard time putting this book down, and brought it to work to finish during my lunch break. I have a habit of highlighting interesting/important passages whenever I read science books, and practically the entire book was highlighted by the time I was finished by this one!It's hard to come up with any significant negatives for this review, but I have to mention that Kaku's constant movie references grew tiresome for me after a while. Many of the concepts in this book are introduced by way of ""This happened in a movie and now it's happening FOR REAL!"" I understand the benefits of this approach, but I could have used a bit more variety - I felt the technique was overused. Just a minor complaint, but something I noticed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROIJ95GXS57JL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038553082X#wasThisHelpful","ROIJ95GXS57JL","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a pretty cool LED lantern that I keep handy for situations where I need a light and holding a flashlight or wearing a headlamp is inconvenient. It takes 4 D batteries, which is a lot and makes the lantern feel pretty heavy - but it produces a very bright light. The construction is solid, and the rubber side seems to be quite durable.This lantern does the basics well, but also has a few cool features. There's an auto-shutoff feature that will hopefully save you some batteries if you forget to shut if off. It's possible to position the lantern upside down and shine the light downwards. There's also a USB charging port. I'm not sure how long the batteries will last in this mode, but it's a great option for emergency situations if you really need to charge your phone or whatever.If this type of lantern is something in the market for, then you should be very satisfied with this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NDKMC84VCP43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ6L7DO#wasThisHelpful","R1NDKMC84VCP43","A12JARSR16QM21","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12JARSR16QM21?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I cannot give a high star review on these because of my experience. The pills are very small and ofcourse are not coated, but I have never had an experience like this.I put one on my tongue and was about to drink it down with water, but it started instantly disentigrating and broke in half. When I drank my water, one half slid back and somehow lodged itself in my throat, and I had a very severe choking attack. The pills are very bitter, and that made it worse. I was choking so severely, and my kids didnt know what to do. It went on for a very long time, while I kept trying to drink water, but that tiny half stayed stuck in my throat and would not budge somehow.After a long while, most of it went down and I stopped coughing so hard.Now my older son also had taken one and did not have a bad experience, which is why I am not giving this a lower rating. It helped him sleep, so I was at least glad for that.I would just suggest being really careful, maybe it would have been better to pop it to the back of my throat and drink water at the same time, I have never had a problem with any pill doing it the way I did, so I never thought I would have to use a special method.But I have been too scared of going through that again to try twice!Product provided for my opinion and review","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P0QXFGWBV2B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVZ5KRM#wasThisHelpful","R2P0QXFGWBV2B1","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"LOOOOVE this dress!It conforms to my shape and flatters ALL my curves.It does run small, so I ordered a size larger than normal (I am a 2X and ordered a 3X), and found the fit very flattering.Since I have kind of a large belly area, I wore some shapewear underneath because the dress is so clingy..almost a sweater dress the way it fits.It is SUPER sexy and really shows off the booty :PThe length is a couple inches above my knees (I am 5'6), so it's easy to sit down in without it rolling up.The shoulders do roll up, but I pinned mine down and that worked pretty well. The lower you pull them down, the better they stay that way!The material is lightweight which makes this dress great for every season, and in Winter just throw on a nice sweater or shrug over top and you're ready to go.Looks great with a sexy pair of heels, or even flats or low heels.Overall gorgeous and I highly recommend!*Provided for my opinion and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GJL0S1PHJ9QG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCJ3VZ0#wasThisHelpful","R3GJL0S1PHJ9QG","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very pretty and detailed cherry necklace!the chain is gold tone, and cherries are very realistic and bright and colorful.A bit much for me as I am very minimalist with my jewelry, but I thought it would make a lovely gift for my mother,who is more of a costume jewelry fan.All the cherries seem to be attached well, and all were in place when it arrived.Comes in a lovely gift box, great for storing for yourself or to give as a gift (As I am doing!) to someone special.Also has a nice velvety bag to keep your necklace in, which is a very nice touch also.I did find it a little short for me, but it is adjustable to a longer length.

"This filigree leaf design crystal hair accessory is so beautiful!Especially in lovely lighting which really sets off the crystals!My older daughter is getting married at the end of the year, so I wanted to get this for her.Since she is not here right now, I tried it out on my younger daughter's hair, and as you can see it is just stunning!I was not sure at first how to attach it, but I think I did a decent job in the end, by attaching the smaller comb in front on the side, and the larger end around back on the other side.I think it doesn't always lay flat, so might need to find some clear pins just to make it stay better on the back, but aside from that this is just perfect!It also comes in a lovely gift box with a velvet bag to easily carry, or to store it in as a keepsake.Just gorgeous!*Provided for my opinion and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ELWW2RQCS1ET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QWBRGU8#wasThisHelpful","R2ELWW2RQCS1ET","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This awesome bag far exceeded my expectations!Not only FAR nicer than it even looks in the photos, it comes with a smaller bag inside which I wasn't even expecting!Made from faux leather, I am actually surprised at how great the quality is. This is not some thin, crappy quality material, but rather a heavier, nicer material that you can count on not to rip or catch on objects.The skull print is fantastic, and the silky material skull scarf is an AWESOME accessory to either tie on as shown in the photo, or wear in your hair, tied around your arm, or whatever you like to do with it.The metal chains are another great addition, making any outfit looks super punked out, especially if you are wearing a black and silver outfit (As I often am).  The chain straps are long enough to wear over your shoulder if you choose, or just carry in your hand as I prefer.This is a really cool bucket style bag, and Inside there is LOTS of room in the main compartment, plus it has a zipper pocket and a pocket for a cell phone, keys or whatever you may need.Super cool and trendy and I LOVE!Provided for my opinion and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G6Q1ULAP244X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7Q5KDW#wasThisHelpful","R1G6Q1ULAP244X","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do love this cake pop maker!It is so extremely easy to use and very fast as well.They cake pops are smaller than I expected, but excellent for a little treat to serve at a party, or for your own little snack :)I used a cake mix, and simply took a tablespoon measuring spoon, filled each one almost to the top with one spoon, and was done in just a couple of minutes! Although I was worried that they were overfilled (they began cooking immediately and overflowed the cups), it was fine and once cooked I just took a knife and popped them out of the cooker to cool, leaving behind the extra cooked batter with no problem.I actually used the stand to cool them and decorate them on. I had an issue with the sticks where my cakes slid down, so I ended up not using them. It may be the texture of the particular mix I used, maybe it was too thin? But it really didn't matter to me, we just popped them in our mouths straight from the stand. And they were so YUM! Cooked PERFECTLY within just a minute, they were light and crisp (in a great way), and we all loved them!This is so easy to use, we can make pops every day if we like. I also bought a muffin mix to try out, although I haven't yet. I think it would make excellent breakfast pops!I am no chef, so my decoration may look like a toddler did it haha..but believe me they TASTE great!*Provided for my opinion and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X7K12L3RZ4FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SQ9F1U#wasThisHelpful","R1X7K12L3RZ4FG","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This bag is SO PRETTY!The color is lovely. It's a somewhat deep, medium pink that really POPS, making this a wonderful accessory to really stand out if for instance you wear a striking black outfit, or whatever color you might choose to wear with it. It would also complement a dark ""shark"" grey especially well.The hardware is very securely attached and classy looking, with nicely sized carry straps that are comfortable to hold as well as attractively enhancing the bag itself. The straps are also very securely attached, and there are no loose threads anywhere, no pulls or bad spots. VERY quality bag.Inside there is an attachable shoulder strap for those that prefer to carry it on the shoulder, but you don't have to use that unless you prefer it.Inside, there are two main compartments,  plus a center zippered compartment, one inside side pouch which is great for cell phones or keys,and then a side zippered pouch great for change and odds and ends.This bag is SO roomy, without being huge and unattractive. Instead, it is the perfect size with the perfect amount of room for me to keep all my goodies inside! I have my brush, compact, lip glosses, wallet, tissues, mints, etc etc. all fitting nicely inside, and easy to find due to the amount of room.REALLY REALLY pretty and I love it!*Provided for my opinion and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18FJZHGFULPHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U4QTJD4#wasThisHelpful","R18FJZHGFULPHU","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This  speaker really blew me away!I have tested a wide variety of bluetooth speakers, and this one REALLY stands out.FINALLY some stunning, booming bass! Now to be fair, the others I have enjoyed using have nice bass. But this one tops all of them on overall sound quality, and especially the bass.I was listening to music and turned around for just literally a minute and I heard a crash behind me. I had placed the speaker about midway back on my countertop (which is fairly far back), and it actually bounced itself off the counter and fell on the floor!I was open-mouthed on that one haha :) So I would just say, make sure you have it securely placed when listening to a heavy bass infused song!I love that I was able to use it right away. and it holds a charge for a good long time. I am still using it days later without having charged it again!This little dynamo has the sound of a much larger sound system, and that's even without turning it all the way up.I have used it successfully with my laptop and my android phone, but for some reason it did not seem to work with my Kindle Fire.Luckily, it comes with an audio cord so you can hook it directly to your device in case the device is not bluetooth compatible.The small size makes this very portable, and it comes in a nice little case that makes it even easier to carry around, whether in your car, backpack, or wherever you like. This is fantastic for the parties we have at our house (and at the park), because it provides fantastic sound in a small package.This was so easy to use that I didn't even need the instructions at all.ABSOLUTELY love it!!!!Provided for my opinion and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16APWP5RFMQFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012FJNXIE#wasThisHelpful","R16APWP5RFMQFV","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has such a pleasant scent!I read through the list of uses and it sounded like it would be multi-useful, so I had to give it a try. I get fairly frequent headaches, and often use peppermint oil on my temples which is helpful, but the scent can be a bit strong and overpowering for me.This is a much lighter, pleasant scent and I tried it on my temples the same way I use peppermint.  My headache was just a mild one, but did ease fairly quickly after use. That was actually the first day I got this, so I have not had any other headaches since then and can't say if it will work every time!It feels very light on the skin, as opposed to heavier oils that may make your skin feel a little greasy.Small size bottle makes it easy to stash wherever you may need it so it's available whenever you want it.I think it seems a little light so I don't know if it is diluted or not, but as I said, I do like the non greasy feel!*provided for my opinion and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R337QLDGLV0Q6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AMFDM8U#wasThisHelpful","R337QLDGLV0Q6D","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Super Cool!!!My son is a huge Zelda fan, so I knew he would love this for his car keys.When it arrived, I realized it is much larger than expected. Almost better to display on a desk, or use for other reasons.The sword comes out a little to easily, and there is no way to secure it inside the sheath, so for this reason my son is not going to use it as a keychain, but instead wants to either hang it from the rearview in some way, or make a little stone and secure it to his dashboard with the sword stuck inside, ala Zelda. The size really is great for display more than anything else.But the quality is super nice, and any Zelda fan would love the stone.

"I should mention first that I am undiagnosed ..but I have all the symptoms of sleep apnea, and my father and mother both had it.I wake up many times a night all night, and never sleep well ever.I tried a machine before, but having things coming out of my nose and air going in and out just bothered me too much.I have also been using sleep aids to help, but I digress.These are  various sizes, and I found what seemed a good size and tried it. Unfortunately for me, I was uncomfortable even though they are fairly soft. I did use them for several nights to make sure and test them out well.

"I have been using facial brushes like this one since it was recommended to me to help my rosacea.This one works well and I love that it's waterproof so I can use it while bathing as well.The different brushes are easily interchangeable, and are good for both face and body. I love the extra attachments, especially the pumice stone so that I can use it on my knees, elbows, and feet!The brushes are both soft enough to not agitate the skin, but also stiff enough to get rid of the dead skin well.There is just one speed, which is really ok since with my other brush system I only used the lower speed anyway.This is great for helping me skin, especially my face!

" 1:55 Mins I have tried a variety of 7 inch tablets in the last year, in varying price ranges.This Aoson Quad core tablet is pretty impressive, especially in comparison with one I recently tried out, which had an odd display that was rather hard to look at for any length of time. I actually quite like the display quality on this (Display Technology: TFT Capacitive Touch Screen,Display Resolution: 800 x 480 pixels ), which to me is visually appealing and does not strain my eyes.It arrived very securely wrapped in layers of bubble wrap inside a very sturdy box (also great for storing the tablet in).This budget tablet is surprisingly strong in most major areas that I look for : Display quality, storage expandability(up to 32 GB), ease of use, and app availability.Photo quality is good, but if you are looking for high res top quality images, you would need to spend a bit more money.With a front and rear camera, you can easily take quick photos to share with friends.Sound is good, and for even better sound just plug in a good pair of headphones of your choice.As I showed in the video, everything is very easy to figure out and use. To change the default browser homepage which (at least on mine) is set to a foreign language page, simply click the dots at the top right of the browser page and click general> settings > set default homepageand put it on the page of your choice.I really loved how easy this was to use, without even having to read any instruction. If you have an android phone or other android tablets, you can just pick this up and begin using right away, as everything is laid out in the usual familiar way.Lightweight but clearly made of quality materials, this tablet is a great budget choice for anyone who wants something basic yet feature filled, or for your kids to watch videos and surf the web, or play music on.*Provided for my opinion and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W8J7MBR536CE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WW00HKY#wasThisHelpful","R2W8J7MBR536CE","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great info on not just WHAT to spiralize, but WHY.It never occurred to me that my spiralizer is valuable not just for convenience, but to help me and my family eat better.The intro states that  aside from doing this for your picky eaters in the household, those who out of health needs should have a low fat diet can creatively transform veggies and fruits into more appealing meals for themselves and the whole family.Also stated: Creating spiralized noodles made out of fresh veggies provides a healthy and gluten free option for those with gluten sensitivity.There are some really good recipes that I am excited about, including the Beef Stroganoff (made with yellow squash), chicken biryani, and the spaghetti, to name a few.I am just thrilled that I started reading this, because I freely admit, I am not big on veggies (at least not a wide variety), and this creative book really inspires me.*Provided for my opinion and review","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R137STBHRT85XF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623156025#wasThisHelpful","R137STBHRT85XF","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has some good recipes listed, although not a lot that I was too excited about.However, given the fact that I have major stomach issues, beggars can't be choosers! We have to eat what is best for our bodies.Having said that, I did find some recipes that did appeal to me, such as  potato pancakes, smoothies, veggie chips, chinese chicken, and some others.I did find the information listed about IBS and eating to soothe the gut helpful and much needed in my case.

I normally would wear a XXL, but went ahead and got these in 3X and they are a nice comfy fit.I also was worried about how I would look in flared pants, but love how fashionably chic these are.The fabric is just super soft, stretchy, and allows you to move around or ""flow"" around more accurately.I doubt there is anything more comfortable you could wear to do yoga, excercise, or anything else.The material is quality with no loose threads.

"Oh no, just NO.I am a huge acoustic fan, but just no.I couldn't get past the first few songs, even though I wanted to LOVE this.So, ofcourse we all would prefer the original bands doing their own acoustic versions, but sometimes covers can be outstanding as well.But sadly, most of these are not even good cover performers. If I heard some of these performers in a coffee shop, I would have to discreetly walk out.Like I'm doing now...3, 2 , 1 (tiptoes away)EDIT (8/1) Since I did stop listening after the 4th song, I am going to go back and at least try to listen to the others to see if there is anything worthwhile on here. The good news is: I found a few that I actually enjoyed! I liked ""Sugar"" , ""What the World Needs Now"" , ""Congratulations"",and there were a few more I didn't hate, but you really wouldn't find me listening to them again or putting them on my playlist.The majority of these songs, either I didn't like the song itself, or I didn't like the voice. And in some cases both!There are actually some good voices on here, and ofcourse some well-known singers and bands (Five for Fighting, Michelle Branch, Josh Rading) mixed in with the lesser known (or not known at all).Overall you have some very sleepy, relaxing tracks that you might hear in an elavator, or just something you might enjoy to put on to relax. Nothing wrong with that if that is what you are looking for, but if you are expecting a well put together album of music that you can sing along to or even recognize, then this probably isn't it.I have edited this review and added a star based on a few good tracks that I enjoyed, and even a few that are really good, but just not for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SCIT4ID9GIW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Q8R7DG#wasThisHelpful","R1SCIT4ID9GIW9","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cardigan is a must have for Fall and Winter! I was happy to put it on once I felt how soft the fabric is. I felt like a cloud was giving me a hug! LOL :)The  wonderful thing about products in Charlie a Go-Go line is that they all match and go together, so you can take them and switch fashions around  to expand your wardrobe without spending a lot of money.I find that fashions like these are worth paying extra for, because the quality is very high, the fabric soft, slimming, and comfortable, as well as much more suited to last a long time after washing, etc.The arms on this really ARE slimming...I was so pleasantly surprised by this, given my arms are pretty big at the top. Since the largest this comes in right now is a just a little small on me, I was not sure, but it actually fits quite well and does have a nice stretch to the fabric..Again, cleverly designed to slim down where it needs to, this is really flattering for my body type, and I feel safe saying it would flatter any body type,I paired mine with this tummy tank listed here:Charlie a Go-Go Women's Tummy Tank 12 French VanillaHighly recommended!(provided for my opinion and review)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IF0OFKC56SZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UGOLYGY#wasThisHelpful","R3IF0OFKC56SZE","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am super happy with this fantastic ""tummy"" tank top!It looks so lovely on the model here, that I hoped it would also flatter my body type (with a much rounder belly!).It arrived very nicely packaged, and upon removing it from packaging, I immediately noticed how soft the fabric is!  The fabric is lightweight without being too thin, yet heavy enough that it will work great layered under shrugs, sweaters, etc in cooler weather. Right now it's very hot here in FL, and this works great for me!Also, The hem is tightly sewn and does not have any loose threads.This Charlie a Go-Go tank comes in three colors, and I chose the Orchid shade, which is exactly the shade shown in the photo, so be assured the color is very accurate! I love this color A LOT, and would love to get the other two colors as well, to round out my Fall wardrobe.I feel that worn with a nice shrug or cardigan, such as the gorgeous matching cardigans they have HERE: Charlie a Go-Go Women's Plus-Size Cardigan Cover Up, this is perfect to wear to work in the office, or out on the town with a pair of heels.As mentioned, it is super soft, and the ruching very cleverly hides your belly (if you have one you want to slim down). I was actually worried that it might have the opposite effect of highlighting that area, but instead it tricks the eye and flatters more than you can imagine until you try it yourself.The straps are fairly wide, so that you don't need to wear a strapless bra, you can wear your nicest uplift with this and it does wonders! :)Beautiful and quality, absolutely love!(provided for my opinion and review.

" 0:39 Mins I love this tank!From the silver embossed logo on the inside (which I am the only one who sees it, but I love it every time I look at it), to the gorgeous shades available (I chose the gorgeous royal blue one), this cami/tank is wonderful.Although this is referred to as a maternity tank, I am not pregnant, but I am plus sized, and a size 18. This fits me perfectly, stretches where I need it to, yet retains it's shape. It should cling to almost any size, and allow room to grow!My favorite thing besides the color is how incredibly SOFT it is. It honestly feels like wrapping your skin in a soft cloud. Normally only sleepwear is this soft, so I absolutely adore it. And by the way, it also WOULD make a nice sleep cami as well!You can layer this tank under other tops, wear with a shrug thrown over, or wear it alone in the Summer to be more comfortable in the heat.The straps are very thin, which I like because it feels so light on my skin. While it flatters the bosom, it's still enough coverage not to have anything falling out the top! :)Beautiful and versatile, this is a real winner for my closet!*Provided for my opinion and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL7A3IDDJWDMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLESBHM#wasThisHelpful","RL7A3IDDJWDMN","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I love that in this hot weather we are having here in Florida.It feels nice and cool against the skin, and the ends are sewn well, with no hanging threads, even after a few washes.Just adding this three piece set to my bed has changed the entire look, and I love adding this gorgeous color to my room decor!*Product provided for my opinion and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9WDFH2T5B77N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZAUW74C#wasThisHelpful","R9WDFH2T5B77N","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again, SO much nicer than I even expected!This soft and supple messenger/camera bag is a lovely retro dark brown, and harkens back to years ago, with a delightfully retro look.Although it says in the description that the leather may have an odor due to not being chemically treated, but I did not notice a scent and I am extremely sensitive to smells normally.The leather is very soft and pleasant to the touch..as well as visually. This bag can be used in a wide variety of ways. It has the soft, cushioned inner compartments for camera equipment, or you can use those compartments for other items, or not at all! I was looking inside and thought it would be great as a carry-all to the office, with more than enough room for tablets, snacks, phones..even a small change of clothes!It seems like there are pockets and compartments and places to store things EVERYWHERE in this bag, while still being lightweight enough to carry around frequently. The inner , padded camera caddy is removable and slides right out, allowing you to easily access your equipment once you get to your location, or just allowing you to leave it at home and use the bag for notebooks, paperwork and tablet etc.On the interior on the front panel are slots to secure your cell and keys as well.The padded caddy has three compartments separated by velcroed portions, and each velcroed portion is easily removable to give even more space for your equipment, should you require it.I found all the materials to be super soft, easily maneuverable, very very high quality, and beautifully appealing to the eye.There is also a long carry strap included that you can attach to the rings on the sides should you wish to.The straps secure tightly and work well, though I generally prefer a zipper closure which I find faster to open. Still, no complaints here, this retro leather bag is gorgeous and a great find!*Provided for my opinion and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XVOLO3KYS8Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWAPMYE#wasThisHelpful","R1XVOLO3KYS8Z2","A8JGNKPOC1DU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8JGNKPOC1DU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The plot was slow to start, but within a few chapters I was sucked in.All in all, this new cozy has the making for a fine series!I don't like to give away story lines or plots in reviews, but this book takes place in a small town, when Poly (short for Polyester) inherits the families abandoned material store & murder takes place.Not only is there a new murder as soon as Poly arrives in town, but she also is trying to solve the murder of her great-aunt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R117OLS73SL2N6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJXV198#wasThisHelpful","R117OLS73SL2N6","A1M04H40ZVGWVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M04H40ZVGWVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this series, as well as the ""dead-end job series"", so I was thrilled when this book arrived. At first I was uncomfortable because as I started reading I realized this book did have a plot that dealt with animal abuse. But Elaine Viets wrote this book in such a, well.. Cozy way that even I (a die hard animal lover) didn't have an issue with it.The story line itself was very engaging and entertaining, and I loved the character progression.This is a series you can pick up in the middle and not be lost - although you'll love it so much you'll want to start the series from book 1!If you've been following the series, a lot of things happen with Josie, Jane and Amelia - so it's not just about a murder to solve. Underage drinking, peer pressure is also addressed. Making the book much more ""real life"".All in all this was a great read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ABRDBYR7ZB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451465989#wasThisHelpful","R14ABRDBYR7ZB1","A1M04H40ZVGWVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M04H40ZVGWVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It does work (basically the same as miracle gel), my only issue is the spray top.

"About 20 years ago I was hooked on all things Clinique, and used this body butter religiously. My one beef was that it was in a jar. For whatever reasons I began exploring other options and left my Clinique world. Well, many lotions later  (Flash forward to 2014) and low and behold I find deep comfort body lotion in a bottle here on Amazon! With a pump no less! Made my day :)However, after 20 years of lotion trial and error I found that this product isn't what I once thought it was. The smell was chemical-y and I found it I unappealing, the lotion was heavy and slow to absorb into my skin.I don't think this is a knock off product or anything, I just thing that after 20 years I discovered better products than this and going back to it was a huge disappointment.I will give all you ladies a heads up - when I was pregnant the lady at the Clinique counter swore that applying this daily would help prevent stretch marks....

We meet again, some characters from her previous story, Bridget, Ronan, Anna. In this one, we meet Duncan, a warrior, devastated by the ravage done by the Berwick massacre resulting in the death of his best friend.

Will they share the same feelings? Will Duncan be able to forget the past and forgive himself? Will Brenna discover his secret? Will the clans finally be united? I fell in love with her two main characters Duncan and Brenna! I also liked her secondary characters that brought a touch of their own stories nicely blended into this fantastic journey. Their love scenes are filled with tenderness and passion. Beautiful stormy chemistry between the two that will keep you captivated until the end. Will I strongly recommend HIGHLAND THUNDER, a breathtaking Scottish historical romance as I love them!

If you recall, Bridget holds the key to the Witch of Dervaig suspense, and at the end, will divulge her secret!Because this author is a very talented writer, this novel was a delight to read, it's very well written with some touch of humor. I was not disappointed, I truly recommend it, I also suggest that you read her first two books To Bewitch a Highlander then Highland Thunder. It's a marvelous Scottish adventure to get trapped in!

This running fanny pack allows me to go for a run and forget about holding my phone or keys in my hand when I'm running.  The fanny pack can be adjusted to fit different size waists and can be worn snug or loosely. The belt is stretch and helps create a perfect comfortable fit.

Until they come up with one or I can afford a car that already does it this is a perfect option  to use your hands free function will still being able to see your phone for GPS routes , song selection or anything else.I have brought a few items from Anker and this is the first item I have been contacted on by them to do a review.

" 3:28 MinsI ordered this speaker after I received the Anker cube speaker because my wife loved the cubed speaker so much  I had to basicaly pry it from her hands everyday. I ordered this speaker for her because it was $20 cheaper and had overall good reviews.This review will be more of a camparisson between this speaker and the cube speaker which are both made by anker. Hopefully this helps for people who are on the fence about which anker speaker to buy.Both speakers are a great buy and this speaker is like the little brother to the cubed speaker. Both speakers deliver excellent sound for the size but the cubed speaker deliver a deeper fuller sound.This speakers is great for a office, dorm room and for personally use. It does not get lound enough to to deliver a good sound while outside if there is alot of outside noise but for personall use this is perfect.The cubbed speaker came with a little travel bag but this one dosent.I saw a few reviews about the speaker having the annoying voice promt but the once I recieved did not have any voice promts. I think Anker actually read the reviews and made the changes.$20 for this travel speaker is perfect and sounds better than many speakers in its class. If you are debating between the cubed speaker and this speaker it call comes down to how much you want to spend.I think both are great buys.Check back on my reivew for a video post showing the difference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KCAJTVQR887P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EURJAKK#wasThisHelpful","R3KCAJTVQR887P","A28DSJZSE1L6P6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28DSJZSE1L6P6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"update Jan 9th 2015, the clip the holds the camera in place broke. Now I have a worthless paper weight. I only used the tripod five times and I was always delicate with it. It is the cheap plastic that some of the parts are made with that can give out with minimal wear and tear that will leave this product worthless.I am far from a camera expert but I have a Nikon p510 and wanted a nice affordable tripod to take pics and record videos with. I was surprised at the quality of this tripod, it seems very sturdy and while suite my needs just fine. This tripod is a little heavier than the more expensive tripods but for the price I can't complain. The most expensive models tend to be made with lightweight materials like carbon or basalt fiber but for me aluminum works for what I need. I recommend this tripod to anyone who wants a budget tripod.I feel the instructions that comes with this tripod should be more in depth.Over all Great Buy","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LP3DPS4O3W16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZGLM5W#wasThisHelpful","R3LP3DPS4O3W16","A28DSJZSE1L6P6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28DSJZSE1L6P6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dont choose a running shoe based solely on appearance. Find out what type for runner you are and buy shoes accordingly. Im a neutral runner and these shoes have provided me with excellent support while running. The shoes feel a little heavier than a few shoes I have tried on but they are comfortable. I take a lot of time to buy running shoes because every step you take lands with a blow to your feet, and your shoes should be able to protect your feet and to prevent any injuries. These shoes are a great buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NQRZA0460OKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CKZLNE#wasThisHelpful","R1NQRZA0460OKH","A28DSJZSE1L6P6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28DSJZSE1L6P6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The keyboard and case is a great budget alternative to the ones made by apple.I use brought this keyboard and case because I will be traveling a lot and wanted to be able to send email on the go.The keyboard takes a little getting use to because it is smaller than the normal keyboard but it works great. The case makes it a little harder to use the ipad as just a tablet because the keyboard does not sit flat against the back of the ipad. The case does provide good protection to your ipad and clicks into place snugly so there won't be any accidental drops form the ipad falling out of the case.The beset feature to me is the way this keyboard case holds the ipad like a computer when your typing, you feel as if your on a small laptop.I recommend this case and keyboard if you need a keyboard but if you will be rarely use the keyboard it don't know if I would use this case all of the time because it makes it harder to use the ipad normally.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXV7MNLO0Q2QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AR0M7ZE#wasThisHelpful","RXV7MNLO0Q2QH","A28DSJZSE1L6P6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28DSJZSE1L6P6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The shoes are stylish but I didnt agree with the functionality of the shoes. The shoes are suppose to be comfortable water shoes but the cute out holes in the bottom of the sole cut into your feet. I wore these shoes without socks to the beach and I could barely walk because the little holes felt as if they were cutting into my foot. The holes also let in a lot of debris like rocks or small sticks that never want to come out.If you plan on using these shoes not on the water you have to worry about every small puddle on the around because the holes easily let water .I had to return these shoes after one day of barely walking around because they were so uncomfortable.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10IZQ1NCR6841/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098G0JE4#wasThisHelpful","R10IZQ1NCR6841","A28DSJZSE1L6P6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28DSJZSE1L6P6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I am not taking this for weight lossI take it to control blood pressure and insomnia and I am very pleased with the results.

Some people breathe in (inhale) forskolin powder for asthma. Forskolin drops are used in the eyes to treat glaucoma.5. Forskolin stimulates the production of AMP (cAMP)  This is a molecule that actually creates the making of a thyroid hormone which a powerful body fat and calories burner. This sends your metabolism into overdrive and produces more energy which lasts you all day.6. The Forskolin 100% Pure Extract 250 mg by BioGanix is Standardized to 20% and is 250mg per servingThe recommended dose is of only 1 capsule every day.

"Wet Silence: Poems about Hindu Widows by Sweta Srivastava Vikram is a heart touching and inspiring collection of poems written by Hindu widows from India. In the Hindu culture, when a woman loses her husband, she cannot remarry, she has to wear white saris, and she also can't eat certain foods anymore. This is a collection of poems depicting some of the most intimate emotions a woman can muster. Some of the widows miss their husbands dearly, while others are happy to be free of their abuser. The emotions are profound, heart wrenching,  yet beautiful. These women are not telling their story to ask for help, though, they simply and only break their Silence and allow their most inner voices to be heard. Beautiful, painful, and raw!Wet Silence: Poems about Hindu Widows by Sweta Srivastava Vikram is a book that will easily touch many readers, young and adult, women and men...*Book was provided for free in exchange for unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F6OAB86J6LU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1615992561#wasThisHelpful","R3F6OAB86J6LU9","A2GMYM5TN33X3V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GMYM5TN33X3V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Each box has 5M/16.4 feet of pH paper that can be used with both urine and saliva. It comes in a nice small plastic roll so you can throw it in your purse. The pH paper can accurately be used to also test drinking water, pool water, hot tubs, hydroponic systems, aquariums, food, and even coffee. For saliva as well as urine just wait 15 seconds, then you can read the results by comparing the color of the paper against the indicator chart on the roll.*Product was provided for free in exchange for unbiased and honest review :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26IYGOV0KWGD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z46VAMW#wasThisHelpful","R26IYGOV0KWGD1","A2GMYM5TN33X3V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GMYM5TN33X3V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"1. This stuff is amazing...The Bentonite Clay comes from deposits of volcanic ash and it is one of the most effective detoxifying agents available and has been recognized as such for centuries by native peoples around the world. The first recorded use of medicinal clay occurred in 2500 B.C. in Mesopotamia!2. The clay absorbs toxins such as heavy metals, free radicals, pesticides, etc. Bentonite clay has a negative electrical charge, attracting positively charged molecules. Because most toxins are positively charged, clay naturally rids the body of toxins as it pulls and holds on to the toxins.3. Bentonite Clay is known to help with external skin issues such as skin rashes, cuts, eczema, blemishes, burns or insect bites by applying a paste of water and clay. Leave on the mixture on the skin until it dries off.4. You can make a skin poultice by putting a handful of clay in a thick layer on the skin and keeping a wet cloth over the clay. You need to keep changing the poultice every 2 hours; it helps with burns, cuts, springs and bites.5. To create a face mask, mix Bentonite clay and water and apply this mix to the face as a mask. Leave on this mask for approximately 20 minutes and then wash it off...This is one of my favorite facial masks...it cleans, it detoxifies and it heals :) This mask is excellent for shrinking pores, tightening and toning skin.6. Bentonite mixed in the bath water is excellent for a relaxing and detoxifying bath...7.

If you are looking for a good energy, strength and endurance booster this supplement works wonders!!! Creatine is responsible for making Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the energy utilized by muscle fibers during physical exertion. As ATP levels are depleted, muscles become fatigued and levels of lactic acid increase. Creatine improves stamina and decreases muscle recovery time.

You get L-arginine from the diet and it is needed in the body to make proteins...To build muscle mass you need proteins...so L-arginine is perfect to be used before and after workouts...it not only increases your stamina, it will also build muscle faster and better5. Research has also shown that L-Arginine enhances testosterone, increasing blood flow and sexual desire as well as boosting sensitivity in both men and women. It has been used for male infertility and erectile dysfunction6. L-Arginine is also useful in treating wounds, most especially in people who are suffering from malnutrition, chronic health problems and severe burns because it helps the body make proteins.7.

"I highly recommend The WearMax Hardwood Scratch Concealer. :) I found it really cool that this product actually came with a scratched piece of hardwood, so I can try the concealer before I use it on my floors. I tested the product on the sample, and it was impressive - the white scratches quickly became barely visible!!! After being satisfied with the results I got on the sample hardwood piece, I used the concealer on my living room floor. The floor had a few scratches from several months ago, but even though the scratches were old, I got great results!!!

"1. The Life Glow Probiotics Supplement contains healthy viable bacteria to repopulate your gut and ensure optimal digestive health! These probiotics work really well and I have never experienced any side effects from themI believe I owe it to probiotics that my health is very good :)2. Why and how it works? Probiotics work because 80% of your immune system is in your gut, and when probiotics (the good guys) are abundant in your body, its harder for the disease causing bacteria (the bad guys) to settle in. The Life Glow Probiotics Supplement restores beneficial bacteria for optimal digestive and immune health, helps control yeast and candida overgrowth and promotes daily relief from allergies, gas, bloating and constipation. Probiotics also help create a microenvironment inside your digestive system that promotes full mineral absorption so you can finally feel full of energy again!!!3. The Life Glow Probiotics Supplement comes in a small, easy to swallow capsule that you only need to take once or twice a dayThe bottle contains 60 vegetarian capsules  enough for 60 days of therapy.4.

"1. I love the 1-4-All Peel by The Skin Regime because it is a better and cheaper alternative for the expensive chemical peel you get at the doctor's office :)2. It works really well as long as you follow the detailed instructions you can find in the book The Skin Regime: Boot Camp for Beautiful Skin that you can find on Amazon, also. Here is my experience with it: I first cleaned my face, then I applied some Vaseline around the eyes, lips and nostrils for protection. I put the 1-4-All Peel by The Skin Regime  on the face with a cotton ball and left in place for 2 minutes. Washed my face with the baking soda mixed in water (3 parts water, 1 part baking soda), then applied some hyaluronic acid that I had around. For the next 2 days my face was red and I guess the acid was doing his thing...After 3 peels, I can see amazing results: no more blackheads, pores are small again and my entire face look clear and healthy :) The peels really do amazing things to your complexions!!3. The peel is great for acne, acne scars, wrinkles, large pores, blackheads, oily skin, psoriasis, razor Bumps and even warts :)4.

"I highly recommend the Bark Collar by Our K9. :) This is the perfect gadget to train your sweet pet to stop certain unwanted behaviors. I have used it with my German Sheppard for his bad habit of barking at everything, especially squirrels.

This is not a shocking collar, however, it effectively uses vibration and sounds to stop the barking. I never got to use the high vibrating levels on my dog because the middle intensity ones did the trick. The collar comes with one battery and two different size prongs.

The few age spots that I started showing are almost gone now2. This cream is a complex blend of several organic ingredients, each with its own benefits and properties. The Glycolic Acid (AHA) brightens skin. The willow bark/salicylic acid (BHA) gets rid of blackheads and whiteheads, exfoliates, and stimulates healthy collagen production. The Kojic Acid lightens freckles, age spots, pregnancy marks, stretch marks, acne scars, pigmentation and discolorations, and it also reduces skin inflammation, puffiness and wrinkles. The licorice balances the skin's oil production, helps soothe acne-prone skin, reduces dark age spots and brightens the skin, as well. Ginseng increases the production of collagen, gets rid of eye puffiness and dark circles, and is a great skin toner. The horseradish lightens scars, blemishes, and treats acne and blackheads. Schisandra and the witch hazel reduce facial redness and both have wonderful anti inflammatory properties. The fennel seeds have amazing nourishing and healing properties because they are packed with minerals like iron, copper, selenium, potassium, magnesium, zinc and even vitamins like Vitamin C, Vitamin A and Vitamin E.3. The Hyaluronic acid is not an acidit will not strip or peel your skin like an acid does. In fact, its the exact opposite, the hyaluronic acid will moisturize and plump your skin making it look radiant and youthful.4.

"The First Year Soft Cloth Baby Books for Infants are fantastic!

"These are good-sounding earbuds.  They generally have a broad frequency response.  The bass is clear and assertive without being at all boomy; easy enough to distinguish many bass notes.  The high end is somewhat less transparent, but still good.  And the midrange is right where it should be - not dwarfed by boomy bass and blasting high end.Fit is totally subjective, but these do not fit my ears all that well.  I am a man with average-size ears, and most earbuds fit fine.  The barrel on these is a little long.  I find that they tend to loosen (which diminishes the sound) and eventually fall out.The cord is sturdy but a bit heavy.  This may be one of the reasons the buds do not stay in my ears.  Worse, when walking for exercise, the swaying cords transmit sound into the content I am listening to.I like the sound.  Not crazy about the fit.  A bit pricey.  They might well fit you better than they did me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L1CMU41K22IT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UT35XC#wasThisHelpful","R1L1CMU41K22IT","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The concept of functioning of this device seems terrific, and I would love to give it 5 stars for its purpose.  Unfortunately, at least for the one I received, some modifications were required to make it work well, correcting what I see as a manufacturing problem / quality control issue.I also wish the unit provided somewhat longer rods so that the device would accommodate longer cards (the PCBs I need to work on are 11.5"" long).  The vise is designed for PCB's up to 6"" x 9"", according to stellar technical dot com; this information does not appear on the Amazon page, nor even on the Weller site.  However, I found a hack that extends its maximum length.The problem with the unit, as I received it, is on the four clamp mechanisms for tightening down the sides firmly onto the 12mm rods: instead of having a slight gap that closes when you tighten the thumbscrews, the ends of the clamp jaws meet, and the hard plastic does not give way when you tighten.  This means that the 12mm rods cannot be made to fit snugly in the holes, and it is possible that the PCB could fall out of the vise if the sides slip out a bit.  Without any mods, it still works ok, thanks to the small rubber feet on the bottom of the sides, which cause it to mostly stay put at the width you want.I have three solutions to offer for dealing with the slipping rods:1. I used a saber saw to cut a gap into the jaw sides.  Remove the screws, then cut straight to the end from the hole.  If you want it a little wider, turn the cutting edge slightly towards the jaw side that does NOT have the rubber foot.  With this gap, it tightens firmly.2. You could go to the hardware store and buy a threaded rod 7/16"" in diameter and four matching nuts.  Put it in the center hole of the two sides and use nuts to hold it in place.  These rods are usually sold in lengths of a few feet, so you will probably have to cut it to a convenient length (around 13"").3. You could use two rubber bands placed around the feet part of the sides on each side to make the sides want to snap together.  Finding long enough rubber bands may be a challenge.  I did not try this, but I think it would work.To extend the maximum length capacity of the PCB, you can buy replacement 12mm rods (metal or plastic).  Amazon sells a suitable 12mm metal rod that I have ordered and will cut to about 16"" long.  Unfortunately, hardware stores in USA tend to offer 7/16"" or 1/2"" rods (wood or metal).  One is too narrow to clamp snugly, and the other is too wide to fit in the hole.  You could file or drill the hole a little larger, but then the original 12mm rods will not snug up.With the mods, the vise works nicely.  You can rotate the board either in 15 degree increments, or continuously with an easy mod for which there are instructions.  This makes it easy to insert a thru component on one side, then flip the card to solder.  The anti-static feature (untested) seems great too, but you may want to consider an antistat wrist band if dealing with sensitive components.With my mod to the clamp, the device rates 5 stars.  But as it is provided out of the box, the inability to tighten the clamps onto the 12mm rods detracts from the expected function.  The mods took some time - sawing, then filing - and with proper manufacturing and quality control, should not be necessary.  This is the reason I am giving this product 3 stars as it works out of the box.I found two Web sites that sell this product for under fifty-five dollars.  One of them is mentioned above.  I notice that many others sell it from $70 to beyond $120.  Now I suppose it is always possible that the more expensive prices is for a newer version that corrects the problems, but then the device is fairly expensive for what it is.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXHVAB7V9OHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005T5D9AO#wasThisHelpful","RXHVAB7V9OHE","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some reviews here have complained that the adapter supplied to reduce the 20mm hole to 5/8"" did not fit well.  I found it to be a snug fit (the way you would want it to be, to stay put), and it went on without any filing.  With the blade on the original cardboard container, I placed the adapter ring over the hole, then tapped it into place using a small hammer.  With the adapter in place, it fits perfectly on the 5/8"" shaft of my Delta Contractor Saw, and there is no wobbling.I bought this blade for one purpose: to cut thin sheets of aluminum (less than 1/8"" thick) into precise rectangles.  With a good fence (I have an Incra TS-LS3) and a properly aligned saw, it was very easy to get cuts to within 1/1000 of an inch, straight, and clean.  The blade cuts cleanly and effortlessly, without applying any force that could destabilize the operation.  A light touch-up with a very fine file is good for removing the few tiny burrs to achieve perfection.My table saw can support 10"" blades, and you may wonder why I got a blade with such a small diameter, when this aluminum-cutting blade is available in larger diameters.  My reasoning is that smaller blades have significantly reduced speed of contact with the aluminum, by comparing the circumference of a 10"" blade to this one.  Cutting metal is best done with a slower saw.  Since I cannot change the speed of the motor, a smaller blade has the same effect as reducing the speed to about 54%.  It has to be raised to near the top of its range, but I do not expect to need to cut aluminum thicker than this blade can manage.  If you have any comments about why this might not be a good idea, please let me know, but it seems right to me.It is important to wear ear and eye protection when using this blade, although for what I am doing it is no louder than cutting wood with a wood blade.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TK2POIUJWE9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XREDX2#wasThisHelpful","R2TK2POIUJWE9Q","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this to bolt to the underside of my shop-built router table, which is the outfeed table for my table saw.  I can confirm that the size of this box is large enough to be compatible with my INCRA PRL-V2 Router Lift, which has a plate size of 9 x 11, and some adjustment screws near the edges.  The inside top of the dust collector box is just a bit larger than the plate size, so there is no problem with adjustment screws, and no need for the optional adapter.  It is likely that if your router plate is this size or smaller that this dust box will be compatible, depending on how your router plate is installed and adjusted.  Mine is a simple dadoe to create a lip into which the router plate just fits.I had done a LOT of routing of slots, and it produced inches of sawdust on my floor, not to mention a lot going into my lungs.  I had more to do, so I decided to buy this box.  I had been putting off building one of my own - a very reasonable alternative - but I was anxious to get the big project done, so I bought a quick solution.  In terms of collecting dust, it does everything I need: depending on the operation, very little dust goes anywhere but into the dust collector.The dust box installs easily if you can remove your router table top and flip it upside down.  Even easier if your router top is thicker than 3/4"" (mine uses two sheets of 3/4 MDF glued together, laminated with countertop laminate).  It did not take long.  The most difficult and time-consuming part was disassembling my table then reinstalling it, not attaching the DC box.My main disappointment with this unit is the placement of the 4"" dust port: straight down.  It's fine if you have one permanently set up with a clamp, but in my small shop, I have to move the hose around.  The ideal would have been a panel at a 45 degree angle, pointing towards the floor on the back side.Second, a very common way of using a router involves dust collection at the fence, typically with a 2.5"" hose.  If this DC box had a 2.5"" port on the back, with a cap to seal it when not in use, it would be very easy to run a hose from the DC box to the fence port.Last, a gate to allow a variable amount of air to ""leak"" in to avoid putting too big a strain on the dust collector would be appropriate.  I see that feature on other DC boxes.Aside from these wishlist items, it's a good unit, just not worth ""I love it"" five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15PH6WIR949N9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHOBB3W#wasThisHelpful","R15PH6WIR949N9","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had one of these for a couple of years and have been very happy with it.  At some point I dropped it and cracked the display, but it still works fine.  Keeping it in the provided box when not in use probably would have prevented that problem.I recently bought a less expensive one from General Tool and Instrument (on sale about $15) from a woodworking store, and now I appreciate the Wixey all the more.  Two reasons I like the Wixey more:1. Most digital calipers with fractional capability use a 3-mode display: one for inches in decimal format, one for mm in decimal, and one for fractions.  The Wixey is the only one I have seen that has a two-mode display, by combining the decimal and fractional inch display on the same screen.  This is very handy.  The fractional part only appears when it is close to a 1/64"" increment - with perhaps .004 (1/250) wiggle room.  I often want to know what the nearest 1/64 or 1/32 measurement is, and having it pop up when it is close allows me to move it up or down a little to find it.2. The Wixey is all metal.  The General Tool and Instruments caliper I bought has an all-plastic body.I also have an analog (vernier) caliper.  While it does not give measurements to 1/1000, it does do 1/64, and being able to see the position between 64th ticks is quite helpful for some applications.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QFDS71VM67BM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PTGBR6#wasThisHelpful","R2QFDS71VM67BM","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some of the top reviews for this tool report that it takes off 3/32 or 1/16"" and makes a mess of the door edge.  These reviews are dated from 2008-9, and I wonder if perhaps the Dremel folks took the message to heart and improved this tool, maybe by simply shipping it with a smaller-diameter bit.  I bought mine around early 2013.In a room I have just repainted, one door was sticky at the top.  I got up on a stool and looked closely, and found that for the outermost (vertical) board of the door, it had just a bit of a hump compared to the horizontal piece it was attached to.  I figured sanding would take forever, so it was an opportunity to try out a Dremel accessory that I had not used.Following instructions for a change, it went on fairly easily and seemed secure.  I needed an extension cord, of course.  But with that and the stool, I started trimming.  I did not measure, but it took off very little material with each pass.  Judging by the quality of the debris, I would not be surprised if it was less than 1/32"" per pass, and maybe even the claimed 1/64"".  Holding the tool according to the instructions, and moving the tool steadily, I got a fairly flat surface with one pass, no gouging or ridges, as would be the case if it was cutting more deeply.  It was easy to control, again something I would expect from a shallow cut more than a deep one.  I needed to take a few passes to make the door open and close easily, so I repeated, trying it from the opposite side to keep it as even as possible.The tool made short work of a task that would have been difficult to do with any other tool I have - and I have a reasonably well-equipped shop for a weekend warrior.  Certainly, $20, or the extra cost of getting a kit that includes it, seemed worth the cost.The only complaint I might have, and it is minor, is that the perpendicular piece that is supposed to hold it square with the work is a bit short to do that.  If it was an inch or two longer, I could perhaps hold that in place with one hand, while using the other hand to hold the plastic piece on top against the work surface.  Alternatively, they could supply a removable piece to extend it, or at least drill a couple of holes to allow you to fashion your own out of a scrap of wood or metal.I would not call it a precision tool, nor at this price point would I expect it to be.  I bought the Dremel as a quick way to trim, sand, clean, or polish, especially for small items, and it suits those purposes well.Four stars means ""I Like It"".  I reserve five stars for products that exceed my expectations.  This one fully met my expectations, and I would recommend it for purposes similar to mine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25AHTK3VN0193/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002QZ1PQ#wasThisHelpful","R25AHTK3VN0193","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are planning a trip to Myanmar, you are probably wondering which travel guide to use.  This review is a comparison of the Insight Guides Myanmar (Burma), IGMB, April 2013, to Lonely Planet Myanmar (Burma), LPMB, Dec 2011.  Each has its strengths and weaknesses; they are designed for different purposes, and that needs to be taken into account when you choose.  For more information on Lonely Planet Myanmar (Burma) 2011, see my review for that book.OVERALL COMPARISONOverall, LPMB has more text details, and IGMB has lots of color pictures.  If and when LP publishes a Discover Myanmar (Burma) guide, it will be more comparable to IGMB.  For my purposes, both guides are useful and somewhat complementary in purpose.IGMB has between 25% to 100% of most pages dedicated to mostly pictures and some maps.  This has two obvious implications:1. IGMB has less text than LPMB.  LPMB does have a few pictures and more maps, but most of the pages are filled with paragraph text, text boxes, and tables.2. IGMB has a lot more pictures, in color on glossy paper, compared to LPMB.  It has maps of the larger regions, which means fewer details for use in town.Arguably, LPMB, with its greater quantity of text, and listings, would seem to be the better choice for a book to bring with you, especially if your trip is longer, or if you are going to make your plans as you go along.  IGMB has more descriptive information on the sights and history than LPMB.But all those pictures in IGMB may be very useful for travelers planning a trip, especially in deciding which country to visit, or which areas within the country to visit.  For visually-minded folks, sometimes pictures are a faster way to get a feel for where you want to visit than lots of text.  And for shorter trips, especially those with fixed itineraries, the textual information may be adequate.When I visited Myanmar in early December 2011, I had access only to the previous edition of LPMB.  I would like to have had IGMB to help me decide where to visit within Myanmar.  Having said that, I don't regret where I went, and I'm not sure that I would have chosen differently if I had seen IGMB.DETAILED COMPARISONIGMB, published April 2013, has 344 pages, is 9.2 x 6"", is fairly heavy, thanks to the coated glossy paper.  The pictures look better on glossy paper than LP's unglossy paper.LPMB, published December 2011, has 408 pages.  It is 7 3/4"" x 5"", and is fairly light, thanks to thin, unglossy paper.  LP's thin paper allows them to publish a guide that is lighter and more compact to carry with more pages, and it works fine for text.For comparison sake, let's take a case study.  Suppose you want to stay in Nyaung U to visit the Bagan area.IGMB has about 4 pages of text (total, in various parts of the book) that lists 4 places to stay.  2 restaurants are listed, and others on the road into town are listed.  Attractions focus on temples.  There are pictures in the Nyaung U section, but the only map is of the overall Bagan area, and the Nyaung U part is not very detailed.  Hotels, restaurants, and travel are listed in a separate section from the sights; this is due to the way Insight Guides are organized.LPMB has 5 pages of text that list 12 places to stay and 7 restaurants.  In town attractions include a gallery and a golf club; shopping lists a local market.  A table summarizes the various ways to get from Yangon to Nyuang U and relative costs, including: flying, train, bus, boat, car, and somewhat detailed text on each of these is included.  There is a small map of part of Nyaung U, but the only pictures are in the rather brief photos section.  In the Bagan temple section, there is another page about temples in Nyaung U, so a total of 6.But an effect of LP listings for hotels and restaurants is that these places get full of LP travelers quickly.  They become less available.  It's strange to be in an exotic location and have the place I'm eating be full of people carrying LP.  And they get more westernized by the needs of the new travelers, which can have pluses and minuses.  There are a LOT of places in Nyaung U alone, and many more in the surrounding area.  No guide can list them all.  One approach to getting one is to book with an agent while in Yangyon.  There's no guarantee of quality, though in my experience agents do reasonably well, and LP-listed places is also no guarantee of quality.ORGANIZATIONIGMB has a two-page table of contents at the beginning of the book, and a four-page index at the end.  Both are reasonably complete and well organized, covering the right topics.LPMB has had a facelift for its recent editions, and the organization is worse IMO than editions of 2010 and before; new LP guides are harder to use than the classic ones.  They have eliminated a table of contents at the beginning of the book in favor of very short tables of contents for some sections.  There is a seven page index, and you're really going to need it to find what you're looking for, since there is no table of contents.BOTTOM LINEAs a single travel guide, IGMB will be enough for those booking a tour that includes transportation within Myanmar, and perhaps for shorter visits.  With its pictures, it is a great resource for deciding where to go.  LPMB is better for DIY travelers who need all the details, for longer trips, or for trips where the plan is made on the fly.Using both - IGMB to decide where to go while at home, LPMB to bring with you - would be ideal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HAQ84POQY4G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780055633#wasThisHelpful","R3HAQ84POQY4G9","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very small book.  Measuring about 4.5x6 inches, with 142 pages, it really doesn't have room to thoroughly discuss the ideas it presents.  The ideas and illustrations are decent, as far as they go, but if you have a table saw and want to use it well, you need a book with better explanations.As an example, the section on table saw alignment is much too short.  While every table saw owner can and should learn to align their saw, this won't really help.  Your manual is a good start, but a book on table saws ought to tell you a lot more.  This format just doesn't allow it.The same is true for every subject discussed here; too little information.There are countless resources that offer much more details, more jigs, more techniques - books, DVDs, woodworking magazines.

"I bought the now-discontinued Miter 2000 gauge several years ago.  It serves similar purposes, but has two distinct disadvantages:1) The angle range is 0-45, instead of -60-0-+60 (the most important reason for switching)2) To use it in the other miter gauge, you have to do a multi-step procedure that takes a few minutesI decided to ""upgrade"" to this unit to overcome these limitations.  But there are still two caveats:1) To use it in the other miter gauge, you have to loosen two screws, slide the fence, retighten.  It takes less time, but requires that change2) The miter bar is a good deal shorter than the one on the Miter 2000, which means the width of the material to be cut is less.I can tell you that this unit DOES support most (but not all) Incra fences, including the one I got with the Miter 2000, and that's a huge win.Both models have the famous Incra accuracy, and are ruggedly built (the 2000 is more rugged, the MiterV120 is rugged enough).  Both make it VERY easy to get any specific angle you want at 1-degree intervals (and a special stop for 22 1/2 degrees).  When used with the fence, the MiterV120 is an excellent upgrade from your basic miter gauge that came with your saw.  Although the MiterV120 allows you to choose many specific angles, I use it the most set for 90 degree cuts relative to the blade.  Once it is calibrated, I can be sure of always getting exactly square cuts.Kreg has a competing model (KMS7101) which you should look at, but it has far fewer positive stops.  On the plus side, moving the fence (such as for changing which miter slot to use) is easier thanks to knobs to loosen and tighten the fence fastening (Incra's requires a tool), and the miter bar is a full 24"" long, much longer than for the MiterV120, allowing for cutting wider stock.I use the MiterV120 very frequently, basically for any cross-cut that is not so large as to require a cross-cut sled.UPDATE 1/9/2015: I noticed that somehow the seemingly beefy steel teeth used for setting the angle got damaged somehow at the most important 0 mark.  The result is that it is tricky to get it into the 0 and stay there; it slipped easily into about 1/2 degree.  I noticed this when some cuts were not quite the right angle. I improved it by repairing the teeth with a file, but a replacement would be better.Changed to 3 stars (""It's OK"") because it should be built to last forever.  But note: I am a fan of Incra tools and own several; I'm just disappointed with this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2835VD7UM21VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RCTTG6#wasThisHelpful","R2835VD7UM21VP","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a lot of table saw books out there.  This is not the best of them, though it's not bad for the areas that it covers.  The main problem I have with it is that it includes some exotic operations (such as cutting coves into thick wood or pattern cutting) while not covering some essentials.Is it a beginner's book?  Yes, but it's incomplete at that.  Is it an advanced techniques book?  Yes, it includes exotic and advanced techniques that you may never use, and is by no means the last word on advanced table saw use, either.  They should really have chosen one direction or the other, or better yet, do two different books to cover both directions well.There isn't a lot here that I have not seen in other books, or the many shop magazines.  It fails to cover essential topics.  It isn't as well organized as it could be (safety covered in two separate sections, safety combined with dust control, TWO articles on kickback instead of one).Here is the organization of the book:1. Tablesaws and blades - a survey of commercially-available saws and blades2. Techniques - ripping, crosscutting, joint-quality edges, safe procedures, tearout, coves, and pattern cutting3. Joinery - box joings, dovetails, tenons4. Dust control and Safety - containing dust in a contractor saw, shop-made table saw guards, causes and prevention of kickback, and kickback again5. Cross-cutting jigs6. Shop-made accessoriesThe sections consist of articles by many different authors - many of them well-known.  This brings in the expertise of many but limits the cohesiveness of the book.If I was the editor, I would have ditched the exotic techniques in favor of including a detailed procedure for aligning a table saw.  Sooner or later, you're going to need to learn to do that; it isn't trivial; it has several steps; it requires special measuring guides; it becomes necessary eventually just from using your saw.  And it is essential both for getting good cuts as well as for safety reasons.  In general, there are advanced topics included here at the expense of essential topics.I laughed when I saw the part about cutting a 4x8 sheet of plywood.  One guy feeding it in the front.  Only at the end does he suggest a partner for helping with the outfeed.  To my way of thinking, cutting a sheet of plywood on a table saw is only suitable for very large, professional table saws like the 7 HP monster at our specialty plywood store, at least if it is 1/2"" or 3/4"" thick (or more).  A much better approach is to ask for the it to be cut into two pieces at the store (with a bit of excess for you to trim to exact measurements on your own saw), or to use a hand circular saw with a guide.The one part I really liked was their approach for dust-proofing a contractor saw.  I tried to do that, but my approach meant that the blade could not be tilted with the back cover in place, so I have to take it off every time I want to tilt.  I plan to try again using the ideas presented here.BOTTOM LINE: Three Stars - ""It's OK"".  Somewhat useful, but insufficient to be your only table saw reference, whether you are beginner or intermediate.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L73ABCJHHJR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561587494#wasThisHelpful","R2L73ABCJHHJR0","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book presents several useful ideas for a workshop in a form that will allow a beginning woodworker to build them - complete cut lists, step-by-step instructions with photos, and things to watch out for.It's good as far as it goes, but for my purposes as an intermediate woodworker who wants to build a workbench, it is a bit too elementary.  Only one approach is discussed for any of the constructions; there is no discussion of alternatives.  For tool drawers, he uses an over-sized bottom designed to fit into slots.  The problem is, when you load those drawers with tools, they will be hard to open, which is why most other designs use heavy-duty drawer sliders.The contents:IntroductionTools and MaterialsSawhorsesWorkbenchTablesaw WorkstationRouter TableStorageAll of these projects have been presented before, and with better designs.  Consider Fine Woodworking's Best Workbenches, which chooses a narrower range of items to build, but gives you more options for designing them, albeit without the cut-lists and step-by-step instructions that could be very useful to some beginners.  If I built any of these, I would be bummed when I later found a vastly superior design which made me want to build it again.  That's the drawback of showing only one approach for each topic, instead of giving you a broad range of options.  His elementary instructions on attaching a vise are fine as far as they go, but Best Workbenches covers the subject in four pages in a manner that will give much better results.My approach for designing a new workbench was to go to the library and find all the books that discuss workbenches, and look them all over for ideas.  Then I went into the DVDs with back issues of Wood Magazine, Woodsmith, and ShopNotes to find more ideas.  I noted approaches that seemed useful for my needs, then eventually refined these down to a list of notes about exactly how I would build my workbench.  But if you design your own, you'll have to come up with your own cut lists and figure out what steps there are to assembly.One important thing I learned, which I didn't think about because I mainly work with plywood, is that in fastening a workbench top to the base, you do NOT want to put screws in the corners if you are using solid wood or butcherblock.  As he points out, this is just asking for the top to crack as it shrinks and grows with seasonal weather changes (especially humidity).  The problem is, he wasn't very specific about exactly where to put the screws to fasten the top to the base in a manner that avoids cracking the top yet keeps the top firmly on the base; all he says is to put four screws through the top end stretchers into the benchtop.So yes, if I was a beginning woodworker, this book might be useful, although when I was a beginner I did not have the range of tools he has, or the skills to use them in the manner he instructs.  But as an intermediate woodworker, instead of jumping to the first design, we need to consider several different design methods in order to find the one that suits our individual style best, because workshops are definitely not one size fits all.BOTTOM LINE:  For me, it's three stars - ""It's OK"".  For a beginner, it could be four or five stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15T0OUGZ3OQ58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AK3RN1G#wasThisHelpful","R15T0OUGZ3OQ58","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A workbench is the heart of any shop, whether for woodworking or other handy or hobby work.  It is a very personal thing; there is no one universal type that makes sense for all kinds of people.I think for beginners, the best thing is to make a simple one quickly and inexpensively.  But eventually, you may get to the point where it's time to build the bench of your dreams - YOUR dreams, not somebody else's.  That time came for me, and I decided to get as many books as possible and study the designs, along with designs in woodworking magazines.This book shows the classical designs of the past few centuries, and it has several variations on these themes.  Thinking outside of the box, it shows work centers that don't look like conventional workbenches.This is not a beginner's project-oriented book.  You won't find complete plans with cut lists and assembly instructions.  There is enough detail to build anything in it, but without specific dimensions etc, you are necessarily building a custom design for each idea.I took out several books on workbenches from the library, and researched back issues of Woodsmith, ShopNotes, and Wood Magazine.  Of the many resources I studied for ideas and solutions, this one is the most comprehensive for someone designing their own like me, and I like it better than the books written by the most famous names - some of whom also contributed articles to this book.The book is organized in five parts:1. Choosing a workbench - general styles of custom-build and ready-made workbenches2. Workbenches that work - a study of eight workbenches with anatomical details sufficient to build them3. Holding workpieces - vises, hold-downs, clamps, and other devices for holding the work to the bench while you work it4. Improving a workbench - tips for flattening the top, accessories that can be added to an existing bench5. Specialized Workbenches - work centers for other purposes than the general-purpose benchThe most valuable part of this book for me was very detailed instructions for mounting a front vise to the bench.  Sure, I've done it before without instructions, but there are great ideas here that I did not come up with, but will definitely use for my new bench.I was thinking about a drawer cabinet for tool storage below the bench top.  For reasons of the steel frame I am starting from, I decided I would have to build two separate boxes rather than one big one.  In this book I found a project for a drawer cabinet that also took this approach, for different reasons.  While I will still design my own, there are useful ideas to be found in reading an article from an expert who has already done it.I like the benchtop bench - a good solution for having adjustable benchtop height, in that the auxiliary bench can bring the work higher for some kinds of work.  But a really useful tip that I had not seen elsewhere is the use of two veneer-press screws for the vise.  I have decided to use this approach for my MAIN bench, for the end vise; it is much less expensive than buying a nice wide end vise, and since I'm unsure I will use it a lot, it's a good way of having an end vise available for occasional use.  There is another variation that uses pipe clamp heads that would also work, except that the vise faces cannot move is far, resulting in more dog holes.Aside from these two articles, I got lots of ideas and guidance for designing my workbench from the book as a whole.  The book is full of photographs and drawings, although it does NOT include dimensions of the sort you find in detailed woodworking plans - and I don't need those anyway.Having studied the book (and several others like it), I have picked up ideas for features that I will use, and am confident that the bench I am building will last for years.BOTTOM LINE: Five Stars ""I Love It"" - because it is the best (for my purposes) of MANY books I have looked at.  YMMV.  If you are a beginner, this may be too advanced, though there is a design a beginner-intermediate could build if they are able to produce their own cut lists etc.  If you are looking specifically at a traditional bench, there are other books that examine those in more detail.  This is in between - a very practical guide to today's workbench ideas for someone inclined to design their own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E6U21F78RE5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600853897#wasThisHelpful","R1E6U21F78RE5J","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this triangle to help with laying out cut lines for woodworking.  I bought the smallest and largest sizes to accommodate varying sizes of wood, and I find them very handy for their purpose.  I got ""smoke"" rather than clear, which is easier to find in a busy shop, but you can still see through it.  The small one is a bit darker in color than the large one.I don't have a precision tool to measure accuracy of the 45 degree angles, but the accuracy looks quite good.  The right angle is as close as I can feel when placed against a precision aluminum alignment tool.This drawing triangle is very useful for drafting and for use in layout in the shop.I might have prefered that it was a bright color instead of grey, simply so that it can be spotted more quickly.BOTTOM LINE: Four stars means ""I Like It"".  I reserve five stars that exceed expectations in some way.  This tool does its job well and I have no complaints about it, but there are many others similar in quality and price, and this one is as good, but not better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B65HKF27QHPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027AASD0#wasThisHelpful","R3B65HKF27QHPX","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main value of a screen protector is keeping the screen clean and free of finger smears.  No screen protector will protect the glass from being broken if dropped or crushed, and glass is unlikely to scratch, short of using a diamond or sharp metal on it.KINDS OF SCREEN PROTECTORSThe most common kind of screen protector is glossy, though slightly less glossy than the screen. From the perspective of optical quality, the best is naked (no screen protector), then the glossy kind, then this one (an ""HD"" anti-glare type), and last a conventional anti-glare type.THIS HD ANTI-GLARE PROTECTORI expect to use my Surface Pro for drawing, and having it lie flat is the easiest way to draw, but that also means it is subject to glare and reflections from any ceiling lights. This screen protector is anti-glare, accomplished by etching tiny lines into the plastic.  It calls itself ""HD"" (for high definition), and the fine pitch of the lines is what makes it stand out from other anti-glare screens.  HD keeps the image sharper than conventional anti-glare screen protectors.  I bought a conventional anti-glare screen protector for my Nexus 7 tablet, and even though the screen is lower resolution on a pixels-per-inch basis, the image is a bit less sharp from the lower resolution of screen scribes.I am very nearsighted, so when I look at the Surface Pro with this HD screen protector in place closely without glasses,, I can see tiny specks of color which are caused by diffracting the emitted light.  However, people with normal vision or using glasses probably won't notice these.DRAWING AND WRITINGA screen protector also adds a little friction that you can feel when using your finger on the screen, or when writing or drawing on the screen with the stylus.  The naked glass surface has very little drag.  A conventional screen protector is smoother than an anti-glare type, so it has more drag than naked glass but less than an anti-glare protector.  I consider this drag DESIRABLE, because it gives you more control, and the anti-glare drag is similar to pen/pencil on paper.  I anticipated that the anti-glare surface would be a bit less slippery, and it does indeed add a bit of useful drag for drawing and writing.COST - IS IT WORTH IT?This screen protector is more expensive than other anti-glare protectors, and there is only one provided, not two.  But the HD scribes are worth it, and I think the plastic is somewhat thicker.  There is a black border that matches the frame of the Surface Pro perfectly, and there are holes cut to allow the camera and other front panel sensors to work properly.  Most screen protectors come with a little plastic card that is used for working the bubbles out to the edge where they disappear.  THIS screen protector does not include one of those, but perhaps because it was thicker, it was easy to put it on with NO bubbles.INSTALLATION TIPS1) clean the screen thoroughly with a glass cleaner and a soft, lint-free cloth.  Allow to dry.2) when applying the screen protector, start with a narrow edge, and put the edge of the plastic right at the scribe of the glass screen3) don't press it down at first.  Gradually lay it down, checking that the edges align correctly, and in particular that the camera and other centers are at the center of the holes.  If they are not, pull it back off and start again until you get it right.  When you have the holes aligned correctly, you can smooth the remaining protector down - carefully, to avoid bubbles.BOTTOM LINEFour stars: ""I Like It"".  It is more expensive than conventional anti-glare screen protectors, but there is a difference is in image quality, and you are far less likely to get bubbles. I'm glad I spent the extra money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B6Y62IZTRYZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AF0ELG#wasThisHelpful","R1B6Y62IZTRYZZ","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:economical spare/replacement power supply that works with Surface Pro (and probably RT)supports 100-240vac for worldwide use (with plug adapter)CONS:no USB charging port like MS power supplyno LED on power adapter to indicate that it is working when connected, like the MS power supply3-wire plug instead of 2-wire like MS power supply (NOTE: some units may have 2-wire, as shown in Amazon photo)First, this is NOT a MS branded power supply; it is an inexpensive knock-off with nearly identical specs.  The Surface Pro requires 12 volts at 3.6 Amperes, and this unit claims to support that.The MS branded power supply also has 5 volts at 1 Ampere for a USB charge port on the power supply,  This unit does not have a USB charge port.  Assuming you don't need the USB charge port, this isn't a problem.  You CAN charge on the Surface Pro anyway, though at somewhat lower current (USB3 says 0.75 Amp max to be in spec), and with only one USB port on the Surface Pro, you may need it for other purposes.The proprietary connector on the cable is the same as the one found on the original power supply; it fits well, maybe slightly more snug and therefore less likely to fall out, but also requires just a small push to make connection.  It should have an LED to show it is plugged in like the MS unit has, but there is no LED on this unit.Like the original power adapter, this one runs on 100 to 240 volts AC, so it should work anywhere in the world with a plug adapter or alternate cord.  I wish it was designed for a two-wire plug; I'm not sure what the advantage of a ground wire is for a properly insulated power supply.  NOTE: the Amazon photo shows the unit with a two-wire AC cord; mine is three-wire.It is a good spare power supply, and inexpensive enough to have one in the various places you use your Surface Pro.  I like the MS one more for traveling, so this one is used a lot as the primary power supply at my home desk.  I will update this review if I have any problems in the future.Be aware that there are probably different units with different specs and possibly different reliability, because most likely it is being produced by more than one Chinese manufacturer, yet they may all be sold as the same unit on Amazon.  Thus, your experience may vary from the reviews you find here - some say reliable, at least one says melted down.  If you buy one, test it by using it a lot during the Amazon return window.I will update this review if anything happens to change my opinion, but I think this is a good buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B0HGRBHOFISK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C6WSXTA#wasThisHelpful","R3B0HGRBHOFISK","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROSAdequate protection for dropping your Surface deviceFits well with clear access to all ports, vents, speakers, mike, camerasElastic loop for stylusStand has choice of three viewing anglesElastic hand loop for holding firmly with one handCONSThe hand loop holder is mainly useful for portrait orientation, not landscapeNEUTRALNo storage accessories other than stylusThis is the early days for Surface Pro accessories, and we don't have many choices.  After reviewing what was on Amazon, I decided on this one.I wanted a case that allowed the device to be protected while in use.  Zipper bags that require you to remove the device are no good to me, because there is no protection if it is dropped.  Part of this case stays on the device at all times (though it can easily be removed thanks to a velcro fastener).  The other part snaps on and off, and must be removed to use the hand loop, but stays in place when the case is used to stand up the device for viewing.Another important thing to me is variable viewing angles when the case is used as a stand.  The built-in viewing support for the Surface Pro has only one angle, and it is the wrong angle for viewing when the device is on a desk (too steep / close to vertical to fully see the screen).  This case has three useful viewing angles, which is far more flexible.As for protection, this case is not padded with foamy stuff, but the surrounding material is thick enough to protect it.  The worst damage comes when a device is dropped onto a corner or edge, and this case has ridges in these places that prevent the device from coming into contact with a hard surface.  I think this is adequate protection.  Bigger, thicker, rubber cases are made for other devices that probably offer more protection, but at the time of writing they were not available for Surface Pro on Amazon.There IS an elastic loop for storing the stylus; it's located on the long edge opposite the spine.  I did not notice it at first, and my original review complained that there was no loop, so I have updated the review.There is no storage for any other accessories - power supply, earbuds, cables, disks, etc -  but chances are you're going to put the device in its case into some kind of briefcase or backpack that will have space for the accessories.  I would not want an increase of size or weight to accommodate these accessories.There are magnets built into the cover that cause it to stay closed when you fold it shut, but the magnets are not strong, and it opens easily.  The magnets have no other effect than holding it closed - for example, on a Google/Asus Nexus 7, covers with magnets can cause the Nexus 7 to turn off the screen when the case is closed, and nothing like that happens here, probably because MS did not put a magnetic sensor in the Surface Pro.  That's fine with me, because the Nexus 7 gets its screen turned off even when a magnetic over is folded backwards.The cover allows the use in four ways:1. Take the device out and use it ""naked""2. Unsnap the folding cover and hold it with the case's hand loop3. Fold the cover all the way back and use the device flat4. Use the case to prop up the device at one of three fixed anglesI got the indigo color, expecting it to be the color of dark blue jeans.  In fact, it is darker than that, like a dark navy blue.  I wasn't crazy about the color selection; I prefer bright colors that stand out when I am looking in a black bag, or looking around the room to make sure I haven't forgotten anything.Other reviewers complained about the workmanship and stitching.  The workmanship and stitching on the one I received were very good overall.  While it's not real leather, I think it's better with durable imitation leather, because real leather can get wet, stained, or otherwise damaged.Overall, this case appears well made and likely to last.  I think it's the best currently available that meet my requirements.BOTTOM LINE: Four stars - ""I Like It"".  It meets my basic requirements, but there is room for improvement, especially for storing the stylus.  Nothing unique in its features to make it a five star unit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VNTSAZHRI6AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B0O1CJ8#wasThisHelpful","R3VNTSAZHRI6AF","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether you use traditional or electric tools, woodworkers live and die by clever ideas for all kinds of work.  While titled ""Setting Up Your Workshop"", this book also includes many great ideas for jigs to solve various problems.  Of course, you can pick up a lot of these ideas by working with other woodworkers, or reading the magazines.  The tips here are different from the books published by magazines, which tend to be rehashes of things previously published in magazines (but can still be useful).The book assumes that the reader needs only ideas, and not complete project-oriented discussion, parts lists, dimensions, etc, so it is not a totally beginner-oriented book.  It does not teach the techniques used for building the jigs, which could be helpful for a beginner, but the ideas are simple and most woodworkers will have no trouble figuring out how to build (and modify!) the jigs.  They do offer suggestions while you are building to help you get the details right.Here is the chapter listing:Introduction - 3 short essays from experienced woodworkers about what they do and what that means for their shop1. Shop Layout - 17 pages planning the placement of major tools, benches, etc for various shop sizes, and locations like garage, attic, basement.  Lighting, power, heating, ventilation, floor2. Workbench - 14 pages covering essential construction of a traditional bench, plus 10 pages on a variety of accessories (dogs, hooks, carving holders, sawing accessories, shooting boards)3. Shop Accessories - 17 pages on dust collection, air-powered tools, and mentions of useful secondary tools like shop vac, grinders, compressors, etc4. Storage - 20 pages on storing tools, wood, clamps; a fold-down workbench and tool cabinet5. Work Surfaces - 37 pages on work tables, sawhorse and variations, clamping jigs, feed stands, shop-built extensions for routers (e.g. tables), band saw (circle cutting, extension table), drill press table, outfeed for table saw6. Safety - 16 pages on jigs to make work safer, things to wear to protect yourself, first aid, instead of admonishments to use your saw blade guard and be carefulIndex - longer and more detailed that most, but there are lots of ideas in this book to indexMost readers will find familiar ideas explained well, but also new ideas.

The full track list:1. Opening Theme2. Going Under3. Through Being Cool4. Jerkin' Back 'N' Forth5. Soft Things6. Pity You7. Girl U Want8. Planet Earth9. Whip It10. Race of Doom11. Super Thing12. Uncontrollable Urge13. Mongoloid14. Jocko Homo15. Smart Patrol / Mr. DNA16. Gut Feeling17. Gates of Steel18. Beautiful World#19. Workin' In a Coal Mine#The last two tracks on the CD version are not on the LP release; they are from a show earlier in Nov 1981 that I saw in Boston's Orpheum Theatre.  Also, the CD has broken out the ""Set Change Countdown"" that opens ""Super Thing"" as a separate track, though both are on the LP.From Jerry Casale: ""This was cut from a cassette recording of DEVO's show in Seattle, WA show in Nov. '81. DEVO archivist Michael Pilmer (aka Devo-Obsesso), found the tape in a shoebox full of cassettes in Bob2's home fifteen years ago, which he immediately transferred it to DAT. Afterward it promptly disappeared in the flotsam of Devo history. Here resurrected it stands as a testament to Prince's claim ""Devo, you guys are crazy!""""When he says it is a cassette recording, I suspect that it came from the sound board, not just an audience recording.  The sound recording is good for a cassette recording that was digitized; I'd like to hear the drums a bit more on the high end.The performance is also very good, and they get even more lively as the show progresses. Most of the new songs are quite similar to the album arrangements in most cases, yet it does not sound at all like they just flipped a switch and sang along.  For songs on previous albums, they have evolved a bit from their studio versions.  The guitar work, in particular, is a bit varied compared to the studio versions, notably in ""Girl U Want"", and the vocals are a bit different.  ""Race of Doom"" is a bit crazier, especially on the drums.  Some songs sound a tad faster than the studio versions.  The audience sounds are a bit higher in the mix than I would prefer, but mostly they do not intrude.BOTTOMS LINE: Four stars - ""I Like It"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZF32V0WFKO2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C5JHBB0#wasThisHelpful","R2ZF32V0WFKO2Q","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one is a book of 13 projects for a wide variety of home-built work platforms, including a few actual workbenches.The projects are:1. Carver's vise - buy a metal screw and make a vise out of wood2. Collapsable workbench - designed to be separable into four parts to minimize storage and make moving it easy3. Fold-down workbench - a stationary workbench designed to close up into a minimal space when not in use4. Grinding bench - a small bench for a power grinder with wheels5. Crafts bench - for sewing and other light crafts6. Low bench tool tote - combines sawhorse, stool, and tool carrying7. Metalworking bench - a small bench made with metal parts and wooden top8. Miter saw bench - optimized for using a power miter saw9. Sawhorses - foldable for compact storage10. Assembly bench - for sanding and assembly, with drawers and a cabinet11. Shaving horse - you can sit on it while stripping bark from branches12. Traditional English saw horse - fixed, not foldable, sturdy13. Traditional workbench - a workbench he designed inspired by traditional woodworking benchesThe target audience would be a beginner-intermediate woodworker, who has the skills and tools to accurately cut wood in a variety of shapes and sizes, but wants to have very specific designs for specific purposes.  If any of these are exactly what you want, and the size you want, the very complete instructions, parts lists, and photos would make it easy to build them.The problem I have with this book is that it does not achieve the goals of the title (""Build your own CUSTOM Workbench"") or the back cover (""Build a workbench that meets your woodworking needs!"").  Woodworkers each have their own idea for what they need, but on the other hand, there are a handful of classic designs that show up in some form over and over again - including #13 in this book.Most of us end up building a bench that supports the tasks we need to do and in the size we need, but if your goal is to get ideas for building a CUSTOM bench, other books do that much better.  A key requirement is the height of the work surface, which will vary depending on the person who will use it, but there is NO discussion in this book on that design element.Of the 13 projects, there are only 3 designs for what I would call a woodworker's workbench designed to handle a variety of construction tasks.  I don't have the kind of space to have a lot of purpose-built benches around, so I need one that can be used for a wide variety of tasks, and I have studied several books on DESIGNING workbenches.  To have a CUSTOM bench, it will be necessary to create a design, or modify an existing design, but it won't be a cookbook project-based approach like in this book.The Traditional Workbench (#13) was what I was looking for, but his design is not elegant, and not as functional as this kind of bench can be.  It features a front vise (but no cover for inner jaw) and a single-screw end vise, but no discussion of other kinds of vises (tail vise, leg vise, wagon vise, two-screw end vise), and not enough detail on mounting a vise.  What he refers to as a ""tail vise"" is called an ""end vise"" in most books and magazines I have researched.  There is no discussion of types of bench tops, or the alternative of buying a pre-fab top.  Where I think it is useful to have a top that is a bit longer and wider than the base for clamping purposes, this design has the top about the same size - a mistake I made when I built my current bench.  Overall, the biggest problem is that he gives only one example of a workbench, and omits any discussion of design alternatives that are appropriate if you are building a CUSTOM workbench.The assembly bench project has lots of problems.  It is a big boxey thing with no wheels or even anything to grab ahold of if you want to move it.  No ""toe kick"" space on the bottom as is standard for counter cabinets so you can stand up close to your work.  I think it is much too tall for an assembly bench: it appears to be about waist high, whereas assembling larger objects is easier if you have a low table.  There is a lot of cabinet and drawer space below the work surface, but it is far more than I would need for the tools used for sanding and assembly.The best woodworking books use projects to introduce techniques skills with a variety of uses; this one does not teach much new about woodworking.  The one tip I saw was for cutting large panels.The index is minimal; most of it is just the table of contents listed in a different order in a half a page.  There IS an entry for his tip on cutting large panels.BOTTOM LINEI am an intermediate-level woodworker, and I got nothing useful or new out of this book.  There are other books that explore variations on woodworking benches and accessories that are just more inspired.  On the other hand, for someone who needs exactly one of these things and has not developed design skills, this book could be handy, but the title does not correctly describe the content of the book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J8I51H6MZVCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=155870678X#wasThisHelpful","R3J8I51H6MZVCI","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I heard ""te quiero a ti"" on jango's channel.  Modern sounding, with modern instruments, but there's an interesting twist: the beat is very slightly different.  It's difficult to convey in words, but if you consider the cumbia beat to be LONG-SHORT-SHORT-LONG with accents on the two LONGs, then what's different is that the second LONG comes in a little later than standard cumbia, giving a kind of ""lope"" to the rhythm.Perhaps this sounds subtle, but the Cumbia rhythm is mostly very standard, and of all the cumbia I have listened to (LOTS), this one stands out because it has changed the beat.  You might even say this is not quite cumbia.Now for the music in the album.  I really like the song, ""te quiero a ti"".  The problem is, there is not very much variety in this album.  The same loping cumbia beat is used on every song, and the overall sound is very similar from song to song.  That's the reason I have given the album three stars - not enough variety - but check out the samples to hear how this album changes cumbia, just a bit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX8HG8OPW71BD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039E22A0#wasThisHelpful","RX8HG8OPW71BD","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Normally I would give a four-star review to a cable that simply does the expected job.

"PROS:Wide range of fine adjustmentsRecharger / wall adapter works 100-240VAC, suitable for foreign travelWorks fine for a tough beardCONS:Does some jobs better than othersCombs are wider than the trimming head, so detail work is a bit harderIf you want to get rid of a beard or mustache altogether, or if you just want to get one under control, this device will do fine.  As a bonus, it also has an ear and nose trimmer that works reasonably well.  It claims to be a hair clipper, but it is no substitute for clippers designed solely for a haircut.I tested mine by letting my rather tough and thick beard grow out for a couple of weeks, then experimented on it.  This review presents what I learned from trying it out.BEARD AND MUSTACHE TRIMMINGThere are two combs you could use for this, but unless you want beard hairs longer than 1/2"", you'll probably use the smaller one.  The larger one covers the same range, except it goes up to 3/4"", and it is a little larger in diameter; I'll probably never use it.  Both combs slide on fairly easy once you figure out exactly how it is meant to go on by looking closely at the slots around the length gauge as put it together.  The gauge gives a reasonably effective measure, except it has numbers starting at 1, and it isn't clear how long the 1 setting is supposed to be, the minimum is said to be 3/64"".  My last use was on 4, and it was shorter than I would prefer, but hey, it'll grow back.The instructions advise you to comb through the hair to be trimmed against the grain, and that's good advice.  I would further advise you to start at a setting you know will be too long, then try again a couple of notches down, and so on until you know what you want.  Eventually you'll know what you need and just set it and use it, but at first you'll want to experiment to find out what works best.I wanted my neck clean-shaven, and it had been more than a week since I shaved it.  I used the trimmer without a comb to cut it down to size and had no problems with it snagging or cutting skin, but be careful if you do this, because there is not much guard left for the moving blade.My beard is tough, and yet this trimmer had no trouble getting through it.  There is also a ""Turbo"" button that makes the motor run faster (and presumably run the battery down faster); I found I did not need to use it.MINI-SHAVERThe trimmer head turns a quarter turn to be removed, and the other cutters go on the same in reverse. I tried the mini-shaver to define lines around my beard, and between my nose and my mustache, for cleaning up.  It worked fine for this, but did not result in as clean a shave as my three-head Norelco shaver, not even close.  I also tried it on my neck, where my beard is toughest, and it worked poorly for shaving that clean.Don't assume that this device will replace a good shaver, if you have much of a beard that you want to shave cleanly.EAR AND NOSE TRIMMERThe device worked well for trimming hair in these places.  The instructions advise you not to insert it in your nose more than about a quarter of an inch.  This is especially important for the ear canal, because the device is rather loud when used there.  The trimmer also works well for trimming those odd hairs that show up on the edge of ears of middle-aged men; you can move it around your ears without worry of snagging skin, and it will catch most of them.There are small, battery-operated ear and nose trimmers that are much quieter (due to a rotary motor) and work a little better.BODY HAIR?The instructions say this device is for face and neck.  Naturally, it can be used for any hair anywhere, but it is not ideal as a personal trimmer.  The tips of the combs can catch on your skin, as they are a bit sharp.  A file might help take the edge off.  Also, don't use too short a setting, as the metal teeth that move back and forth are not adequately protected from snagging actual skin.  With common sense, it does work, but they probably did not call it a personal trimmer for legal reasons.USAGE NOTESTravelers will appreciate having a charger / adapter that works on 220V; not all trimmers support dual voltage (actually, all voltages from 100-240VAC).The click-stops for the trimmer combs allow the adjustment to stay put, because they fit snugly, unlike trimmers I have used in the past.The Turbo button makes the motor run perhaps 50% faster.  I didn't need that, but maybe it helps in some situations, such as using the mini-shaver.I'm not sure what ""100% water RESISTANT"" even means, because water resistant means that it is not 100% waterproof.  In any case, it looks safe to disassemble it and rinse it off in running warm water, but I would not immerse the entire unit or use it in the shower.BOTTOM LINEFour stars means ""I Like It.""  It has all the features I need as a beard and mustache trimmer.  It will be helpful for cleaning up after using a conventional hair clipper for haircuts.  The nose and ear attachment works well enough.  There is nothing to complain about here, but it also does not excel: it simply does most jobs it was designed for reasonably well.  It won't replace having a shaver and AC-powered hair clippers for those jobs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL1D7VZ72WQH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARF428O#wasThisHelpful","RL1D7VZ72WQH7","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A comedy about a Seder Supper?  Seems unlikely to be all that funny, but this one surprised me.  Not just for Jewish people, but anyone who has a clue about what a Seder Supper is may enjoy it.  Some of the humor refers to Jewish culture, but some is clever family funny stuff.Essentially, we have a family of wildly different ""types"" trying to have the traditional family ceremony/supper for Passover, and a lot of unexpected stuff comes up or goes down.  As the guests arrive, we see that the family is so full of extreme types as to be unrealistic, but that is part of what makes it funny.

"These songs are bad remakes, not the original artists. They sound nothing like the original.  The album lists the names of the original artists, and it isn't them performing.1. Listen to ""I'm a Man"", supposedly by Spencer Davis Group: the singer is clearly NOT Steve Winwood (who sang the original version), and the backup band sounds like an 80s New Wave group with synth instead of organ.2. ""Winchester Cathedral"" is a different singer; he's not even using a megaphone as in the original.3.

"How do you write a book about all that NYC has to offer?  It's a daunting task, and the authors here chose to pare it down to size by describing most (not all) of Manhattan, only, which represents 7.6% of the area of the city proper (calculated from numbers on Wikipedia) for all but 8 pages of the book.  Granted, the back cover says ""Experience the best of New York City"", and for many people, that means Manhattan.  And ok, it does actually have 4 pages each on Queens and Brooklyn.  For me, having been to Manhattan a few times, I am more interested in exploring other boroughs, and off-the-beaten path places that won't be found in a book like this.This book is called ""Discover New York City,"" and the ""Discover"" series should be seen as a new breed of LP books, very different in purpose and design from traditional LP guides.  This isn't a bad thing.  Sometimes it helps to have lots of nice color photos to help decide where you want to go, and this book would be especially helpful for early research.  However, it is not going to have the depth of information found in the traditional LP guides.It also does not replace the original guide series, which is still published and updated, and you may indeed want to bring the New York City Guide with you for more details.  As a comparison point, the Lonely Planet New York City Guide has 448 pages, far fewer photos, and less white space, compared to this ""Discover"" guide with 312 pages and lots of photos.  What this means is that the City Guide has more information in text form, but the Discover guide shows you what things look like.  Fortunately, you have a choice of either or both.New Yorkers could argue for days about what should be listed but is not, but I would argue that what is listed I this book is a lot of the best known attractions that bring tourists to the city.The book includes a pull-out map.BOTTOM LINE: 4 stars, ""I like it.""  For someone who has never been there and wants to pick out highlights to optimize their time, the presentation of NYC in this book will speed up that task compared to a traditional travel guide, but it is not intended as a replacement for the latter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QY6GDFSQ2S7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742205860#wasThisHelpful","R1QY6GDFSQ2S7T","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I moved to the Boston area 33 years ago, and have spent a lot of weekends and vacation time exploring New England on most forms of transportation, including driving.  I have to agree with the choices of places to visit outlined in this book,but I also have to quibble with some of what they say.WHAT THE BOOK IS, WHO IT'S FORWhile published by Lonely Planet, this is considerably different from LP guides.  There is a nearly exclusive focus on places to visit that are accessible by car.  However, you may still wish to consult with conventional LP guides for information on lodging, eating, transportation, and the many excellent places worth visiting that are NOT in this book.I would recommend the book both for people coming to New England as tourists, as well as New Englanders who are so used to being here that you have forgotten what a nice place it is to be for weekends and vacation.  Even a business person who is driving around the area could benefit by knowing where really pleasant drives are for days when you have time to go a little out of your way to enjoy them.WHAT'S COVEREDNew England consists of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.  Each of these states have some of the best parts of New England to visit, making it hard to choose.  Fortunately, distances are not as great as they are in larger states.The book identifies 8 of the 32 driving tours as ""Classic"", which are defined as those top iconic sites, top activities, and unique New England experiences.  I can't argue with their choices among the 32 tours described in the book, but there are ""Classic"" tours, especially in metro Boston, that are not discussed (see ""What's NOT Covered"").NOTE: the photo of the cover shows what might have been a pre-edit version of the cover, incorrectly stating there are ""37 Amazing Road Trips"".  The copy I received says 32, so perhaps five were cut.The overview section also identifies top places to visit by various interests you may have: seafood, outdoor activities, beer and wine, art and architecture, history, and wildlife.New England is unique in having wonderful beach and seashore options, mountain drives, and all manner of culture within a relatively small area of USA.  There is a tangible New England feel that you can experience here, owing largely to the comparatively long history and age of the cities and towns you'll find here (of course, the age does not compare to many places on other continents).  And this book does manage to capture most of the top reasons to visit.While the book does cover some lodging and dining options, but not to the extent that a ""real"" travel guide would.  You don't necessarily need to get a full travel guide for more options, as there are many online resources to help you find places and read reviews (TripAdvisor, Yelp) or even book reservations.  Don't forget to consult Wikipedia for in-depth coverage on your candidate visits.WHAT'S NOT COVEREDThe back cover advises you to ""Discover the freedom of the open road"".  Well, it isn't always all that open.  Because New England is a popular place to visit and live, and because of the age of the roads (especially within cities and towns), there is traffic to be dealt with.  During high season, you will certainly not feel all alone in your exploration.In particular, Metro Boston is essentially skipped - it gets a two-page mention with few highlights called out, though there is a very nice plug for the LP Boston City Guide which, to be fair, is probably worth having for a serious visit.  The reason for downplaying Boston is obvious: it is best explored on foot, via mass transit, or in taxis, and NOT driving a car.  Without a GPS, it is nearly impossible for a visitor to navigate.  Within some areas, especially downtown Boston and other city centers, it can be difficult or very expensive to park.When it comes to some of the interest groups the book identifies - in particular, seafood, beer and wine, art and architecture, and history, Boston has the very best.  For history, you can't beat a day walking the Freedom Trail, which includes Paul Revere's House (it's genuine) and the USS Constitution.  For seafood, there's nothing like Legal Seafoods (on the high end) or the classic No Name Restaurant on Boston's Fish Pier (on the budget end).  For beer, in Boston you can visit a Sam Adams Brewery.  For art,  Boston has Museum of Fine Art, the Gardiner Museum, and even the Museum of Bad Art.  For architecture, Copley Square and Harvard Square are only two of the major places to see.Cambridge's Harvard Yard does get a brief mention in the ""Ivy League"" tour (which, oddly, is grouped with New Hampshire), though half of their words are spent describing the relatively unimportant statue of John Harvard, which they refer to cynically as the ""focal point"" and as the ""statue of three lies,"" one of which they say is that the statue is not of him.  While that is true, Wikipedia says that the reason is that because he had a brief life that ended in 1638, the 1884 sculptor did not know what Harvard looked like, and had to improvise using another model.  Wikipedia does a better job explaining the truth around this legend.Page 18 has a nice picture of Harvard's distinctive Memorial Hall.  Unfortunately, they don't tell you the name of the building in case you'd like to visit it, and it's also not in Harvard Yard, which is where the tour advises you to go; rather, it is just north of it, across the street.Being a big city, Metro Boston also caters to many other interests you won't find by driving around New England - live music, nightlife of all kinds (including LGBT), ethnic cuisines, and any number of special interests and hobbies.There are many non-car activities listed I this book, but not covering Boston can be forgiven because it really is not a place you want to drive around.  Still, if you have never seen New England's most famous city, it would be worth budgeting part of your visit, for example before you pick up a rented car, or a few days before you leave.WHAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHTFall foliage is seen in countless photos of New England countryside.  However, there is no specific advice on how to experience it, and it is not even listed in the index (except in reference to a parade), although there is a Fall Foliage tour as one of the 32 covered in the book.The problem is that the peak foliage is brief, and some years it is great, other years you could come and wonder what all the fuss is about.  Although some trees start to turn in August even in Boston, ""real"" foliage season would be mid to late September in the north, until first week or so of November in the south.  There is lots of advice that may help if you search for ""how to predict fall foliage in New England"" (without quotes).The book says that high season runs from May through August.  To my way of thinking, it runs from mid-June or July 1 to Labor Day, and again in the region-specific foliage season.General weather predictions for New England are always suspect, but the book is not accurate in my opinion.  It says July and August are hot and humid.  In fact, in an average year, there will be a total of 14 days where you might really wish you had an air conditioner at night, but these ""dog days"" can also happen in June, and certainly we do not get them for all of July and August.  Most of the time temperatures will be less than 90F and temporary humidity around rainy spells.  They don't mention that we get a fair amount of rain - not every day, and not always all day - in May, early June, and September, but that rain can and does happen unpredictably year-round.They also don't mention the rare but not impossible snow in late April or early May, or even before Halloween.  In describing winter driving as ""perilous"", that applies only during and immediately after the occasional winter storms, which vary a lot in frequency and intensity from year to year.  Winter can be a wonderful time to visit natural areas, especially seashores.  Late February and March can be sunny and beautiful (though sometimes chilly) between periods of snow and rain.Page 225 (in the New Hampshire section!) states that Cambridge's Harvard Square exudes energy, creativity, and nonconformity.  They tell you to go for the bookstores and used record stores.  Unfortunately, this describes Harvard Square as it once was, but those days are over, thanks to new owners of the real estate and higher rent.  They used to say that Cambridge had as many book stores as Somerville had pizza parlous, and that was once true, but sadly, most book stores have closed in the wake of online book shops.  There still are some used record stores, mainly around, not in, Harvard Square.  The spirit of energy, creativity, and nonconformity is now found (to a lesser extent than the glory days of Harvard Square) in Davis Square, two stops north on the Red Line in Somerville.Finally, Lonely Planet is famous for its sometimes unrealistic advice on environmentalism.  This book, encouraging you to explore by car, flies in the face of the usual LP dogma as they advise you to ""rev up your engine"" (which is neither useful nor good for the environment).WHAT'S JUST GOOD ENOUGHThe maps are good enough to give you a rough idea of where to go, but there is no substitute for a good map site (like google maps) and a GPS, which is essential for driving in New England.  The rhetoric is written like marketing in a tour brochure, just a bit too much snake oil and not enough fact, but it suffices for the level of information found here.Tip: if you have a day with extra time, use a GPS and try selecting your destination and using an option for ""shortest distance"" rather than ""shortest time"".  I did this traveling from the heart of the Adirondacks (NY) to my home in Metro Boston, and it took me on the most amazing tour of southern Vermont.  Also, have a look at roadsideamerica dot com for some offbeat but interesting attractions along the way (I have no affiliation except as a user).The many places worth visiting really are the highlights of New England, but I have to admit that I am very pleased that they omit many of my very favorite places, which are not far from what they describe but require a bit more research or exploration to find.BOTTOM LINE: Four stars, ""I Like It.""  It is a useful book.  The many quibbles I have quoted herein are natural for a region that has more opinions than people living or visiting it, and do not detract in a major way from the value of the book.  The content fits the title reasonably well, even if the car is not always your best friend, especially in Boston.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OSIVOKQ1U6H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1741798116#wasThisHelpful","R1OSIVOKQ1U6H1","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this album, which represents a reunion of the ""real"" Gong.  They put a lot of effort into the songwriting and recording, and the results hark back nicely to You and other classics, while having an updated sound.  Clearly Daevid Allen has ideas in his head that could not be realized with the technology of those days, or even maybe today's, but this album comes closer.  There is a wider range of styles of music than the Radio Gnome albums.At 75 minutes, this is what we used to call a ""double album"" (because it would take two vinyl discs to contain that much music).  Ironically, with that much music, they could have trimmed a bit and made a stronger album overall, but I guess I'm glad they gave it all to us.Aside from Allen, it's great to hear many of the original members.  It was obvious that some of the guitar work was from Steve Hillage, whose skill has advanced considerably from when I last heard his guitar work, though he was great back in the earlier albums.  He has worked as producer, too, and is probably responsible for the polished sound.Shakti Yoni (Gilli Smyth) is back and featured on a couple of interesting experimental tracks.  I laughed when she punned on modern technology with the line about looking on your hard drive and finding a PHP (an obvious reference to the ""Radio Gnome Trilogy"" from the 80s).  She sounds older, which one would expect, but I was shocked to read on Wikipedia that she is 79 years old! And still doing psychedelic and witching vocals!  You go, girl!Four stars means ""I Like It"".  Some tracks are very good, others just ok, but overall, it's a great update that recalls the earlier style yet gives it a new sound.  Maybe 4.5 stars.  I may revise my rating after a few more listens.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SMC5XSSV7REQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LWJ50G#wasThisHelpful","R3SMC5XSSV7REQ","A33775AIB1A664","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33775AIB1A664?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have replaced one that was lost, another that went through the washer and was never the same after.This new HJ-323U pedometer from Omron is different in some useful ways, but does not offer much in the way of new capabilities. There are two aspects of the better Omron pedometers: the hardware component - which you carry when you are walking - and the software product, which stores and analyzes the results.HARDWAREThe HJ-720IT was oval in shape, and a bit thicker. The new HJ-323U pedometer is rectangular, sort of like a large thumb drive or pack of gum. A cap comes off of one end to reveal a standard USB A plug connector that fits most laptops. There are three other buttons and a display.The device works in a standalone fashion to record the number of steps you take in one day. This count is always accurate. It also has some internal calculations that approximate the distance you walked, and the calories you burned. These two are based on two setttings: the length of the stride in your walk, and your body weight.The calculations are only approximations. People do not walk in consistent strides, so the total distance won't be exact. It will be most exact for exercise walking where you seek to set a certain pace and stride. The other calculation, number of calories burned, is probably based on walking on flat land; the device has no way of knowing that you might be climbing a hill, for example, which could substantially boost the number of calories you are burning.The device is intended to measure steps, only. If you ride a bike with the device in your pocket, you will get some measure that does not mean much in terms of steps, distance, or calories.It does make a distinction between ""aerobic walking"" and all steps taken in a walk. ""Aerobic"" means that you went non-stop for at least 10 minutes, at least 60 steps per minute. That may not be enough to make it really aerobic, but it's not too far off.Essentially, from a hardware-only perspective, this is not very different from the earlier HJ-720IT. Having a built-in USB plug, instead of requiring a USB A to USB B mini cable, is convenient.It would have been nice if the device included a rechargeable battery that would recharge when plugged into a USB, but it still uses the same button-style battery.SOFTWAREThe HJ-720IT includes software for Windows at least, not sure about Mac. The HJ-323U takes a different approach: it uses Web-based software to take your statistics from the device and manages and analyzes them on the Web. The Windows software of the predecessor was clunky at best, occasionally getting itself into a state where it could not load from the device without resetting the file, losing all your history.Personally, I don't see any value at all to having Web-resident software, and I do see some disadvantages. In particular, you obviously have to be on the Web, and the Web software needs to be up and running. At any point in the future, Omron could decide that they are done supporting this device.

"I like the presentation. It opens with an government run nuclear reactor accident and the backstories that led up to the event are revealed to the reader. Most interesting and riveting to me was the very common story of a young marriage falling apart when the couple is taken out of the environment where they fell in love and are thrown a burden of adult responsibilities: jobs, children, money -  and how even a solid relationship will splinter when people continue to mature in their 20's.A well done debut.The basis for the novel is fascinating: January 3, 1961 a Power Plant in Idaho was destroyed after a control rod was removed incorrectly. Killed were Army Specialists, John Byrnes, age 25 and Richard McKinley, age 22, and Navy Electricians Mate Richard Legg, age 25.

"I greW up in northern New Jersey and never heard of Lily Dale, NY. The author grew up near Lily Dale, N.Y. and she captured it vividly. Incorporated in 1879 as Cassadaga Lake Free Association, ""a camp and meeting place for Spiritualists and Freethinkers"". The name was changed to Lily Dale Assembly in 1906. The village is founded to ""further the science, philosophy, & religion of Spiritualism"". dvd No One Dies in Lily Dale No One Dies in Lily Dale  Lily Dale: The Town That Talks to the Dead (Plus)Bella Jordan and her son Max intend to deliver a kitty to one of the residents and move on. Unfortunately the resident is now dead, murdered. This sets of Bella's need to solve the murder before she and Max can move on. The wit and the author's way with bringing characters to life was oerfect for me.FYI - this title should not be mistaken for the Young Adult Lily Dale series written by the author in 2009:AWAKENING She may be able to see the future, but she needs to know what happened to her past. Calla thought that her boyfriend breaking up with her in a text message was the worst thing that could ever happen to her. But just two weeks later, her mother died in a freak accident, and life as she knew it was completely over. With her father heading to California for a new job, they decide that Calla should spend a few weeks with the grandmother she barely knows while he gets them set up on the west coast.To Callas shock, her mothers hometown of Lily Dale is almost entirely populated by spiritualists who can communicate with the deadand her grandmother is one of them. Suddenly, the fact that her mother never talked about her past takes on more mysterious overtones. The longer she stays in town, the stranger things become, as Calla starts to experience unusual and unsettling events that lead her to wonder whether she has inherited her grandmothers unique gift. Is it this gift that is making her suspect that her mothers death was more than an accident, or is it just an overactive imagination? Staying in Lily Dale is the only way to uncover the truth. But will Calla be able to deal with what she learns about her mother's past and her own future?BELIEVING: sequel to Awakening. After her tumultuous summer in Lily Dale, Calla has decided to stay, knowing there is still much more to learn about her mother's untimely death. As school begins at Lily Dale High, Calla finallys tarts to feel at home in her new town. Despite her excitement over the affections of Blue Slayton and her growing feelings for Jacy Bly, Calla can't ignore the urgency of her latest visions. Someone is desperately trying to contact her again-this time because the killer, whose victim she helped locate, has kidnapped another girl and may be after Calla next. Unless she learns to trust the warnings she's receiving from the spirit world, Calla could be in serious danger.CONNECTING:  Will a shocking secret change Calla's life forever? Although Lily Dale is a world apart from her old life in sunny Florida, Calla has finally accepted her ability to communicate with the Other Side. But the person Calla is most desperate to connect with is the one spirit whose energy she can't seem to feel anywhere: her mother. It seems like a lifetime has passed since her mother's death, and she's still no closer to finding out the truth. But as she and Jacy grow closer, his visions show Calla in serious danger. Together they must try to make sense of the signs they've been receiving from the Spirit world-and quickly. As long as her mother's killer is still on the loose, Calla will never be safe.Making her way back to Lily Dale with even more twists and turns, bestselling author Wendy Corsi Staub will have readers on edge in the third book of her thrilling paranormal series.DISCOVERING: Calla finally knows the ""who"" behind her mother's death but she still doesn't understand the ""why."" Could it involve the half sibling her mother kept secret for decades? Unwilling to share her recent discovery with anyone, including her father who just moved to town, Calla must call on the spirit world once again for help in finding her missing sibling and the final clues behind her mother's death. Will Calla's journey bring the closure she seeks?","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AQB7ER81ZYAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629532487#wasThisHelpful","R3AQB7ER81ZYAE","A1I6U5AQAT3ZG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I6U5AQAT3ZG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are itching for Jack Reacher to reach a whole new level of violence than this will be for you. The author has a knack for dialogue and is a huge best seller in his home of New Zealand . His publishers asked him to set his new novel in the US. He eagerly and successfully took on the challenge. I have been to New Mexico 3 times in the last 7 years, and he captured it vividly for my reading. This is a non-stop-excitement thriller that No Country For Old Men would be proud of.Marshall Grade  is ex-NYPD living in Santa Fe New Mexico in the Federal Witness Protection program after an epic failure. The safe house the government has him in he sublets to an ex-con (and right there I am thinking Felix's days are numbered). To fill the hours he uses his skills (theft, narcotics, intimidation) looking for MIA Alice Ray. Wayne Banister aka Dallas Man, is offered a contract to take out his employer, mob boss ""The Patriarch"". He also goes after Marshall Grade. Leon is a drug trafficker who no longer has the $3 million he should have and like any sociopath will perpetuate any horror to get it back. And the list goes on.To paraphrase my favorite TV crime show of 20+ years: In the criminal system, there are  wo separate yet equally violent groups: the justice department who take on the criminals and the criminals who produce stomach turning horror. These are their stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMHDMV0KQNYOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250058791#wasThisHelpful","RMHDMV0KQNYOJ","A1I6U5AQAT3ZG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I6U5AQAT3ZG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Why did I order this title? the opening sentence of the blurb sucked me in and I had to know the answer ""When Walter Stahl was five-years-old, his mother drove away in the family's blue Volvo and never came back"". Also, I had not read a graphic novel since 3rd grade and the cover captured me (even if the guy on the cover looks like something from the 1970 manual 'The Joy of Sex').Walter's Vietnamese mother with a Liberace obsession takes off one day, Walter and his father uproot the,selves and settle in Las Vegas hoping to one day locate her there. At the same time we follow his mother on her journey, including flashbacks to her childhood, and learn what led to the family being fractured.A surpising amount of death and deception for such a quirky cover and premise.

"Epic, unflinchingly  and hard hitting, in the last chapters of the book the future as envisioned by the author seems all too reasonable because she captures the last 30 years so realistically. There is a  lot to like and love in this novel of a family beset with tragedy and hope but don't expect a beautiful golden story - it's been a couple decades of terrorism, war and financial ruin for this country and so it goes for this family.For those readers, like me, who did not read the two earlier titles yet, I found these summaries helpful:SOME LUCK (2014)  a powerful, engrossing new novel stretching from 1919 to 1951 the life and times of a remarkable family over three transformative decades in America. On their farm in Denby, Iowa, Rosanna and Walter Langdon abide by time-honored values that they pass on to their five wildly different children: from Frank, the handsome, willful first born, and Joe, whose love of animals and the land sustains him, to Claire, who earns a special place in her fathers heart.  Each chapter in Some Luck covers a single year, beginning in 1920, as American soldiers like Walter return home from World War I, and going up through the early 1950s, with the country on the cusp of enormous social and economic change. As the Langdons branch out from Iowa to both coasts of America, the personal and the historical merge seamlessly: one moment electricity is just beginning to power the farm, and the next a son is volunteering to fight the Nazis; later still, a girl youd seen growing up now has a little girl of her own, and you discover that your laughter and your admiration for all these lives are mixing with tears.  Some Luck delivers on everything we look for in a work of fiction. Taking us through cycles of births and deaths, passions and betrayals, among characters we come to know inside and out, it is a tour de force.EARLY WARNING (April 2015) opens in 1953 (and stretches to 1986) with the Langdon family at a crossroads. Their stalwart patriarch, Walter, who with his wife, Rosanna, sustained their farm for three decades, has suddenly died, leaving their five children, now adults, looking to the future. Only one will remain in Iowa to work the land, while the others scatter to Washington, D.C., California, and everywhere in between. As the country moves out of postWorld War II optimism through the darker landscape of the Cold War and the social and sexual revolutions of the 1960s and 70s, and then into the unprecedented wealth, for some, of the early 1980s, the Langdon children each follow a different path in a rapidly changing world. And they now have children of their own: twin boys who are best friends and vicious rivals; a girl whose rebellious spirit takes her to the notorious Peoples Temple in San Francisco; and a golden boy who drops out of college to fight in Vietnamleaving behind a secret legacy that will send shock waves through the Langdon family into the next generation. Capturing a transformative period through richly drawn characters we come to know and care deeply for,","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R2I5LNBUETJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307700348#wasThisHelpful","R2R2I5LNBUETJU","A1I6U5AQAT3ZG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I6U5AQAT3ZG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Women truly were 2nd class citizens until my generation were handed equal rights (for the most part) on a platter.

"The flagrantly gay Francis Bacon takes off for Post WW2 Tangier with his older, and rich, lover David. What follows is a hot mess of intrigue completely enjoyable to me for not knowing the first thing about the real Francis Bacon and what a hot mess he was to himself and those in his circle.THE FIRES OF LONDON (2012) A killer takes refuge in the blacked-out streets of wartime London, upending the world of one of Britains greatest painters in this chilling and captivating reimagining of the life of Francis Bacon.  Francis Bacon walks the streets of World War II London, employed as a warden for the ARP to keep watch for activities that might tip off the Axis powers. Before the war, Bacon had travelled to Berlin and Paris picking up snatches of culture from a succession of middle-aged men charmed by his young face. Known for his flamboyant personal life and expensive taste, Bacon has returned home to live with his former nannywhos also his biggest collectorin a cramped bohemian apartment.  But one night, death intrudes on his after-hours paradise. When a young man is found dead in the park, his head smashed in, Bacon and the rest of Londons demimonde realize that they have much more to fear than the faraway scream of war.THE PRISONER OF THE RIVIERA (2013): Peace has come to England and the blackout is over, but the gloom has yet to lift from London. One night, leaving a gambling club where he has run up a considerable tab, the young painter Francis Bacon, accompanied by his lover, sees a man gunned down in the street. They do what they can to stanch the flow of blood, but the Frenchman dies in the hospital. Soon afterward, Bacon receives a strange offer from the club owner: He will erase Bacons debts if the painter delivers a package to the dead mans widow, Madame Renard, on the Riviera. What gambler could resist a trip to Monte Carlo?  After handing over the parcel, Bacon learns that Madame Renard is deadand the striking young woman who accepted the delivery is an impostor. The Riviera may be lovely, but in 1945, its sun-drenched beaches can be just as dark as the back alleys of London.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R302GND9TNZEKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497641497#wasThisHelpful","R302GND9TNZEKB","A1I6U5AQAT3ZG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I6U5AQAT3ZG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The beginning was, to me, overly implausible with laborious plotting. I can see where the author tried to bring the characters to life, but it shouldn't so obvious to the reader, it's a good effort and needs stronger editing.

"He truly deserved what he got, sadly he took 267 men with him, including his younger brothers, Thomas and Boston Custer. From the 2010 Pulitzer Prize in Biography author (for the life of Cornelius Vanderbilt). Nothing revisionist or redeeming here just the fully fleshed out expose of the man,  the times that created him and doomed him. This is a keeper.Decades ago I was so disappointed to learn that Civil War hero Custer (1839-1876) was not the dashing officer portrayed by Errol Flying back in 1940. My fascination remained and this biography is wonderfully compulsively readable. First off, I had no idea he died so young (36 years old). I loved the first half of the book which covers his Civil War career and touches on the politics of the time (I would have enjoyed more information of his youth and family background from the 600 page book). He was in so many epic battles:First Battle of Bull RunBattle of AntietamBattle of ChancellorsvilleBattle of GettysburgBattle of the WildernessBattle of Yellow TavernBattle of Trevilian StationSiege of PetersburgAppomattox CampaignThe book resonated with me to such a degree I am looking forward to reading .Connell, Evan S.

"This picnic cooler was a LOT larger than I expected, which is a good thing.  It looks like a small cube on the product page, so to my surprise, it fits more items than I thought.  I plan to use this for byob and table setting for potlucks.  I also added a set of retractable hotdog and marshmallow sticks for campfires/grills.There is enough room inside to add one of those 7"" cheese boards with the tools (stored inside).

No need in unzipping the entire top to access your wine bottle or whatever you need to grab on that side.In my opinion, this is a very good investment, because you will use it sooner or later, and its versatile.  Not like those old fashion picnic baskets that most people seldom use these days.  At least this one can be used for many occasions, even if you don't need to use the entire place setting but just the wine glasses, and some cheese and crackers.

The best thing this will last for years so its an investment and you can use it at home too even though its small it fits easily on any table....and instead of using it with wine/crackers you can use it for breakfast to hold butter and a block of philadelphia cream cheese.

"I own two of these.  I purchased mine from ""emergency essentials"" because it was cheaper. I buy a lot on amazon, but when their prices are more its not worth it.  And it looks like now, you don't even get the handle included.  I know I never used either handle, as I use mine with one of those long handles you can unscrew from a mop head.  I've had mine for several years now and still use the original one weekly.  I initially purchased it for using while I was out boondock camping, and even though I'm at home now I still use it.  I use 3 buckets (usually)......add clothes to water and soap and let them soak about 30 minutes while I'm cleaning or watching TV.  and then start washing them and rinse them in the other bucket. I do all of this inside the bathtub while I'm standing on the outside.  I use a small bucket with a pouring spout right under the tub faucet to fill it up with water and transfer to the other buckets.

I'm not a movie type of person, unless its maybe a documentary, but all the hype that was broacast on TV about this movie and all the predictions, I had to watch it and actually I like it!

Anyway, to my amazement they are not that hot as long as you keep eating them.  Once you stop your mouth feels the burn, but you really can't tell while eating them at all.

"Please note that this is a ""bottle"" carrier and not a wine carrier (for regular size tall wine bottles).  They do not fit in an upright position, but one will fit if you let it lay to the right or left a little.  Even if you do insert a tall wine bottle it will zip, but you will struggle doing so.  This carrier is on the short side, so if you're purchasing it for smaller wine bottles, tall beer cans, or tall beer or cocktail bottles then this will do just fine.  I own a few types of these carriers and actually I like this one the best with the handle that swings, but its just too short so like I had mentioned I just don't carry 2 bottles and it will fit okay with a wine glass, some cheese/crackers etc to the side.  They do make these with two holes on the lid for the winde bottles to protrude out, but I just don't really like those depending on where you're taking this carrier, it will be obvious what is inside.  The corkscrew opener can be placed in the small exterior pocket too, to conceal it from view if needed.

"As of right now, I own 2 of these and also one of the ""lite"" version.  If you're not pressed for getting a smaller size, just buy THIS one (the regular Trail Seat).  And watch the price and buy it when the price is lower ($10-13) and even watch for used ones.  Regardless, these are must have for anybody that sits in regular cushioned chairs, wooden chairs, benches, on the ground and wherever else.I keep one in my vehicle in case I ever need it, and the smaller ""lite"" version in my backpack, but one of these stays inside my home laying on top of a cushioned dining room chair (where I use my computer).  The cushion on the chair is only so comfortable and after awhile my bottom starts to hurt, but using one of these on top of that cushion REALLY REALLY helps.  Wish I tried these a long long time ago.Also, I think the major key in using these is to blow them all the way up with air, close the nozzle, and sit on it, and THEN release the air while you're sitting on it until it gets to the most comfortable level.  And in my opinion, less air equals more comfort with these cushions.  If you're not into the newest and best colors, just buy the cheapest one when its on sale and be done with it.

"So far, I've purchased the 180 count boxes in Irish Creme and Italian Sweet Creme and the Italian Sweet Creme is the best in my opinion.  At least for everyday use.  I think the Irish Creme flavored one is best for special occasions every so often so you won't get tired of the flavor.  The Italian Creme version is like your everyday cream and sugar. 2 pouches will do the trick for most people and no added sugar necessary.  I drink my coffee black most times, but when I want a change or a treat I add these creamers.  I keep them in the fridge and take out about 15 at a time for my coffee station and of course I keep some in my vehicle and some cooler bags for when I stop by somebody's home.None of my boxes had any damage inside or out and the expiration dates are about 9 months from now.

"These are great, however, I only rate them at 4 starts do to the hydrogenated oils.  I've tried these room temperature, refrigerated and frozen.  Frozen is the way to go!  Just pop them in the freezer overnight and the next day take one out and wait about 3-5 minutes and start eating :)  They take longer to eat that way and the flavor is a lot better too.  They taste more like ""sherbet"" when frozen and at least that way you won't go through the full 4 pack so easily.

"I own the regular keen whisper, but these leather versions run about 1/2 size smaller so make sure you order up!  I was hesitant in ordering a half size up as I only wear a 9 1/2 in hiking boots and figured no way are these sandals going to run small, but I guess I was wrong and everybody else in the other reviews were right.  So, I ordered up and they fit just marvelous.  I have no issues with my heel hanging out or anything else.  They fit just right.  I actually went on an hour walk within 2 hours of receiving these shoes.  When I first put them on they were a little stiff, but after my walk they felt like a glove.  As far as the weight, in my opinion they are almost the same as the fabric version.  I really couldn't tell a major difference.  I held one of each in each hand and could barely tell any difference at all.  I can tell you what I noticed right off the bat, and that's the fact these look less like a tennis or running shoe like the other whispers do.  So, these are great to wear when you want to sort of look a little more dressier without the reflective pull tabs and the keen logos.  The keen logo is very subdued, and not noticeable at all.  Please note that the laces in this version do not stretch like the regular whisper sandals, but you can pull them snuggly to fit.  I find these more appropriate for traveling when you don't want logos, reflective and bright orange markers illuminating from your footwear and providing you a choice of attire to wear without feeling you need to wear sportswear to match your footwear.  Nice casual pants would go with these (black or the brown versions).  I purchased the brown when the price dropped to about $39.99 and once the black ones drop, I'll be purchasing those too.  These don't feel any different than the fabric ones in my opinion, however the footbed seems to be a little wider, maybe a tad bit, but the feel is very comfortable.  Give them a short workout or do some bending back and forth to break them in initially......doesn't take much.  Just order at least 1/2 size up and they will fit just fine!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDJWM5QWIRRCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LG80ICU#wasThisHelpful","RDJWM5QWIRRCN","A2J591OLWPBEMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J591OLWPBEMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already own the regular picnic time folding chair and purchased my first one back in 2006.  They are like tanks and last forever (almost), depending on how much you abuse them.  I can say the frame will last forever, as I never had any part of the frame bend, loosen or become distorted in anyway.This new ""Fusion"" chair is the KING of the outdoor folding chairs period.  This one has a spot for everything you want to keep outdoors at a hands reach.  No need for any additional side tables....nothing at all.I purchased a small umbrella to attach to my chair and skipped the LARGE beach umbrella thats too cumbersome to carry along with the chair.  The umbrella I purchased is at the link below and when I'm not using it, it easily stores in inside the attached ""criss-crossed"" bungee cords.  It slides right through the bungee cords and tightly secured, so when you're carrying the backpack on your back the umbrella can come along and you don't even know its there.  Also, when you're not using it, you can store it there and it doesen't get in the way at all.  And the best thing the colors match!  This is a must have accessory for this chair.http://www.amazon.com/Sport-Brella-Versa-Brella-Position-Universal-Firebrick/dp/B00HA2ZKFQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1444161321&sr=8-1&keywords=sports+brella+versaI keep a kindle on the top storage shelf under the table and store my purse inside the cooler.  I know its for ice/drinks but so far I haven't had the need to use the cooler yet or the other pockets, except the one for drinks. I know one thing, there is more than enough places in and on this chair to stash just about anything you would need while at an event, outside your home, or camping.  I can't think of anything its missing.  It has it all.  I do like the cell phone pocket a lot.  It fits my smartphone, but not sure if it will fit a ""samsung note"" or phaplet type phone.I do like the rear zippered storage area in the backrest, where you can place the carrying strap and other items.  The hang tag indicates that this chair was manufactured in 2014, so its fairly new.  I'm extremely satisfied with this chair and can't wait to get some more use out of it next month on an upcoming camping trip :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RO2T70MU3KKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078K6X60#wasThisHelpful","R1RO2T70MU3KKT","A2J591OLWPBEMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J591OLWPBEMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far, 5 stars.  I own the large sportsbrella too, and the only thing I would suggest is not to use these or any other umbrella in winds exceeding 10-12 mph and you shouldn't have any issues, unless you have the inside of the umbrella directly facing into the wind then it will ultimately revert.  But, for a normal breezy day this umbreall and the large sportsbrella works fine as long as you have all the joints locked into place to prevent any unnecessary movement.But, this umbrella is awesome and the right size for camping chairs!  I purchased the red one and was suprise that its NOT bright red as I thought it might be.  Its a burnt red color that doesn't stand out like neon colors.I'm using mine for the chair below.  Looks really good and attaches to the side of the backrest very tightly and secured.http://www.amazon.com/Picnic-Time-Fusion-Folding-Chair/dp/B0078K6X60/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1444160574&sr=8-1&keywords=picnic+time+fusion+red+chairIf you don't use these on a very windy day they should last you a long time.  More or less, use these like you would use a ""patio umbrella"" when the wind picks up just collapse them.  5 stars from me though.

"If you own a Columbia Bahama fishing shirt, then these pants are the identical color and material and match perfectly.  The pants seem to run a little small around the thighs.  I'm 5'4"" and purchased the regular length.  Wearing hiking boots these the length of these pants fit just right without dragging the ground or anything.  However with sandals they do hit the ground.  I only plan to wear these with boots that have thick soles like hiking shoes, so no issues with the length.  I love the nylon fabric for helping the wicking effect.  The fabric also reduces SPF, repels water and stains and very lightweight for packing.  As some other reviewers mentioned, the included belt is very handy since its sort of built in (but can be removed if wanted).  The cargo pockets on each leg is VERY nice to have for a variety of reasons and they cand hold a lot.  I've since ordered a 2nd pair for backup, considering the price was only $14.00. These pants are perfect for hiking if you order them larger, but that kind of goes for any hiking pant which you really need a good range of motion and comfort and not so much for appearance. The zipper is YKK which is a good thing. Oh, and the color ""Fossil"" is tan and not beige as some of the images reflect.  I rated these pants with 4 stars due to the fact the fit around the thighs are a bit off, but I still like them and will definitely wear them for sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23KNBSCMQEKMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2FLY8E#wasThisHelpful","R23KNBSCMQEKMO","A2J591OLWPBEMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J591OLWPBEMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read all the reviews before purchasing including reviews on other websites.  Just about all buyers believe this jacket runs small, so I ordered X-Large and it fits!  I wear size large in most shirts/jackets, but this one you definitely have to order a size up unless you're in-between sizes. This jacket will trim you down and make your girlish shape even more shapely, which is a major plus to me.  This jacket will dress up a pair a jeans and t-shirt and make you look more polished.I purchased the olive green color because it blends in with landscaping most places and doesn't stand out.  I really really like this color.  You don't have to worry about the sleeves fitting either, because they cinch at the wrist with velcro.  The hood cinches too and when the jacket is completely zipped up, hood and sleeves cinched you will be seriously covered and protected.The zipper has an upper and lower zip which for instance, if you're all button up and hooded up you can unzip from the bottom to access pockets or even go to the potty at a moments notice without removing your jacket.I do like the hidden interior pocket.  Its big enough to hold a man's size wallet not the checkbook size.  Anything in there should not get wet at all.  This pocket will work very well while traveling also to stash some extra cash, or a place to keep cash to avoid accessing your purse throughout the day.I'm glad I accidently ran across this rain jacket, as I had planned to purchase a different one initially.  The only CON I see in this jacket is the ""columbia"" name and logo embossed on the left sleeve.

"Order these panties by referring to the size chart ""waist sizes"".  My waist size was equivalent to the size 9 which is also listed as 2XL and they fit.  I wear clothing in size 12-14 and the size 9 or 2 XL fit perfect and wasn't tight but snug.I actually didn't have a good first impression of these panties.  No waistband and the weird looking rubber strips around the inner legs left me dumbfounded, but once I tried them on and had them on all day and walked for a full one-hour, I was sold.  It was hot and muggy out and my undies weren't sweaty and they didn't rise up and wicked pretty good.  I do like how thin and silky they feel.  Since they don't have a waist band they are super small to roll up and pack away for traveling or backpacking.  They are the lightest undergarments I've ever purchased.  I ordered 2 different sets while they were marked down.  These are the type of underwear to take on an extended trip where you might need to wash clothing in a hotel or B&B because they will dry fast for sure.  I'm pleased with my purchase and glad I took a chance on the size chart.UPDATE:  It has been one month since my purchase, and I really love these undies.  I love them so much I ordered 6 more (2 sets) today while they were back on lightning deals.

But, in a nutshell, I like the regular short version the best for overall comfort, sleek style and lighweightness.This hooded version is great for everyday use when its COLD outside and a hood is definitely needed or for when you're going hiking, camping or backpacking.....this hooded version would be the best.  This version looks more casual and would go with jeans or leggings better.  The Chevron is more dressier and would look nice no matter what you have on.This hooded version AND the other two I mentioned are all filled with 90% Duck Down and 10% Waterfowl Down.  The exterior fabic is 100% Nylon and the interior fabic is 100% Polyester EXCEPT on the ""Regular Short Packable Jackets"" they have 100% Nylon Interiors which is why they are a lot more lightweight than this hooded version and the Chevron version.If you're looking for an all purpose hooded jacket that will keep you warm in the low 30s then this jacket is worth purchasing.  Also, this version and the short unhooded version have logos stamped on the left sleeve at the top that is not shown in any photos.  Its a little larger than the size of a quarter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R108X6OID9WE3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XMLGI14#wasThisHelpful","R108X6OID9WE3I","A2J591OLWPBEMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J591OLWPBEMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I own several versions and colors of Calvin Klein Short Packable jackets, and this is my favorite.  First off, the ""sandstone"" color just makes you look dressy even if you're not :) And the gold tone hardware isn't overpowering as I thought it might be, so it doesn't look cheap or cheesy.  The hidden zippered pockets on this version is VERY nice and adds to the sleek look.  I own the ""packable short hooded jacket version"" and its more poofy and heavier than this one, not because of the hood but because the lining and exterior of this one is ""nylon"" and the hooded version has a ""polyester"" lining which adds to the weight.  I also own the version like this called ""chevron"" with the gold tone hardware.  Its a dressier version, but I still like this one better because this one is really lightweight. And again, the chevron version has a polyester lining.So, for this version, the exterior is 100% Nylon, Interior lining 100% Nylon, filled with 90% Duck Down and 10% Waterfowl down.  And the tags say Calvin Klein Premium Down, as I understand some Calvin Klein down jackets have less than 90% duck down so these would be a better buy.  I also understand that there are some really high premium down jackets made of 100% goose down, and in most cases cost a lot more than these do for sure.  Regardless, I really like this jacket and it fit me true to size and has a nice shape and curve.  I have short arms and the sleeves are not too long at all.  I also have the saphire blue color in this design and its a royal blue with silver hardware.  Another thing that I didn't notice in any of the photos was the fact on the left side sleeve at the top is a  round circle logo with the name ""calvin klein"" printed on it.  You can plainly see the logo on the blue and black colored ones for sure (i have several colors).  But, the sandstone one you can hardly see it because the color is a golden brown and it blends in with the color of the jacket.I purchased all my jackets when they were on sale and I would suggest buying a couple when the go on sale, like one for dressy occassions and one for a basic day out and about.  They are very nice indeed, and pack up wonderfully for traveling or backpacking.  I own a total of 4 and wouldn't hesitate to purchase a 5th one (probably a red one) at a later date.  One more thing, these jackets in my opinion are good for low 30s and above temps without any layering. Other than that layering would be a must.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IG70PWUFZWYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XMLHF34#wasThisHelpful","R2IG70PWUFZWYM","A2J591OLWPBEMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J591OLWPBEMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wear size 9 in all shoes except ankle top hiking shoes where I have to wear extra thick and cushioned socks.  Other than that I wear size 9.  So, in saying that I ordered size 9 in these rain boots too and with no socks they have lots of extra wiggle room and with thin socks they have extra wiggle room, and with semi-cushioned socks (cushion in toes/heel area) in these boots they fit absolutely wonderful.  I have full- cushion socks that I wear in my hiking boots, but those are are too thick for these boots and make a really tight fit.  So, if you truly wear a size 9 and wear thin or slightly cushioned socks then these rain boots should fit fine.  I personally don't like loose rain boots flopping all over the place, and its a sure set way to end up stumbling over your feet and falling.  With a slight snugness will offer you some stability and assurance in your footing as you walk.Now on to the style and color pattern.  I purchased the Black/White floral design and at first I didn't think these would be appealing but they were on sale and plus had a coupon discount and the only one that was about $19.00 so I took a chance and purchased this design/color.  After receiving them and trying them on with my jeans, I'm VERY happy I chose this color.  First reason, is that blue jeans really blend in with the color and make it look as though the ""black"" color is really navy blue, and since most times when its raining or wet outside, there are probably grey skies which blend in with with the ""grey"" in the boots which are NOT white by the way. It also blends in with the grey sidewalks and driveways, so these black/white boots are the best color option in my opinion if you don't want to stand out and just blend in.I'm 5'4"" and these fit right below the knee and I can wear my jeans inside or outside.  I figure if you're wearing them on the outside and water gets a little more deeper you can easily just pull your jeans up, so wearing jeans on the inside or outside to me isn't a big deal both ways are dooable.Lastly, the style on these boots are awesome and don't look like a lot of those clunky garden boots. I'm glad I waited for the price of these to go down!

"I have several of these shirts in long sleeve and short and love them. They are a thin cotton material and really airy.  They're good for everyday use when you're not trying to dress up but be comfortable in whatever you're doing. The pink color is not bold, but a muted type color which is very nice and doesn't scream summer. The sizes are accurate. I wear a large in all shirts and no exception with these bonehead shirts. And since these are made of cotton they do wrinkle, which don't bother me at all.UPDATE:  I was so excited about the pinkish color one and the first time I wore it I received several compliments while out shopping.  That's the good.  But, the UGLY is the fact on both sleeves around the seams of the arms back and front there are white splotches where it looks like the color was completely removed.  I noticed it after coming home from being out all day.  It was new when I wore it and it hadn't even been washed yet.  After washing it the white spots are still there.  I was only shopping, not hiking or doing any strenuous work. I think its weird as some of the spots or on the top of the sleeve, not a place perspiration would normally be a problem (if thats what the problem is). I'm afraid this pink shirt I purchased will ultimately completely fade and I'll have to throw it out.  I'm so dissapointed :(  I'm changing my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars.  I would even reduce it more, but I purchased several of these shirts and none of the others have faded at all.  I own the white, beige, orange, blue and the pink one. I'm contacting Columbia to see if they've received any complaints about the specific pink color one.  Maybe its the dye they used?  Other than this issues, I believe these shirts are outstanding.

"These shirts are a slight bit larger than I expected and mainly because of the draping style (as shown in the product image). I guess I was expecting them to be a little more fitted.  However, they do look really NICE and the fabric feels nice too.  These shirts would be perfect for traveling which is why I purchased the (black and purple).  Another thing, the sleeves are exceptionally long, and to correct that problem the cuff buttons need to be relocated which is what I plan to do. I initially planned on returning the two shirts I purchased and get a medium but I don't think that would change how long the sleeves are so I'll just fix the button location.  I'm 5'4"" 160, 38c for reference. The shirt slightly drapes but doesn't look big and its very comfortable for extended movement.  If you're under medium to short height the shirt tail will cover the upper part of your bottom side, more than what the product image shows in this photo.  The model in the product page must be tall with a long arms and a long torso, as the shirt looks shorter on her, which is not the case for a medium to short person wearing this shirt. Oh, and I really like the hidden pocket that zips on the side seam. A nice little place to stash a small amount of cash while out site-seeing so you don't have to constantly open your purse for small purchases in high pickpocketing areas in europe or any country/region with high condensed tourist areas. The pocket will hold a driver's license, credit card, bus/tram pass, or a single key, but I would personally only put a little cash in there for convenience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KP5H2SNLD6KN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2J1ZDE#wasThisHelpful","R2KP5H2SNLD6KN","A2J591OLWPBEMQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J591OLWPBEMQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The critic Mark Schorer often talked about ""technique as discovery"". By that, he meant that the techniques an artist uses can better or worsen the revelation of the story being told. With a subtitle like ""Mastering Storytelling Techniques"", one might think that Barry Braverman would tell us how to use technique to better tell stories with video. Unfortunately, he does not. Instead, Braverman's book is a collection of tips on operating a camera, philosophical and critical impressions of equipment and sarcastic remarks.I've come to expect that a book on technique will develop itself in a logical way with each concept building on the prior until a foundation is laid, and then adding additional concepts. Instead, the author seems to have gathered random ideas, classified them into chapters and then not organized them further. Along the way, he uses many acronyms without explaining what they mean, or ideas that only an experienced user will understand, and never explains them.I am not the most experienced videographer but I hoped to get something from this book. I kept at it, hoping that by the time I reached the last chapter it would all make sense. It didn't.The format of the book reflects its lack of organization. Each chapter has a number of subheadings separated from what went before by a rule and the headings were often terrible puns as when the small paragraph on fill lights is captioned ""Having Your Fill"". Moreover, the continuity of reading is disrupted by the hundreds of illustrations sprinkled randomly across the pages, often making it difficult to follow the text. They are often less than two or three inches wide and hard to make out. Moreover many do nothing to demonstrate the point of the accompanying text, while others are visual puns that I didn't find funny or useful, and still others include text over the image, as if previously used in a Power Point presentation, that are not appropriate for an illustration in a printed book.I'm sure Braverman knows his business. Perhaps very experienced videographers will understand some of the highly technical matters he discusses, although if they are that experienced, I can't see that they need this book. The less experienced videographer should not spend time wading through this disorganized book","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OPKIC1RRB0R1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0240825179#wasThisHelpful","R3OPKIC1RRB0R1","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every year I attend a big photography exposition. Last year there was just one drone exhibitor. This year there were more than a half dozen. Drone photography seems to be here.Eric Cheng is a drone apostle, having spread the word of the uses and advantages of drone photography, including as a representative of the largest ready-to-fly drone manufacturer, DJI. His book covers all aspects of drone photography, although for a few demonstrations, there are references to on-line videos. The book includes chapters on equipment, learning to fly, aerial stills photography, aerial videography, real world stories (which is a portfolio of still drone photographs), and flight, policy and travel (which discusses the status of rules applicable to drone flight as well as how to travel with a drone). This is the most comprehensive book on drone photography Ive seen.Before going on, I have to confess that I had been opposed to the use of the word drone to describe these aircraft, preferring unmanned aerial vehicle because of the negative connotations associated with the word.  Now, given the rapidly growing positive uses of these platforms, even though there is also an undercurrent of fear and distrust in the public, drone seems unavoidable.The book uses DJIs Phantom 3 Professional for many examples. This is not an unreasonable choice, given how DJIs drone dominates the market. The book also deals only with ready-to-fly drones and not the hobbyists assembled drones.The chapter on learning to fly is really just a familiarization, given the number of drone options available. In my case after experimenting with an inexpensive toy drone, I had to resort to the manufacturers publications and videos as well as many on-line resources before I felt competent.(Perhaps not so competent; in speeches Cheng warns that drones are vulnerable. The toy drone that I lost in a tall pine tree and the two Phantoms that drowned might challenge that competence.)With regard to both still photography and videography, Cheng emphasizes that it is useful to think of a drone as a three dimensional device to put ones camera into a position to capture images. He discusses the limitations and capabilities of drones, but to fully utilize a drone, one will have to go beyond the discussion in this book. For example, although the author discusses the HDR capability of the Phantom 3, one ought to understand both how to shoot and process HDR photographs.Chengs discussion of the regulatory environment is important to drone pilots, to insure they are not breaking the law or public expectations. He acknowledges that this is a rapidly changing situation and urges monitoring this environment.A while ago I reviewed this books companion Learn-by-Video and complained that it did very little educating. This book is far superior. You will still have to look at other sources to learn to fly a drone and use tools like Intelligent Orientation Control but this book will provide a good foundation for newcomers and contain a tip or two for more experienced pilots.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TOOOQO9EGLRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0134122771#wasThisHelpful","R2TOOOQO9EGLRZ","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its very natural for serious artists to think about following art as a career. And even folks who dont care if they make a cent from their art want their work to be seen or heard.The author is a former gallery owner who explains how to go about following a career in the visual arts. There are chapters on everything from setting goals, to finding galleries to pricing your work. There is also a chapter of comments by some forty folks in the art world who answered the authors question Whats one thing you know now that you wish youd learned sooner?If youve never thought about what is involved in an art career, this book will give you a broad overview of whats involved, but provides no real depth. For example the acme for many artists is a gallery show. Sloans advice is to follow the submission instructions on the gallerys web site or elsewhere. Unfortunately theres no discussion of how to prepare a submission. Many galleries want an initial submission of photographs. The author could have discussed what kinds of photographs, how to have them made and so forth, but Sloan doesnt touch this level of detail. Moreover, my own experience is that a live presentation is often more successful than a mailed-in portfolio of images, and that its useful for your friends who already have a gallerists ear to suggest an interview.Sloan seems to be leery of written contracts with galleries, but written contracts insure that the parties know whats expected of them. At the very least there should be extensive discussions and perhaps e-mails that describe each partys responsibilities.Sloan says its important for artists to have a budget and keep track of finances. Thats good advice. She mentions that she kept track of her finances on an Excel spreadsheet. Most people would mention using Quicken or similar financial software.I know its important to tell artists to follow their dreams but I really wish Sloan had hammered home that the artist has to keep his or her self alive and that before making a decision to pursue a career in art one should ask how one will eat. Whether its a trust fund, a day job, a supportive mate, or an unusually successful career, many would-be artists go a long way down the road before confronting the question. Maybe this is self-evident but its still important advice.If youve never thought about a career in art, this little book will serve as a nice introduction, but if you are still thinking of following a career in art after reading it, youve got a lot more reading to do.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OXYZPN36KRY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1514628449#wasThisHelpful","R1OXYZPN36KRY7","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ho, hum, I thought, another book on portraits. Then, after I finished the first chapter, I began to wonder what there was left to teach. By the time I reached the last page, I was surprised to find a lot of useful information that I had never encountered, at least in this form, before. SHA-BANG!Hurley is a photographer of head-shots that actors submit while searching for work. (Other folks, like executives use Hurley too, but thespians seem to be his main customers.) At the beginning of the book he explains how he sets up his lighting to get his signature style. I felt like he was teaching the reader how to make pictures that looked like they were taken by Peter Hurley. But, where most portrait books ended, Hurley was just starting, PEOPLE!He followed up by an explanation of his posing techniques, like establishing a strong jaw line and having the subjects squinch. (The squinch is a technique of having the subject raise lower eyelids just a bit, which the author says makes them look confident, but I felt made them look doubting.) The last part of the book explained how the author made people feel comfortable in front of the camera and distracted them, essentially by acting silly. PEOPLE, I had never seen such a detailed explanation of getting people to look good in front of the camera. Of course, other photographers may not feel as comfortable as Hurley in being silly to relax subjects, but having seen Hurleys techniques, more restrained photographers may develop their own techniques for relaxing people and, SHA-BANG!At first I was put off by Hurleys presentation style, sounding like a TV pitchman selling soap or knives. Then I began to see it as Hurleys tool for holding the readers attention while he drilled his method into our head, and then, SHA-BANG, I began to appreciate it.I wouldnt call this a book for advanced portraitists, but you certainly will have to understand how to use your camera. Hurley will then tell you how to work your subject, PEOPLE.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q12PST22ITTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133928519#wasThisHelpful","R3Q12PST22ITTG","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most photographers probably take photographs of buildings at one time or another but they do not think of themselves as architectural photographers. Yet most photographers would benefit from a little more knowledge of photographing structures. There are a few photographers who spend more time with structures than the average and this book is aimed at them.After an introduction, which includes a brief history of architectural photography, Schulz examines the equipment to use, including cameras, lenses and accessories; shooting techniques with considerations like perspective, converging verticals and lens focal length; and image processing. The book is profusely illustrated with photographs, which can be quite useful if the reader can learn from the images of others, because Schulz never really tells us what makes a good architectural photograph. There are also several pages of comments by another architectural photographer, Marcus Brecht, although much of it repeats what Schulz tells us.Schulz points out that there may be inherent conflicts between architects and photographers because the architect wants to capture what his art has done, while the photographer may want to make the image into his own art without consideration of the inherent art of the subject. The author specifies that it is important for the photographer to remember which goal is the purpose of his photograph.In discussing things like the importance of converging verticals and perspective, the author offers useful suggestions for dealing with problems the photographer may encounter. It is clear he believes that the best lens one can use for architectural photography is a tilt-shift lens, but the reader won't learn the details of using such a lens in this book. Although he mentions the Schelmflug principal, he doesn't explain it, perhaps because he believes controlling the plane is focus is not so useful in architectural photography.There is a brief section on indoor architectural photography, but there was little discussion of lighting such images.I was unhappy with the section on post processing. I did not expect a complete guide to using Photoshop, but rather an explanation of those unusual Photoshop tools that have particular applicability. While he mentioned such tools, his explanations were cursory. Given that he used a couple of specific images to follow in Photoshop, it would have been useful to provide downloadable images, and tutorials that are more extensive. I was also surprised that in his discussion of HDR there was no mention of the tools included in Lightroom. I know this facility only appeared in version 6, which was only recently released, but other authors managed to get advance versions of the software and include it in their books.Although I was less than satisfied with this book, I have to recommend it because there are so few other good books available about architectural photography.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R80D8JMV54ZPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937538761#wasThisHelpful","R80D8JMV54ZPW","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Guy Tal bids fair to becoming the Marcus Aurelius of the landscape photography world. This book consists of a number of essays which apparently first appeared on his blog, in which he explores the meaning of photography, art, life and all of that.The book is divided into four parts: Art, Craft, Experiences and Meditations, although ideas often  overlap between essays. Several themes run through. Photographs that merely represent beauty are not art (nor are the photographers artists) unless the photographer brings something of himself into the art that carries it beyond representation. The best preparation to bring oneself into images is by experiencing the world and other art. The mental outlook that makes a better photographer will also lead to a better life. In the latter part of the book, the author tells how much he loves the wilderness and the small town he lives in. In the last part of the book he emphasizes how small and insignificant humans are compared to the universe.Each essay begins with a quotation from a famous person, usually philosophical in nature, and then consists of several pages relating to the subject matter of the quote. The book is also illustrated with Tal's photographs, although only spread horizontally on a single page in the midst of an essay. Even though the photographs are often striking, this is certainly not a portfolio.It would be easy to think of the author as a bit pretentious, especially given how formal his language feels. Yet, when he discusses the difference between representation and art, he hits the nail squarely on the head. In fact, I was so influenced by the earlier essays in the book that I found myself asking whether I was an artist or representer, and vowing to take a different approach to my photography.On the other hand his paeans to being a solitary individual in the wilderness began to make him sound like an anchorite and his talk of how we all live on the edge of the abyss, while meant to be positive, can be a downer. And yet, even with all of these negative features, the essays are a pleasure to read. They seem to have been carefully honed so that there were no loop holes. Even though they seemed a bit preachy, a good sermon can still be pleasing, at the very least, as literature. The essays are thought provoking and it may be best to read just one at a time and then allow a bit of time for reflection.Many photography books tell us about technique. Fewer are about the mind set of photographers. Very few challenge our perception of photography as an art. For the photographer willing to accept this challenge, this can lead to both better photography and better living.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBVI8SJAXR312/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937538826#wasThisHelpful","RBVI8SJAXR312","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes an artist deliberately sets out to create art within a specific set of constraints. Certainly this is true of Tilo Gockel who determined to shot elaborate flash images with just one light, and apparently with the least expensive lights he could find. This book tells of his experience.The book begins with a very general description of the flash techniques and equipment the author uses and then goes on to a series of what he calls workshops that are descriptions of particular type images he photographed. These shots are divided into photographs of people, objects and food and drinks. There is also a miscellaneous section that covers things like stroboscopic effects and melding two flashes into one for stronger light.Although I can understand that some photographers might want to economize by using the inexpensive lights Gockel uses, it seems to me that, if one can afford the more expensive dedicated systems available today, with features like through-the-lens metered output and remote control of other units, the flexibility that one loses in using these cheaper units is scarcely worth the savings. On the other hand, most of the techniques that the author applies will also work with more adaptable units. (Much of the flash equipment was made in China and is apparently available to Gockel in Germany but not readily available in the United States, at least under the brand names that Gockel uses.)The workshops are usually four to six pages, first telling you what you will learn, then describing the location, equipment and lighting, followed by a discussion of post-processing and then tips and tricks. Each workshop is profusely illustrated, although I found the screen saves of the Adobe menus to be a little small.All of the techniques seem workable, including the more exotic ones that illuminate the pretty models that dominate the people section. I wondered why one would want to limit one's self to a single flash for food photography when the elaborate setups would only be justified for commercial purposes. Still, I have foodie friends who regularly photograph their meals when dining out, if only with their I-Phones.I'm ambivalent about this book. I did pick up a few good ideas for flash photography, although I was surprised by a misleading statement about what I consider a basic.

"It's not often that the author of a technical photography book competes with himself. But that's what Scott Kelby may appear to be doing, since he's already written a Lightroom book for another publisher.This book is a tip book that lists questions one might have while working in Lightroom, like, how do I change the background color of a photobook? The book is organized into broad chapters like ""How to Use the Brushes"" and ""How to Create Special Effects"" (although some Lightroom users might not consider creating an HDR image a special effect). In case you are not sure which chapter to look in there is a good index. The book is fairly thorough and covers most (but not all) of the problems a user might encounter.I usually don't like tip books, but this one appears better than most, since a good number of the problems one might encounter are listed. One could almost learn to use Lightroom using this book, but I've found that tutorial books, like Kelby's other Lightroom book, with practical exercises on downloaded files are better as a pedagogical matter. Instead this seems to me the kind of book you keep near the computer for those times when you forget how to do something. (Of course, if your tutorial book has a good index, that should do the job as well).I also found that some of the author's explanations were a little skimpy. For example he suggested that if one didn't want to manually search the list of keywords to find the one you are looking for, one could use the Library filter bar. I find it much easier to use the Keyword List Panel entry bar.I was a bit shocked at Kelby's disdain for the Slideshow function of Lightroom. Of course, if one wants to do a full-court press on a slideshow, one can use one of the many dedicated pieces of software. But I've found that even for polished slideshows the Slideshow function is good enough, integrates nicely with the rest of Lightroom, and doesn't require laying out more bucks. Inclusion in Lightroom is a real bargain, even if it doesn't do all the big boys do.I'm cribbing from something Kelby once said when I say this is a good Lightroom second book, when you've already learned how to use Lightroom.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI0SMFSDEIC3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937538931#wasThisHelpful","RI0SMFSDEIC3K","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lightroom is one of the most popular pieces of software available for people who want to process their digital images. It has an easy-to-use interface. If you learn to use Lightroom from a book like Scott Kelby's ""The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC Book for Digital Photographers (Voices That Matter)"" you can improve the quality of your images in a short time.  But if you really want to squeeze the most out of the software then you need a book like ""The Digital Negative"".The Digital Negative deals with just the image processing functions of Lightroom and Camera Raw, the plug-in that comes with Photoshop, which shares a processing engine with Lightroom, although the interface is different. Schewe also covers some of the uses of Photoshop for photograph processing that are beyond the capabilities of Lightroom and Adobe Camera Raw.After an introduction to Lightroom and Camera Raw processing, the author goes down the list of processing functions of the programs, covering the functions of each panel, usually in far more detail then one finds in an introductory book. (including the newest function, dehaze). Then he explains how he processes a variety of images, with his explanations of why he moved the sliders and buttons the way he did. Schewe then explains how he move images into Photoshop for the processing that can't be done in Lightroom and Camera Raw. The author finishes up with a discussion of his own workflows and even suggestions for speeding up the software functioning.This is not a book for beginners. In fact, to get the most out of this book one ought to have some familiarity with the software discussed. The author's method is to present an image that requires processing and then to discuss what adjustments need to be made to enhance the image. Since he doesn't walk the reader through the image step by step, like Kelby, it is essential that one have familiarity with the panels and the results one can expect from moving a slider. But if one is familiar with the software, one can learn just how to use it to get more artful images. Schewe's language is as simple and understandable as one can expect for this more advanced topic.The book doesn't provide downloadable images to use in tutorials, nor given the author's approach, is that necessary. Buried deep within the book (a sidebar on P.163), there is the address of a companion website where one can download a few of the images and examine the final images to see the settings Schewe actually used, but I didn't find this to be particularly helpful. Moreover it's just as well the author doesn't rely upon the reader being concerned with specific numerical settings because the screen shots of the panels required examination with a magnifying glass to see clearly.I almost wish that Camera Raw had not been discussed, because of the dangers of confusing it with Lightroom, but Schewe does a good job of distinguishing them. He does show that there are some things that you can do with an image moved into Photoshop with Camera Raw that you can't do with Lightroom.The Photoshop section deals with just a few tools to improve an image beyond Lightroom and Camera Raw. Some are pretty familiar, but the suggestions for selective sharpening may require several readings to comprehend.Notwithstanding the blurb on the back cover, this is not a book for beginners. On the other hand, once you have a handle on Lightroom, Camera Raw, and for the fifth chapter, Photoshop, this book should help you to improve the quality of your images.By the way, the great Ansel Adams wrote an influential book called ""The Negative"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22V0STMVL746Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0134033175#wasThisHelpful","R22V0STMVL746Y","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a number of good books about wildlife photography that deal with photographic techniques, like focusing, exposure and composition. Fewer deal with what I call field craft, that is, taking care of one's self in the wilderness at least as well as your equipment and then finding and getting close enough to the wildlife to capture the image.Joseph Classen deals almost exclusively with field craft in this book. After an introduction showing the relationship between photography and hunting, he talks about researching the target animal and the importance of safety. There is a discussion of field gear including self-defense (!), bags, cooking and the like, and then specialty gear like clothing, scent, blinds and calls and decoys. He urges the photographer to practice before the big shoot, and discusses scouting the shooting location. Classen considers the two techniques of stalking and waiting for animals. Next are a few thoughts on the actual shoot, and its follow-up, both on site and at home, where, curiously given his avoidance of photographic technique, he discusses editing the images.Unfortunately, the book seems aimed at photographers who are going to be introduced into an extremely wild habitat where survival will be an important element. Places like the more well-traveled national parks are not disdained, but looked on only as places to practice wildlife photography. On top of that, most of the recommendations are generic. For example, the author tells us to research a target animal on the web, but offers no specific hints of places to look, or even the type of Google searches that help. For approaching animals, other than the suggestion that one use heel-toe walking to avoid sounding human, there is little advice other than to be prepared to walk or crawl into position. It would have been useful for the author to provide some specific examples of how he deals with particular animals.As to animal images they are all of the mega-fauna that hang out in Classen's area of Alaska and are rather pedestrian. I'm not certain that the author's advice would even be useful in say, Uganda. Some of the images are laughable, like a photograph of a person reading a book to support the point that the reader should research his target species. I certainly didn't need two small images of helicopters accompanying the text that tells me that rescue in the wilderness may be difficult.Even though I've photographed plenty of wildlife, I hoped to learn a few tips that went beyond common sense and what I could figure out on my own. I didn't.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27D4OWFIO81N6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608959139#wasThisHelpful","R27D4OWFIO81N6","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"China Mieville is one of the cleverest and smartest writers of speculative fiction. From ""Perdido Street Station"" to ""The City & the City"" he often uses his tales to illuminate cultural and economic situations. ( I still think of ""Iron Council"" as being an exposition of the difficulties of anarchy). Moreover, he is not afraid to experiment with both form and language.""Three Moments of an Explosion"" is a collection of short stories that are so varied that I have to conclude that most of them were written to experiment with style. On the one hand he plays with language, like Joyce in ""Finnegan's Wake"", and on the other he tells a straight tale with a twist in the end reminiscent of the Hitchcock television show. He shifts point of view from participants, to observers to third parties from story to story. For many of the stories, it's difficult to give examples without revealing spoilers because the strangeness of the stories begins right with the exposition.Many of the forms did not work for me as stories. There are a number of ""trailers"" for movies that don't exist yet, or at most exist only in Mieville's mind, that show a concern for setting a tone, or perhaps for mocking the trailers for real movies. It was interesting to see this form of exposition of an idea, even if I didn't get the idea. There were also a few stories that seemed to be quite straight forward in the telling that left me asking after I finished, ""What happened here?""This book will be of greatest interest to the author's fans, because it will illustrate how much he experiments with developing his ideas and will increase their appreciation of his past and future work. Non-fans will certainly find a few stories that they will enjoy, but may be perplexed by as many more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R334X7XFRDMZ9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=110188472X#wasThisHelpful","R334X7XFRDMZ9Q","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I previously reviewed the second edition of this book, and gave a favorable review. This edition adds a new speedlight and several newer cameras to the lineup of items in the Nikon Creative Lighting System (CLS). (CLS is the Nikon system that allows for the controlling of multiple flashes from a single point.) Rather than create a new review of this excellent book, I'm going to copy heavily from my old review, with a few additional points.The book deals with each of the Nikon speedlights and cameras capable of being used with the system, including discontinued models. After a brief background review and quick start guide, the author delves into the nature of flash, and then offers separate chapters on the SB-500, 600, 700, 800, 900 and 910 speedlights. There is also a chapter on the SU-800 commander, the SB R-200 flashes and Nikon's ring-light kit. Each of these chapters explains each and every button, switch, and menu on these units in sufficient detail to use them properly, including Hagen's recommendations on settings. The images of the equipment and screens are ample to show what must be done. The author recognizes the complexity of the equipment and offers a linear plan for using the equipment to accomplish the lighting task. He also explains the cameras that fit into the system and how to set them. Examples are provided, with the general details of how CLS was used, and finally there are recommendations for ancillary equipment like umbrellas and stands and even batteries.One of the best things about the book is that it concentrates on the automated processes of the speedlights (although it does cover manual set-up as well.) Given the ease and accuracy of the automated systems developed by the Nikon engineers, it makes sense to rely upon these systems as much as possible rather than return to the dark ages of guide number calculation. On the other hand, Hagen provides information on manual flash, including guide numbers.The task Hagen deals with is immense since each of the pieces of equipment is quite complex in its own right. Readers only need read the instructions for the pieces of equipment they own since matters applicable to all are covered in separate chapters. Hagen's writing is quite clear, and leaves no unanswered questions about the operation of particular pieces of equipment. On the other hand this really is a technical manual about the equipment. The examples of actual application of the equipment are useful but can only give a taste of what is possible. To get the most out of the equipment requires further reading on possible set-ups, like the excellent series of books by Joe McNally. However, no book is better than this one at explaining the technical side of CLS.I note that some of the images of the screens on the back of the speedlights are a little dark. I realize that this is true of the actual screens, but in the interests of ease of reading, it would have been nice if the images had been brightened a little.I noted a few small typos, like the omission of the D800 from a long list of CLS capable cameras, but the camera was covered in the actual discussion so I don't consider the typos critical.A question owners of the 2nd edition might ask is, should I update to the third edition. If you've added a flash that was not covered in the 2d edition my answer is yes. If, on the other hand, you had a CLS capable camera covered by the 2d edition and have upgraded the camera, you probably are familiar enough with the system so that you don't need this book. On the other hand, if you have Nikon CLS equipment and don't have any edition, you should probably buy this book.In the interest of full disclosure, the book is sponsored by Nikonians, an on-line independent bulletin board (and much more) for Nikon camera users. I have been a member of the organization for many years and serve as the moderator of its books and magazine forum.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZP00OMOLFZK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937538664#wasThisHelpful","R1ZP00OMOLFZK4","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've taken an interest in using the video capabilities of my DSLR camera. My grandson has indicated an interest in ""getting into video"", whatever that means. That made an introductory book on Video Production interesting to me.""Video Production 101"" looks like the introductory book for a course in video that its authors meant it to be. The chapter headings give no hint as to what each chapter contains, and sometimes it's difficult to guess from reading the section headings. What the book does is provide a broad brush view of every aspect of video, from creating a story to capturing an image. Most of this is very general so that if you are interested in learning how to edit clips you will learn that it can be done using software but not how to do it. If you came to this book wondering how to use a camera to capture an image, you won't learn here. You will learn the difference between a close-up and a long shot and you will learn that there are controls on the camera that let you adjust focus and aperture, but not how to apply that knowledge.At first, one might think that is not very practical. But if you approach video from a particular skill, like say writing, you will understand how that skill fits into the larger world of video and that should help you to be a better writer for video. If you know nothing about video but are interested in getting a general  background, this book will do the job.It is clear that the book is aimed at people hoping to make a career out of video. It is an introductory textbook, after all. However, many parts of the book will be of interest even to folks who think of themselves as just watchers. For example, a section called ""The Poetry of Content Creation"" discusses the characters in a story and the structure of stories. This information may hone your critical skills as a watcher. The explanation of the job titles of people who are involved in video production will at the least help you understand the categories for which Oscars and Emmys are handed out.Occasionally the authors dipped into technical information that was far more specific than most of the book, as when they explained how to handle conversations in a sound track to cover up room sound. I found the information, which I had never encountered before, useful for my own editing, although it might be too much for, say, a writer.The writing is easy to understand and interesting, perhaps because it is keyed to a general audience.This isn't a book that will teach you a lot of specific video skills. However, if you are getting into video production, it will provide you with the kind of overview you will need to do a good job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YX19LUF4H2GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0321990196#wasThisHelpful","R1YX19LUF4H2GR","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The idea of street photography seems easy. You get an impromptu photograph of someone on the street. That shouldn't require much thought, it might seem, until one has tried to do it, and returns with a sad collection of uninteresting images. There seems to be a real need for photographers interested in doing this kind of work to get some help as the publisher presumed when he asked the author to create this book.The author offers chapters that talk about things like cameras and technique, look at the work of a few practitioners, suggest places where one can take street photographs, and discuss the styles of street photography. Lewis finishes up with his ideas on what makes a great street photograph. But most of this boils down to: have a small, unobtrusive camera; learn to work fast, at a moment's notice; and have a deep reserve of chutzpa to take pictures of complete strangers with or without their knowledge. A large supply of luck is also desirable. And yet with all of that, anyone who has tried (but not persevered) at street photography can tell you that you won't get many good pictures.That's because street photography has to have content and knowing how to find it, recognize it  and capture it probably can't be found in a book. Looking for something strange or wonderful is probably good, but some of the great street photographers have looked at the ordinary and in looking,  made it extraordinary. In fact the most useful tool for a street photographer may be an inquiring mind. As folks say about tennis, or anything else that requires great skill, you've got to do it 10,000 times and you still may not master it. So far I haven't found much street photography skill between the covers of a book, although spending as much time as possible with masters like Henri Cartier-Bresson, or Elliot Erwitt, or Garry Winogrand can certainly help. I would have had greater confidence in Lewis' advice if his own photographs had approached closer to those greats.That's not to say that this book can't help you become a street photographer. It does tell you the basics of the set-up of street photography, and if you haven't been able to figure that out from looking at street photographs, or you need a little encouragement, the book can be useful. Just don't expect to read this book and take great (or even good) street photos. After you've shot 10,000 you can decide if the book helps.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E6IUASO9RSTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937538370#wasThisHelpful","R3E6IUASO9RSTW","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the most difficult things for new digital photographers to realize is that it is hard to get the picture on one's monitor to look like the output of one's printer. That's because there is enough variation in one brand and model of a monitor and various printers and kinds of paper that a color management process for output is essential.As a part of the color management process a person needs to adjust the color controls of the monitor to a standard. The controls are on the monitor, but what setting will bring them to standard? That's the role of the Spyder 5. (There are a few high end monitors with built in calibration but they are pretty expensive.)One downloads software from the manufacturer, plugs the Spyder 5 into a USB slot on the computer, hangs the Spyder so that it dangles on the face of the screen and a number of colored panels appear on the monitor screen. The software calculates the adjustments that are necessary to adjust the monitor to standard and then creates a display profile that reflects these adjustments. This then becomes the default color setting for the display. It's all pretty automatic.You still need to recalibrate your monitor every so often. (Datacolor recommends every two weeks; I find every month to work for me; if you are shooting products for advertising you may want to do it more frequently.) The longest part of this process is usually taking the device out of its box and plugging it in.That's not the end of color correction though. For your printer or projector you also have to use the correct profile. For printers, these profiles can usually be downloaded from the paper manufacturer for the particular paper and printer, and then selected in the printing process. In most cases the colors are fairly close if you selected the right profile. Sometimes you want even more accurate color correction for a printer and then you can order a custom profile. But one should remember that the monitor presents color from a rear light while the print uses reflected light, so images are seldom exactly the same.For a projector, a different profile has to be created. The Spyder 5 Elite can do that, although not some of its less expensive brethren. Profiling a projector is a little more time-consuming because you have to set up the projector and mount the device on a tripod.I've used a Spyder for years and been quite satisfied. I compared screens calibrated with my old Spyder 3 Pro and my new Spyder 5 Elite and I can't see the difference. However, my old Spyder 3 could not be used to calibrate my projector, so that's a real advantage of the Spyder 5 Elite.By the way, if you are having trouble with matching monitor and output I found Tom Ashe's ""Color Management & Quality Output: Working with Color from Camera to Display to Print: (The Digital Imaging Masters Series)"" to be helpful.I don't see how anyone serious about their images can work without a calibration device. The Spyder 5 Elite is easy to use and works if you have a good color management process. The Elite is particularly helpful because you can calibrate a projector with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTMUJBLCZRN7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBSL3L6#wasThisHelpful","RTMUJBLCZRN7O","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who has tried to fly a DJI Phantom that provides a view through a drone-mounted camera knows it's a problem to see the screen on a device like a phone or tablet because of reflections. Anything that can cut down on that reflection is a help. It's also a help for first person views if you can follow the action on a large size tablet. All of this seems to make a good argument for this item.At the same time, it's not realistic to think that a shade alone will solve the problem. You don't need a class in optics to know that any kind of light reflects. All you can do is mitigate the worst reflections unless you want to look at the screen through a hole in a box, which the FAA would take a dim view of with their requirement to keep visual contact with unmanned aerial vehicles.This device does about as well as could be hoped to increase screen visibility. I also found that it helps a little more if you add a non-reflective screen to your tablet. But even in the best of circumstances, there will be some reflections. Positioning yourself with respect to the sky can also help. The device comes with the necessary attachments to affix the screen and tablet to either the controller for the Phantom or a tripod. I found that attaching a large tablet to the controller so shifted the center of balance of the controller that it made it difficult to use. I found it much better, if less convenient for movement, to attach it to a tripod. Unfortunately, the tripod mount is 1/4 inch so if your tripod has a 3/8 screw you will need to get an adapter.I tried the device with several tablets and it held all of them comfortably, all though I had to remove the a thick cover from one. I did have difficulty not dislodging the tablet when I had it attached do the controller.Ultimately, I ended up using my mobile phone on the controller most times, as a matter of convenience.If you don't mind mounting your tablet on a tripod this is an ideal device. Physics make this a poorer choice for mounting directly on the controller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NKI7JC36RVS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O6AY86C#wasThisHelpful","R1NKI7JC36RVS8","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you think of how many DSLRs include a capability to shoot video, you might also think that there would be great demand for a book concentrating in this capability. From the title, you might also think that this would be the book to satisfy that demand.The chapter headings might further that conclusion. After all, there are chapters on gear, lens use, sound and even editing. However this book is not aimed at the average DSLR owner who might want to occasionally film, say, a family gathering. Instead the book is aimed at digital filmmakers making everything from television advertisements to full length movies who might want to capitalize on the differences between most older digital video cameras and DSLRs. The differences include the larger sensor in digital cameras and the smaller depth of field achievable by DSLRs thanks to larger f/stops. There is enough difference between older video cameras and DSLRs to make it important for the video maker to understand how this will affect his images. The author presumes the reader knows about digital video cameras and only emphasizes the differences in techniques when using a DSLR. Because of this presumption there is little actual instruction on how to make a video, but plenty of advice on how to adapt one's practices. There is little about adapting DSLRs to particular genres, although there are two curious appendices on underwater photography and rigging a camera to a car.As I read this, I remembered the saying that generals trained their troops to fight the last war. At this time the manufacturers of video cameras are changing their products to incorporate larger sensors and larger f/stops. In fact the point may already have been reached where the price of such a camera is similar to that of adding the necessary accessories to use a DSLR for sophisticated video making. Nevertheless there probably is still a large group of video makers who plan to give DSLR video a chance and this book will ease them into the technical side of that.As a DSLR still photographer, I was reminded that video is essentially JPEG rather than RAW and that as a result a great deal of testing is necessary to make sure one selects the right settings to give the desired look to the image. I also was reminded that focusing was still problematic for DSLRs in video mode and that setting up and pulling focus are as difficult or even more difficult than with regular video cameras.I was struck by the fact that the author did not find it useful to describe some of his subject in detail. For, example although dollies were discussed throughout the book, there were no illustrations of dollies.I also found that many of the author's warnings were needlessly repeated several times, and that, as far as the relationship between the focal length of lenses and depth of field, the author failed to mention the function of image size and repeated this omission every time he mentioned the subject. Since depth of field is one of the main reasons for shooting DSLR video, I found this omission surprising.If one understand that this book is aimed at the digital video maker who is new to DSLRs, this book can be a great help, even if a bit repetitious.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT0PPVFSVKTJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118983491#wasThisHelpful","RT0PPVFSVKTJR","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though Lightroom is one of the more friendly pieces of image processing software around, there are still times when a user can't remember how to do something, or guesses that there might be a better way to do it, or really wants to delve deeper into one of its functions. That is where Martin Evening comes in.This book provides a comprehensive look at Lightroom's functions. It's more like an encyclopedia than an instruction manual. Oh, there are chapters available that follow right along with the Lightroom workflow process from intake to output. It is possible to introduce one's self to Lightroom with this book.  But unlike, say, Scott Kelby's The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC Book for Digital Photographers (Voices That Matter), there are no tutorials as such. Instead the entries read more like an encyclopedia, although arranged by workflow rather than alphabet. One really needs to know a little bit about how Lightroom works before this book proves most useful. If you don't you may not even know what to look up.This book comes into its own once you start using the software.  There is even an appendix that includes a section on hacking Lightroom. (Don't do it; as Evening explains there are easier, less dangerous ways to customize the software.) The author often illustrates his points with images showing the starting point and the effect of an adjustment that was made.An example of Evening's going a step beyond is his discussion of camera calibration. He not only explains what Lightroom camera calibration is, but even tells you how to create a custom calibration.

"Although I've been using Lightroom since the day it was born, I'm certain there are many photographers who have never used post-processing software before and will start to do so with Lightroom CC/Lightroom 6. (Lightroom CC is the rental version; Lightroom 6 is the purchase version.) I'm equally sure that despite the fact that Lightroom is still one of the most user-friendly tools around, some of these same folks will be looking for a guide. At first glance, I thought this book might be the answer.The book has chapters that deal with all of the modules, each of which has some specialty, like Library, Develop and Slide Show. Using a special code, the reader may download files to work with during the lessons. Most of the lessons do not include every nuance of Lightroom's tools, and that's not surprising. To do so would overwhelm the reader. But....In capturing images with cameras with controls it is essential to learn how to set exposure. It's not enough to read that the shutter speed dial changes the length of time the shutter is open to admit light. Good photography books explain the three-legged relationship of shutter, aperture and ISO and how the selection of each can affect the image. For post-processing software, an equivalent tool affects the tonality of the image. It's not enough to explain that moving the exposure slider in the Basic Panel affects overall brightness. Whole books have been written about the tonality controls. Two pages are just not enough.There are sections of the book that are adequate. The key-wording section is certainly adequate, although eventually a user will want to learn more. On the other hand, the section on pan-and-scan in the slideshow section doesn't reveal that checking this box will result in the so-called ""Ken Burns"" effect being applied to every single slide in the show.For experienced users who just want to learn what's new in Lightroom CC/Lightroom 6 and how to use the new features, the instructions are so skimpy that you can do as well just experimenting, and certainly other books like The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC/Lightroom 6 Book by Martin Evening will be a far better investment.A beginner could start out with this book and even learn a lot about Lightroom but they will miss some essential information. There are better books to introduce the beginner to Lightroom 6. They may take a little longer to read and to do the exercises but they won't leave a person feeling that Lightroom is too hard to understand. One I would recommend is ""The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC Book for Digital Photographers (Voices That Matter)"" by Scott Kelby.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REHTOKD46DA85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133924823#wasThisHelpful","REHTOKD46DA85","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like the rising of the sun, I can't imagine the release of a new version of Lightroom without Peachpit releasing several books explaining the software. This is one of the best of the beginner's books (with perhaps something for more experienced users) about Lightroom 6. (Lightroom CC is the Rental Version of Lightroom 6)If you've never used Lightroom before, this volume does a fine job introducing it. Lightroom includes various modules that do things like catalog images, manipulate the data to make more attractive pictures, and output those images in a variety of forms from images for the internet, prints, web pages and even books. The author follows the process in the same order as a photographer using the software would from taking the image files into the program to outputting them to a variety of media. The author provides several pages for each functions, and provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the function with commentary on the outside of the page and screen captures closer to the gutter. Images are available to download from the publisher's website so that you can follow along step by step. There is no skimping on the instruction so you won't have any surprises.For example, tonality is one of the key steps in post processing images and the author provides enough detail so that you will not only be able to follow his instructions for dealing with the sample images, but also to understand how the process works.  Kelby has been providing post-processing instruction for many years in many books and the process he uses is time-tested, Moreover, he is willing to tell you when a particular function is weak or impractical which can be a lot of help. At the beginning of every chapter he tries to provide a humorous introduction, which some people may find sophomoric, but these flights are short.For long-time users of Lightroom, there are a few new functions, and Lightroom is so user friendly that the operation of some of the new functions, like panoramas and HDR, will be intuitive and not require explanation, so that those long-time users might think they don't need this kind of introduction. I've been using Lightroom since the first version and I thought I was accomplished. Imagine my surprise (and embarrassment) on reading the text to discover that Lightroom contained several facilities which could have made my post-processing life easier if I had picked up on them.Most Lightroom 6 books haven't even hit the market yet, but I feel confident in saying that a new user who starts his or her Lightroom life with this book won't be disappointed. Experienced users may also find something they didn't know in this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ML5WRWG3JCTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133979792#wasThisHelpful","R2ML5WRWG3JCTR","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For many years I suspected that that strange intersection of ontology, epistemology and semiotics called ""photography theory"" might be of some use to practicing photographers. I was surprised when I encountered photography theory in the guise of a ""how-to"" photography book.I was quite excited when the book began by explaining that photography was communication. I expected the book to show me how technique could be used to enhance communication. Chapters followed on composition, the mechanics of the camera, exposure, light, how to look, the relationship of the image to time, the digital darkroom, presentation, a bit more on composition, how to think and write about images, types of assignments, particularly portraits and a couple of addenda on safety and careers. The book contained many illustrations by many photographers together with what appeared to be extracts of the photographers' artists' statements.Unfortunately none of this information told me how to use the material under discussion to further communication. For example, the chapter on the mechanics of the camera explained what physical effects occurred when various controls were employed, but not how to use these effects for communications. The chapter on the digital darkroom described various tools and panels in Photoshop, but not how to use them to enhance an image. The chapter on thinking about photography described problem solving techniques that sounded like the most basic self-help book. On the other hand, occasionally there would be a surprising specificity as in a description of how to use the timeline facility in Photoshop.The photographic illustrations were small and seldom appeared to have any connection to the textual material. Moreover, few of the images were what Ansel Adams described as ""straight photography"", but rather were of the more experimental variety, based as often on connotations exclusive to the photographer, but not available to the viewer, and of little use as a learning tool without far more explanation and clarification by the authors.It may be because no single theme pervaded the book but I found the writing quite boring.There may be interesting issues of ontology, epistemology and semiotics here for the philosopher of photography who has exhausted all the main texts. For the practicing photographer there are far, far better books to read to create a more communicative image.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UXGPIRT0G9LD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=024081827X#wasThisHelpful","R1UXGPIRT0G9LD","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Freeman has always been one of the more thoughtful writers about taking photographs. Many of his most recent books have focused on just one small part of the skills of image capture. This one is in the same vein.The book is basically about the right moment to press the shutter button to get the best image. After an introduction that concentrates on the factors defining that moment (urgency, precision and speed) and the different kinds of shooters (Firemen, Builders and Marksmen) he presents a variety of his photographs, categorizing them by the type of moment, like slotting in place, or mid-air moment, or color moment and then discussing the considerations he used in selecting the moment. He further describes which of the factors was applicable to the particular situation and image, and then provides other information, like a series of images from which the principle photograph was selected, or clarifying graphics to support the point he is trying to make.This is a book about composition, and while there may be mention of why the author selected a particular exposure or focus to capture the moment, there is no discussion of basic exposure or focusing or indeed any other kind of basic technique instruction. If you don't already understand these basics, the book will be difficult to understand, making it more useful to practiced photographers.Freeman's photographs are accessible and well chosen to illustrate his points. I often feel that a series of photographs by the author may be telling one how to photograph like him or her,  but, as Freeman says, although a ""scene is unique...this is supposed to prepare you for something similar"". It might seem that the concept of moment is most applicable to documentary photographers but Freeman includes photographs from a variety of genres from nature photography to landscape to portraiture to illustrate the idea's applicability. And even though it was only a paragraph, I took a moment of glee from the way that Freeman indicated his disinterest in Bernd (whom he calls Bernard) and Hilla Becher's deadpan industrial typologies.I do confess that the graphic he includes in every discussion showing the relative urgency, precision and speed, while at first clever, appeared after a while to be overkill, but it only took up a small part of the page, and it did make the author's points.After one gets the basic skills of photography down, it becomes much harder to learn anything new, especially about ways to think about your photographic composition. I found this book was able to get me to consider more about the moment to snap the picture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D3PML9F50263/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1138832480#wasThisHelpful","R2D3PML9F50263","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It may be a bit churlish of me to criticize this book since it answered the question of whether I should add a GoPro to my camera bag. On the other hand, it often seemed like a long advertisement for GoPro.The book has seven chapters: a primer on the camera; a discussion of mounts; angles to shoot each activity; a bit about capturing a story; editing; story analysis, and methods of sharing GoPro videos. Most pages show a bit of text on one side and a lovely photograph on the other. Many of the points include links to GoPro videos, with a choice of a URL, a QR code, or for me the most convenient, a page on the publisher's web site with links to the videos. These videos are all exciting, and perhaps can provide inspiration to GoPro usersMost of the book was too general to be of much help to a beginner. For instance, the primer chapter, where one would expect to find a description of GoPro cameras and accessories does not even include a single picture of a camera or the accessories that exist, let alone camera features, but rather just discusses frame rates and resolution. The lengthy chapter on mounts does not illustrate a single mount but rather just images captured using the mounts. The same is true of the chapter on angles, although the text explains how to use the mounts to get the angles. The chapter on editing doesn't explain very much on how to edit, although there is a nice discussion of cuts. The same sort of generalities without specifics pervade the entire book.If you are an experienced GoPro user this can serve as an idea book. A beginner will have a harder time understanding how to get the most out of his GoPro, although his aspiration level will undoubtedly increase from watching the videos.By the way, after finishing the book, I decided the GoPro was not for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9G044HF3UCS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0321934164#wasThisHelpful","R9G044HF3UCS1","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Immediately after I finished reading ""The Essence of Photography: Seeing and Creativity"", I turned to the copy of ""Visual Symphony"", an early book by Bruce Barnbaum that has graced my coffee table for more than thirty years, and paged through it. I was heartbroken.I had hoped that ""Essence"" would give me an insight into Barnbaum's creativity that would allow me to give further life to my own photography. It did not.The photographs in ""Essence"" are wonderful, and a careful perusal of them will give the viewer great pleasure, and hopefully extend the vision of a viewing photographer. If you don't have a book of Barnbaum's images, their inclusion here would justify purchasing this book. They are in the style of the f/64 school, which included Ansel Adams and Edward Weston, but with the author's own individual stamp. On the other hand, one may be better off just skipping the text.I blame myself. I see how many of the arts use the same techniques: focus on the subject; explicate with the details; know what you want to communicate. My error was that I thought that skill as a photographer might lead to skill as a writer. Instead what I found was a rambling memoir, not organized to make points, and not edited tightly to avoid the extraneous. Still, there was just enough clarity to show that Barnbaum's ideas jibbed with other accomplished photographers, although in a few cases, his suggestions seemed rooted in the past. For example he suggests that the photographer should learn to work slowly, i.e., not just grab the first image encountered, but continually think about what better techniques can be applied to a situation and what adjustments to make, both technical and spatially, that will more fully reveal one's vision. But then the author suggests that a way to do this is to return to film and view cameras and perhaps even the chemical darkroom.  That ship has sailed. The digital camera is small and convenient and it's a natural response to press the shutter button and let 'em rip. Returning to the past seems an inefficient way to slow down the digital photographer.Barnbaum teaches workshops and I am certain many of his students may rush to his defense. Once again, skill teaching a workshop doesn't mean skill as a writer. If you want to feel his influence, take one of his workshops.In summary, great images and boring text.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJE8MTCG2HZ1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937538516#wasThisHelpful","RJE8MTCG2HZ1N","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A good portrait shows the viewer something more than just the exterior of a person. I read the second edition of this book to see if the authors could tell me how to do that.The book is technical in nature and takes a classical approach to the subject. After a brief history of portraiture, it explores the nature of lighting the portrait with respect to the placement of lighting equipment and the play of light and shadow on the face of the subject. Next the authors explore setting the proper exposure, and lighting ratios. The authors explore the planes of the human face and lighting patterns for the face. They explain lighting setups, with from one light to several. The authors discuss backgrounds, mixed natural and electronic flash, composition, posing and facial analysis and finish with advice on relating to the subject. The book is illustrated with sets of images of an illuminated bust and a single main model and photographs by a variety of famous and should-be-famous portraitists.Light is really the heart of the book. Equipment is discussed generically, so if you want to know about what electronic flash to use or how a light stand works you will have to go elsewhere. But assuming you know how your equipment works, and understand fundamentals like exposure and focusing, the concepts presented here should enable one to capture a good portrait.In the review of a prior edition I complained that the authors referred regularly to the use of an incident light meter and ignored the reflective light meter found in most cameras but this has been remedied. There is still reference to light ratios, which seem a slight anomaly in the digital age, but I now see how a familiarity with the topic can help a digital photographer in his or her setup.I'm happy to report there is no discussion of putting babies in cute hats or piling up suit cases in the woods. On the other hand there is little discussion of how to convert one's vision of the soul of the subject into a lighting pattern, but I have yet to come upon a book that does that. Perhaps the only way to learn that is to study the great portraitists in photography, drawing, painting and so forth.If you understand that with portraits, as with all photography, it is the handling of light that allows the photographer to express his or her vision, this book will be of value to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IK8EPK5S0Y4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937538575#wasThisHelpful","R2IK8EPK5S0Y4G","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want to hear your MP3 player on the subway, or play a video game and not disturb other people, or even watch late night TV without bothering your neighbors, headphones may be a good choice for you. They certainly sound a lot better than earbuds.These phones are of the supra-aural type, i.e., they lay on the ears rather than surrounding the ears. One probably gets a better sound with full size headphones that encircle the ear, but they are usually a little heavier. On the other hand, the pressure of the supra-aurals may be uncomfortable after long use. These phones are also closed back, which means better bass, but reduces of the likelihood of hearing any outside sound, which may be good or bad depending on your needs. The earpieces twist and fold so that the set can make a smaller package that can fit into a brief case (or a pocket if one doesn't mind a big bulge). The headband is adjustable for different size heads.I tested the phones with smart phone, computer and sound system. They did relatively well acoustically in all circumstances. If you are playing a slam-bang video game with lots of shots and explosion this set is all you need, although the 1.2 meter cord may be a little short. On the other hand if you are listening to music or a movie with a good sound track you may want a little more. I tested the phones with the director's cut of ""Blade Runner"", especially the sequence with Zhora in the Taffey Lewis bar. (If you haven't seen ""Blade Runner"" the following might be a spoiler.) On a stereo or surround sound speaker system the noise in the bar encloses you, but with the phones there seemed to be a small gap in the middle. When Zhora broke through the store windows you could hear the breaking of glass but none of the high-pitched overtones of the tinkling pieces. On the other hand when Deckard fired his gun, there was a convincing boom.Ergonomically the hand band literally gave me a pain. I'm bald and the headband scratched a little. Folks with a head of hair probably won't face this problem.The connecting plug is 3.5 mm, so if you use Apple devices, you will need a conversion plug.All in all, this was a perfectly fine set of headphones in a competitive field. Better -sounding phones are available but not to my knowledge in this price range.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CHXPI2A5TN1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMLXIDG#wasThisHelpful","R1CHXPI2A5TN1E","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading this book, I thought that Jay Maisel might be better described as a photophile than a photographer because it's clear he is deeply in love with the play of light. If you want to get the feeling of Jay Maisel the artist, view the YouTube video of Maisel by George Lange.The book is a portfolio of this artist's work. On the right side (and sometimes the left) of the gutter is a single, page-filling image. Usually to the left of the gutter, there is a short pithy comment about the photograph that reveals his no-nonsense, Brooklyn-accented view of the photograph, photography and perhaps the world. Maisel has been a great teacher of photography but don't look for instruction about technique. Instead you will hear him telling you to always carry the camera, to look, look, look and to shoot, shoot, shoot.It would be easy to classify him as a street photographer or perhaps a generalist, but better to think of him as a looker and seer of everything. The images run from light patterns on a wall to a child, almost always in glorious color. I think of Maisel as an abstract photographer, not because his photographs don't look like reality, but because he's not as much concerned with the content as with it's explication by light and color. (I'm not certain what he means by ""gesture"" although it has something to do with the essence of the subject, but one doesn't need to understand his use of the word to appreciate his work.)I could describe one of his images, but it wouldn't do the picture justice.

"Somehow I imagined that fine art portraits would look like the images of Yousuf Karsh or Irving Penn or Richard Avedon. Little did I realize that the images of Mylora Bruleigh would be little concerned with revealing her subjects, and more concerned with capturing an artsy, sometimes eerie, look more like the work of a painter concerned with affect and not capturing the person. These pictures are highly stylized, somewhat surrealistic and apparently designed for competitions or galleries.The book consists of a number of two page spreads, with a narrative and intermediate photos on the left and her final image or images on the right. In her narrative, she describes in broad general terms what she visualized for the photographs and how she achieved her vision. The narrative also includes a small box describing her shooting data. The initial photograph is the start of the process but there are then many steps in Photoshop and other pieces of software including plug-ins on the way to her look.I have to confess that I don't like this type of photography, but I also admit that the author is clearly an artist for whom a photograph is just a starting point. I was horrified by the picture of a pregnant women hanging in a crucifixion pose, and even more so to learn that the women was a client looking for something different. Other photographs included women bathing in milk in what Bruleigh calls an ""Underwater Visual Imaging Tank."" (I looked it up on-line to see if it was commercially available, but then learned it had been constructed by her husband.) At first the idea sounded strange, but the opaque milk cuts off the submerged parts of the body, creating an interesting figure. All of the photographs are of women, including some young girls. The author dresses them in vintage clothing, cheesecloth and even bubble wrap. The pictures are mostly either high key or low key. Browns seem to predominate.Photoshop techniques she regularly uses include folding one half of a figure over to the other side to make a bilaterally symmetrical figure. She then nudges limbs and figures into place. She frequently adds a texture layer to images. I would have appreciated more detail on her Photoshop techniques, but she only speaks in broad generalities.As far as I was concerned this book was more of a portfolio or idea book then a how-to book. Photographers interested in creating images that are way off the beaten track may find this book interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30V3NFE4GA2FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608957675#wasThisHelpful","R30V3NFE4GA2FM","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I often complain that many books about photography show readers techniques for capturing and processing images but don't show the reader enough examples of how to apply the techniques. This is a book that shows us how to apply what the others teach.As I read it, I kept wondering why the publisher had elected to use shock tactics in the title. As the authors acknowledge, the pictures in this book are good pictures, that the authors show how to make better. The pictures were submitted by the members of the Cleveland Photographic Society. Each image (or sometimes set of images) shows an original image, and then sometimes a subsequent image by the same photographer that improved upon the original image, either by taking a different picture or post-processing.  The authors then made further improvements by post-processing. (Occasionally the authors conceded that the image did not need further improvement.) I don't want to insult the many good photographers who contributed images, but not many rose to the level of great art, and a few, after substantial improvement were just good. Still, even these kinds of before and after pictures can be quite useful to see how images can be improved.Some of the improvement techniques, like changing the shooting position or cropping were pretty obvious from the photos, while some of the post-processing suggestions were more subtle, but careful scrutiny as well as the text revealed how the improvements had been made. I consider this approach an excellent supplement to the usual instructional approach of teaching a technique and then showing a photograph demonstrating the technique.On the other hand, particularly with regard to post-processing, one had to already have developed some skills in order to benefit from the authors' approach. They usually describe the post-processing technique in general terms, as when they advise to darken a portion of the image. Given that digital photographers use different software programs to process their images, and that most perform similar functions, while using different tools, such broad descriptions give the general technique more applicability. On the other hand, if, say, one doesn't know how to apply a gradient, that instruction will only help if one scurries back to one's software and figures out how to use the appropriate tool. That's not to fault the book but suggests the appropriate audience.The book is organized into chapters, like ""Creative Cropping"" and ""Getting Up Close"", each with several examples, but it's almost impossible to fit the images into such neat boxes, especially since many examples used several different techniques.I applaud the authors for taking a different pedagogical approach. The more experienced photographers who seem to be the audience for this book may not be exactly able to home in on the information that will prove most useful for filling out their toolbox of skills, but the book should still prove of use.I suppose a book entitled ""Your Photos are Okay"" would not have had as much of a marketing cachet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15TNBILG7FNJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1305084454#wasThisHelpful","R15TNBILG7FNJB","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I strongly suspect that if one were able to clear one's mind, as Zen Buddhism suggests, one might be able to focus on the world in such a way that one might capture better photographs, although at the same time perhaps those photographs might be better for the artist than for other viewers. The author of this book might agree with me.Early in the book the author suggests that he is not dealing with Zen as a religion but as a philosophy, and I might go a step further and say that he is considering a practice of Zen called zazen, a form of meditation that requires quiet contemplation. ( I tread lightly to avoid offending those who practice Zen Buddhism.) By this form of meditation, it is said, one frees oneself from distracting thoughts to enable one to focus. This focus will allow you to see the world more clearly and therefore take or capture or visualize better images.The author suggests that zazen allows us to be free of the scientific, logical mind to engage the world. And yet he seems to see the contradiction here, since the process of creating an image requires technique to reveal content, both of which are aspects of the logical mind. To me, the suggestion of the title that photography can be meditation is misleading. It can be like meditation, in that many good photographers are focused on the image, but most do not show the detachment from the world that is a result of zazen.The main text consists mostly of two page spreads with plenty of white space that could probably be read in an hour if not for the photographs. These images appear to relate to the text although some times the image comment deals more with technique or content. Many of the images look like Chinese or Japanese brush and ink drawings, while others are overly dark and brooding. The colored images at the end of the book seemed derivative of Hiroshi Sugimoto. Most of the images seemed affected.Someone has said that the most important piece of equipment that a photographer has is located behind the view finder. Just as a photographer might want to select an appropriate camera body or lens for his or her work, so he or she might want to prepare the mind for making a photograph. Many people have suggested that zazen is a useful tool for this. Hoffman's book is no better than several other books about photography and Zen. Indeed the photographer with more than a passing interest in Zen as mental preparation might do better to read the works of D.T. Suzuki and John Daido Loori. For others still looking for a way to develop their photography this book might be a stimulus to explore the ways of Zen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VD2RAWQ3ZACP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937538532#wasThisHelpful","R2VD2RAWQ3ZACP","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like Adobe Camera Raw (ACR), Lightroom lets the photographer convert images from a RAW format to images that can be printed, e-mailed and so forth as well as adjusted for tonality and color. But unlike ACR, Lightroom also provides other functions, including a strong image cataloging facility. Peter Krogh, who has been made his bones writing about the management of digital images, has recently turned his attention to the cataloging and filing of images in Lightroom.In this e-book Krogh tells us all about the management of image files in Lightroom, including an exploration of the nature of Lightroom catalogs; suggestions on file structures; using ratings, filters and collections; keywording; adding location metadata; and even managing derivative files. All of the instructions are supported by in-line videos of Lightroom screen shots that demonstrate the techniques, which allow the reader to just click on the image in the PDF to see the video. Both the text and the videos are easy to understand, and the videos provide the perfect illustration. Unfortunately in this e-book (with the exception of a few videos), he has not followed the procedure of his prior e-book, ""Multi-catalog Workflow with Lightroom 5"" where each video was followed by a text summary, which allowed you to skip videos whose content you were familiar with, or just return to the text for a quick reminder.Several procedures offered by Krogh surprised me. For example, the author sets forth as a basic rule that image files should only be moved by Lightroom. However, he suggests that, when moving to a bigger external drive, one should move the image files with the operating system rather than Lightroom and then have Lightroom relocate the files. It works, but I would have liked the author to discuss moving files to a new drive in Lightroom.I wished that there had been a little more information on several aspects of Lightroom like using the painter tool. I also would have liked a few reminders such as that when one checks ""Remove Location Information"" on the metadata section of the Export Menu, it will not remove locations that have been saved as keywords, so that one should remember to make sure ""include on export"" is not checked in the key word add or edit menu for those location keywords.At first glance this e-book does not appear to offer much more on the asset management functions of Lightroom then several other books. But as I read more of it I found techniques that I had never considered, like setting up special smart collections to find specific unkeyworded images. The clear writing and videos and considerations from the ground up will help Lightroom beginners. More experienced hands are likely to find a few Lightroom asset management techniques that will make Lightroom even more useful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4DUMMCZ04SAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098985146X#wasThisHelpful","R4DUMMCZ04SAR","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More and more photographers are, with good reason, using Lightroom for the initial processing of their digital images. But there are a lot of possible image processing solutions that Lightroom does poorly, like local adjustments with the clunky adjustment brush, or not at all, like assembling panoramas. To use these solutions, many photographers turn to Adobe Photoshop and its layers features.Juergin Gulbins describes in detail all of the aspects of layers including their use to make global and selective adjustments, the use of layer masks, blending modes, smart objects and smart filters, layer styles, and layer organization. He discusses alternatives to layers and then provides five examples of image edits. The author assumes that the reader has a basic familiarity with Photoshop.I had mixed feelings about this book. From time to time the author will give detailed instructions on a technique that he is using to enhance an image and at other times the instructions are cursory. For example in his discussion of adjustment layers, he does not mention all of the available Photoshop adjustment layers and their controls, a subject that would probably be of the most interest to those using Photoshop to further refine their Lightroom processed images. Similarly, his discussion of blending modes explains what they are, but not how each of the blending modes works, and when it might be appropriate to select a particular blending mode to enhance an image. Moreover, a quick look at the many steps that Gulbins is willing to apply to a simple image may reveal that he is willing to work harder to extract that last 2% from an image than most photographers.On the other hand, he is frank in stating that of the four tone-mapping methods provided in Photoshop for HDR images, only Local Adaptation seems really useful. Similarly he is not reluctant to suggest that other software like Photomatix Pro for processing HDR images and PTGui for panoramas may be more useful than Photoshop. He often offers examples and solutions that one may not have encountered anywhere else, like simulating a pencil drawing using divide modes or using smart objects to insert or remove details in a portrait.I would have liked to have seen more examples showing when to select particular options for a tool. I eventually learned that downloadable images were available so that one could follow more complex procedures at the computer but that was only when I reached a small reference under Resources at the back of the book.This book is not for the beginning or perhaps even the intermediate Photoshop user. For advanced users there is always a danger that an expert's Photoshop procedures will not be original for the reader, or that the technique will not be applicable to a particular photographer's genres, but that seems to me an unavoidable risk. I would certainly recommend this book for perusal by an advanced Photoshop user, keeping in mind the difficulty of learning anything new at that level.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PMDMU90Z1UQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937538273#wasThisHelpful","R2PMDMU90Z1UQY","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom (not to be confused with just ""Adobe Photoshop"") is a great piece of software that allows photographers not just to catalog their work, or turn it into all kinds of media, but to process their raw files to adjust color and tonality to make their photographs look like their vision. The interface is a lot easier to use then its big brother Photoshop but there are things that are harder to do in Lightroom, like make local adjustments to a part of the image, or that can't be done at all, like join images to make a panorama. That's why a lot of photographers use both pieces of software to process their images.Scott Kelby's ""Photoshop for Lightroom Users"" looks just like the knowledge store to allow Lightroom users to learn how to use the senior software to do those things Lightroom can't do. The book starts with a very quick walk-through of Photoshop tools like selections, layers and cloning. There is a chapter on moving images back and forth between Lightroom and Photoshop and some of the Photoshop tools that are not available in Lightroom like panorama creation and high dynamic range processing. Additional chapters show how to retouch portraits, create composites, apply special effects and sharpen images. There is even a chapter explaining effects that you don't have to go into Photoshop to achieve.Kelby's tutorials are masterful, taking you step by illustrated step to achieve a result, and there is even a website with the images used in the tutorials that can be downloaded to follow the tutorial on your own computer. I learned how to more effectively use a few tools that I thought I had mastered.The big however is that the instructions are inadequate if you are a beginner who wants to learn how to use Photoshop. For example, when it comes to creating layers, selections, adjustment layers and masks that will allow the image globally processed in Lightroom to be locally adjusted, the material is condensed to just a few paragraphs and not all of the adjustment layers are even covered. Better for the photographer new to Photoshop to get a good Photoshop introductory text, and learn how to transfer images back and forth between Lightroom and Photoshop in a Lightroom text.Rather than teaching the reader how to use Photoshop, Kelby ends up providing us with a series of tips on how to perform specific tasks, like straighten teeth in a portrait. Normally I dislike tip books, but the quality of the tutorials that explain these tips is so high that I found some that might help even a more experienced user. The problem is that there is not enough information here for the beginning or intermediate user to learn how to use Photoshop to improve Lightroom-processed images. If you are a Lightroom user looking to learn Photoshop, this is a bad place to start. A more experienced Photoshop user might benefit from going through the tutorials, to find out Kelby's suggested methods for accomplishing more complex tasks, and perhaps discover a few worthwhile tips, but he or she will have to wade through a lot of fundamental material, which, while not adequate as an introduction to Photoshop, will seem like old hat to that experienced user.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11QO74VDGERSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0321968700#wasThisHelpful","R11QO74VDGERSA","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Essick has a difficult job. He must make beautiful photographs that reveal the way mankind is destroying its environment. That he does so is quite amazing, although he must give the lie to the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words. It is often only by reading the text on the full page opposite an image that we realize that a photo is laden with doom and gloom.Essick has the dream job of many a photographer. He works the environmental beat for National Geographic. He apparently travels the world searching for images that tell us that humans are fouling their own nest. Were the images not so well made, this book might almost be overwhelmingly depressing, especially since the photographer offers few solutions to the many problems. Perhaps the photographer doesn't want to acknowledge that we can only prevent environmental disaster by giving up some of the extravagances, and even what we might consider necessities, of modern life.Although the book is replete with great images, my favorite is a view of Butte, Montana. The image is divided into thirds from right to left, foreground to background. In the right foreground is a shingled house with a window through which a young boy is looking. In the center, middle ground is a deteriorated wood-board structure. On the left and background is a part of Butte, filled with tipples and mine heads and either an open pit-mine or piles of tailings. One can only wonder what future the boy will face in this damaged landscape.What a contrast this makes to a book released by the same publisher a month earlier, Jack Dykinga's ""Capture the Magic: Train Your Eye, Improve Your Photographic Composition"". Dykinga's book looks at untouched nature, often growing and surviving in a harsh desert, but full of the feeling that nature can gloriously survive. Essick makes us wonder if even with all of our greatest works, the planet can survive.The book is not a technical manual, although occasionally the discussion will touch on technique. There is also a section on technical information giving as much capture data as the author has (many of the images being pre-digital). The most important part of this work is that Essick is asking us to face up to the fact that we are failing at our job of stewardship.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LLB1TMQN12Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937538346#wasThisHelpful","R2LLB1TMQN12Q3","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Early in ""The Traveling Photographer"" author Sandra Petrowitz tells us that travel photography is really landscape photography, portraiture, architectural photography, photojournalism and so on. She also tells us that the main task of the traveling photographer is to capture something new other than the standard postcard or iconic shots that everyone takes.The book then proceeds through a basic introduction to photographic composition, including off-center photography, filling the frame, point-of view (which she calls perspective, a term some other photographers reserve for the effects of angle-of-view of different focal length lenses), placing the horizon, removing clutter and so forth. She describes the gear she uses, mainly a DSLR with a several lenses (although she also recommends supplementing this with a compact camera) and a good tripod. With a nod to the digital age she recommends backing up one's images. She concludes that it's okay to take a day off from photography when one is on vacation.Thus the book is mostly a primer on composition and seems more appropriate for the traveler going on vacation to brush up on composition. There is no general discussion of basics like exposure or focusing. The book is well illustrated, mostly with the author's photographs, but her pictures do not rise to the level of works by a photographer like Art Wolfe. In an already crowded field of basic books on composition her book is acceptable but nothing out of the ordinary.It's too bad that after identifying that the main problem of the traveling photographer is finding a new take, she couldn't tell us how to do that, other than to be alert for the opportunity. She might for example have given us a few of the special lessons of the many genres that make up travel photography. Of course it's easier to say that than to do that, and the ability to ""make it new, make it mine"" is what distinguishes the great photographers from the rest of us.All in all, this is a nice guide to composition for the traveling photographer, but nothing out of the ordinary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34U9RMK53K3GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937538338#wasThisHelpful","R34U9RMK53K3GE","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the good things about university presses is that they often print material that commercial publishers wouldn't consider. One of the bad things is that often this material is not as good as what the commercial presses would print.As a wildlife photographer, I sometimes think of myself as practicing a form of field biology while creating art, so the secondary title intrigued me. The author is a noted herpetologist (a zoologist dealing with reptiles and amphibians.) The book itself is a combination of memoir and explication of the science of herpetology. In the memoir he describes his career and the people he found fascinating along the way. The science focuses mainly on snakes, answering questions like what are the largest snakes and how do snakes apply their venom.There were parts of the books that I found particularly interesting, especially descriptions of places I've also been like La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica and the Grand Canyon as seen from a raft (although I did wonder why a man who professed to enjoying the raft trip got off at the half way point rather than continuing down to Lake Mead.) But then I realized that my pleasure derived from my memory of those places rather than his descriptions. The book was also full of obviously loving descriptions of herpetologists the author encountered along his life-trip, although their lives started to blend in my mind, since they sounded like those of dozens of other academics I've met.I found the descriptions of reptile behavior interesting but randomly organized. Perhaps I would have found that topic more interesting if I had read Greene's award-winning book ""Snakes: The Evolution of Mystery in Nature"".A lengthy, minutely-described diary of several days of hunting seemed like a defense of an action one might find suspect in a biologist, even though the true conservationist can appreciate the importance of reducing untrammeled growth of some species in a predator-free environment.The question of what the art is in field biology is never fully answered although the author suggests that the title question, apparently selected before the volume was completed, is more of a tickler than the focus of the book.I suppose a young person interested in making a career as an academic in field biology might find this book interesting, as would Greene's friends, colleagues and students. The rest of us will have to look elsewhere to find the art in field biology.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MRP4IBRBQB7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0520232755#wasThisHelpful","R3MRP4IBRBQB7H","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes the credentials of authors are as important as the content of their works. Art Wolfe is one of the great outdoor photographers, and in recent years, he has been working wonderfully in other genres. Rob Sheppard, an excellent photographer and former editor of Outdoor Photographer magazine, is a keen wordsmith. Any photography book coming from these two is worth the attention of other photographers.The Art of Photography is aimed at teaching inexperienced photographers about image composition. There are chapters on inspiration, subjects, image design, equipment (to the extent it influences composition) and so forth. There is even a brief section on workflow, suggesting the order of considerations in making a photograph and then processing it in Lightroom. The book is illustrated with Wolfes elegant photographs and Wolfe himself has written a brief autobiography as well as short comments at the end of each chapter about particular photographs or series of photographs. Sheppard provides most of textual instructional material in a clear, easily understood manner that is practical.The book aims at fundamentals and frankly has a lot of competition from other books that cover the same ground because most photography educators agree on the extent and content of the fundamentals. Occasionally the book strays beyond the fundamentals as when it discusses compositing pictures in Photoshop, but this seems to be more to alert the tyro photographer as to what he or she can look forward to as skills develop rather than to actually instruct. In the same vein are the discussions of Lightroom software. Even a whole book devoted to that subject would still leave room for further instruction. But be wary of the title; it will be probably be a long time before a beginning reader will be able to capture Art like Art Wolfe.Still, for a photographer who has not yet absorbed all the fundamentals, this book ranks at the top of the list. Experienced photographers are unlikely to learn anything new, although they may benefit from the authors frequently repeated advice to break out of a limited view of subjects and composition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SXCEJ77OOM6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DAD26SI#wasThisHelpful","R3SXCEJ77OOM6V","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was a lad, photographs and movies were all in black and white. When color film was introduced folks were full of ohs and ahs, but soon color became the norm. Photographers concentrated on tone and contrast and line and tipped their hat to color, but since those days when color came into common use, few articulated any grand theory of the use of color to make better images. Now Jared Foster has turned his attention to this aspect of photography.The author begins by singing colors praises, telling the reader it is cultural, emotional and physiological. He briefly tries to explain the science of color, without scientific explanation, and then tells readers an image may contain small dots of color or large areas of color. Foster tells photographers they can use color together with the rule of thirds, leading lines and framing. He explains the color wheel, analogous colors, and complimentary colors. He runs through a list of primary and secondary colors, telling us what emotional freight is supposedly attached to each. Foster then talks about how certain colors or combinations have cultural associations. There then follows a miscellany of thoughts about lighting conditions, and about some basic camera and post processing settings that will effect color like shooting in camera raw and calibrating the monitor. His final chapter offers a few hints on when to convert a color image to black and white.Mostly, Foster talks around the subject, without ever giving specific suggestions about how to use color to structure the image to realize ones vision. Instead he just keeps urging one to keep color in mind. Other instructional manuals do as much in briefer, non-repetitive form.Photographic composition is highly subjective, but other authors have found the way to organize their thoughts about composition to present a clear framework for approaching the subject. At first I wondered if Foster simply needed to better organize his material, but after rereading I realized the author really had no comprehensive theory for the use of color, like, say, Harald Mante. Instead Foster keeps repeating Keep color in mind. Thats a shame, because I suspect that many photographers could benefit from a comprehensive, organized approach to color.At the same time one might still find this book useful. Color is important. There are ways to use it to build better images. So, even if the reader cant walk away with an overall approach to color, he or she might benefit from a reading just by becoming more sensitized to this subject.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JYSI64HMW5HM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0321935284#wasThisHelpful","R2JYSI64HMW5HM","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very often new photographers have a hard time wrapping their mind around the fact that photographs can be taken in the dark. Some cameras have a nighttime setting, but to really get the most out of a picture taken in the dark, one needs to use other settings. Gabriel Biderman shows beginners how to do that.This book is part of the publishers From Snapshots to Great Shots series which is aimed at less experienced photographers. The book starts out by discussing equipment useful for night photography, although most of it is the kind a serious photographer would already have (except perhaps for a film camera; lack of such a device shouldnt deter anyone from venturing into the dark). Next is a discussion of the nature of exposure, followed by a chapter on composition. There is a chapter on how one can add light to a night shot, and then a collection of useful odds and ends, including such things as scouting your location and photographing fireworks. The book finishes with a brief look at post-processing in Lightroom software. (One wont learn to use Lightroom here, and if you know how to use Lightroom you wont pick up much more than a few tips which could have been covered in a single page.)  Each chapter begins with a series trademark, that is, a couple of annotated images that show the photographers considerations in making the shot. There are a list of assignments at the end of each chapter, most of which consist of advice to practice what the author preaches. There is also a Flickr site for readers to post their night-time images, which pretty much works like all Flickr sites.This book is not the most comprehensive examination available of night photography techniques. For example, even for the beginner level, I would have liked to have seen more of an explanation of the fact that with long exposures, it is possible to capture more than the eye can see at night, and what considerations this might have for the photographer. Indeed, I think the entire chapter on exposure could have had a little more confidence in the ability of the tyro to absorb.On the other hand, Ive never found a complete and comprehensive book on night photography. So recognizing that there are many levels to night photography, and that the image maker must keep working at it and learning to find all the things out there in the dark, this seems like an excellent introductory book. On the other hand, folks with a little experience with night photography wont find much new here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EWN5REGXP6NA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GN9B1PU#wasThisHelpful","R1EWN5REGXP6NA","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Make no mistake about it. Jack Dykinga is a great landscape photographer, mostly of the American West, but beyond as well to places like Patagonia and Hawaii. His earlier books inspired me to try to photograph Death Valley and the Mojave, although I will confess to cursing his name a few times when my SUV became mired in deep sand or a ditch.This latest book contains a collection of his images and purports to be an instructional manual for photographers, with his ruminations on landscape photography accompanying each of the photographs. The subjects of these thoughts include the use of lines, framing and negative space, all ideas of use to a landscape photographer.One genre of Dykinga photograph is the single small main subject, like a clump of sunflowers, in the midst of open space. Then he adds to the image by waiting for exactly the moment when the rising sun illuminates just the subject while the background is in shadow. Often, to use his phrase, he works the subject, that is, he photographs the same subject, from different angles, in different light, each time trying to express his vision of the subject. What I find most amazing is that even when viewed consecutively, all of these images appear to be beautiful, each expressing something ineffable but slightly different about the subject and all together having some synergistic effect that is more than a single vision of the subject. Still another genre is the examination of the subject, either in close-up, or at a distance, to reveal the form, almost without consideration of the content, like a photograph of the folds of hardening lava at a volcano.I admit some jealousy of the photographer spending his time in these spectacular landscapes. I could not help but wonder how he would do spending a month in New Yorks Central Park which is beautiful but not spectacular. On the other hand, even as I write this, I am resolving to go into the park to try to use what Ive learned from him.I must confess that I am slightly troubled as a reviewer by the attempt to impose the genre of instructional book on these images. Photographers can learn by examining the work of other photographers, probably with more to be learned from great works like these. The text that accompanies each picture seemed more like an explanation of what the author was thinking about and trying to achieve than instruction, and occasionally helped to crystallize my thoughts about Dykingas thoughts. But there is no organized body of instruction the way one would find in a book aimed at beginning photographers. Mostly, there are great images, with an invitation from the photographer to try to steal from him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWGP4WTC2IAEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOFW134#wasThisHelpful","RWGP4WTC2IAEB","A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yes, this dry shampoo is a bargain.  However, it's just as messy as any other spray dry shampoo and there's not much product in the can so it goes really quickly if you use it a couple of times a week.  At first, I really liked this because there was no white residue.  However, when what I sprayed didn't do anything about my oily roots, I became suspicious and read the directions, which stated that the can should be shaken up very well before using.  So that is what I did and I got a completely different product.  Yes, it's as white as snow and even after waiting 20 minutes for the powder to absorb the oil, there was a tremendous amount of visible residue.  Brushing this residue out proved to be a challenge and I was left with a grayish cast on my dark blond hair.  I ended up wearing my hair in an updo that day and what I really wanted was to immediately wash this stuff out.  I can't imagine that anyone with dark hair could ever use this product.  That said, I have since discovered another dry shampoo, a powder, that works much better than this cheap spray.  Alterna Caviar Talc Free dry shampoo is absolutely awesome and is much less messy than the spray form.  I can easily control the amount of powder and most of it is absorbed within 20 minutes, leaving very little residue to brush out.  It also gives me a nice amount of volume.  However, all dry shampoos leave a matte finish, which I'm not thrilled about, so I use a shine spray to compensate.  Yes, Alterna is more expensive than Fructis, however, there is no propellant taking up space so I highly doubt that there's much actual powder in the Fructis can.  Alterna has 2.65 ounces of pure powder (and Amazon has the best price) and although I use it twice week or so, I still have more than half a bottle left and I've had it for several months.  So it lasts a lot longer than Fructis.  My main objective in using a dry shampoo is to wash my color treated hair as little as possible.  On day 3 my roots have started to get rather oily and Alterna definitely works to absorb the oil completely, and the results are usually good for day 4 as well.  I have also used it overnight and there's almost no powder left in the morning.  I find spray dry shampoo very messy and way too much powder is dispersed making it exceedingly difficult to brush out the excess.  The sprinkle in powders work so much better and the results also last a lot longer.  I only need to use the powder on day 3 and I'm still good to go on day 4.  If you really want a good dry shampoo and want to control the amount of powder, try Alterna.  It smells really nice and it doesn't have the propellant and other harmful chemicals that the sprays do.  It's also talc free (talc is a known carcinogen) which makes it perfect for me because I'm definitely sensitive to talc.  I bought this 3 pack of Fructis, thinking I'd found a bargain.  However,I now have half of one can and two full ones that I don't know what to do with.  I suppose I could pawn them off on family and friends but why would I give them something that is so awful?  I guess they're destined for the recycle bin.  I definitely don't recommend Fructis dry shampoo.  If you want a truly awesome dry shampoo that is better than any of the sprays, then try Alterna in the purple bottle.  I will never go back to the spray dry shampoos. Fructis is a complete bust and not worth a single dollar.  The only thing going for it is the scent, which dissipates quickly and all that's left is a tremendous amount of messy white stuff.  No thanks.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R134XMWF6F5ZMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GH4JXJM#wasThisHelpful","R134XMWF6F5ZMZ","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This spray does give my hair more body and adds some thickness without being stiff or sticky.  I have a layered lob (long bob) and I was looking for a styling product that would give my hair more texture but without the stiffness of a dry texturizing spray, something that would give me some piece-y-ness and separation.  I layered this thickening spray with a styling spray (Living Proof No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray) and let my hair air dry overnight.  In the morning I use a curling iron to create loose waves.  This product definitely added some thickness to my strands and the styling spray ensured all day hold.  My hair had a lot of body and although I wouldn't say there was a lot of texture added or any true piece-y-ness, my hair did look really nice and the waves stayed in place through a 2nd day.  I like this product because it isn't stiff or crunchy and my hair was soft and manageable.  I had a little trouble with the sprayer and I hope it won't clog up again when I go to use it next time (it did unclog easily though).  I'm still trying to figure out exactly the right amount of this spray to use but I was rather generous the first time and I had good results.  I'm not sure how this product would perform if a blow dryer is used, it could be activated by heat and give tremendous results.  However, I'm not a dryer and round brush person (too uncoordinated, lol!) so the effects would be lost on me.  I do think this would be a good product for those with fine or thin hair.  It definitely added some nice thickness without weighing my hair down.  It also didn't dull the shine, which is a very good thing.  All in all, I think this is a good addition to my routine and I'm pleased with my purchase.  I definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to add some thickness without feeling like there's a lot of product in the hair.  I'm now curious about the Thickr product and wonder if the results would be even better, lol!  I guess there's always room for one more teensy product in my regimen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F41ZRK4L244E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ATQXWY#wasThisHelpful","R1F41ZRK4L244E","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't think this glaze adds much shine at all.  And the little it does add, doesn't last through a shampoo.  I've gotten much better results using Wella Color Touch Relights in /00 that is mixed with a 10 volume developer.  Wella delivers shine that lasts about 15-20 shampoos and is available on Amazon and ebay for about $10.  Mix one part /00 with 2 parts developer.  Apply to clean, dry hair for about 20 minutes.  Rinse but don't shampoo for 48 hours.  This gives the product time to set and the cuticle time to close.  Wella Color Touch does absolutely no damage and the shine is nonstop.  It also doesn't make hair dry at all like JF and it has a lot of body and is very manageable as well.  I don't know why I decided to try this JF glaze because I always use Wella, but I was curious about the product and it was on sale, so I decided to try it out.  I used it once and my hair was a tangled, dry, frazzled mess so I won't be finishing the bottle.  I wish I could return it and get my money back.  I've used Wella for a decade and now that I know just how awesome it is, I won't be trying anything else out.  I highly recommend Wella Relights but can't give more than one star to John Frieda's clear glaze.  The name itself is a misnomer because there's no shine involved at all.  I'll stick with Wella thank you.  And if you really want great shine and no damage whatsoever, try Wella.  It's super easy to apply and the shine lasts for weeks.

"I used this gloss in the cool blond shade and didn't think the results were very good at all.  My hair is a neutral dark blond but as is inevitable, golden tones subtly creep in, probably as the result of minerals in my water.  I usually use Redken Shades EQ toner in 9V, which has a violet base, but I was hoping that this JF temporary treatment would give my hair a boost (and I was out of SEQ) while I was waiting for my shipment of SEQ to come in the mail.  But this was not to be.  I followed the directions exactly but my hair came out rather ashy and very dry and frizzy with absolutely no shine.  I thought this was a luminizing glaze that was supposed to boost shine big time.  I won't bother using the rest of the bottle and will end up pitching it in the trash.  It was a total waste of money.  I had to wash my hair with a clarifying shampoo several times to get the ashy tint out.  This dried my hair out even more.  I finally revived it with a hydrating mask used with heat and a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (Agadir).  My Shades EQ in 9V (violet base) finally arrived in the mail and I couldn't be happier with the results.  It keeps my hair beautifully neutral with shine and no dryness whatsoever.  If you're looking for a colored gloss, you can't do better than Shades EQ.  SEQ has to be mixed with the SEQ processing solution, which is about $15 for a huge bottle that will last forever.  I buy SEQ from Amazon or ebay and the shipping takes about a week.  If you want results that will last 15-25 shampoos and that will neutralize golden tones, then SEQ in 9V is the way to go.  If you want a more neutral result, mix in an equal portion of 9NB.  SEQ is superior to JF in every way and the results last a long time, not just a couple of shampoos.  I hate how JF left my hair a tangled, dry, frazzled mess.  SEQ makes my hair soft and shiny and the color is glorious.  It costs me about $11 for one SEQ treatment, which is a very reasonable price.  It's a salon product and therefore gives salon worthy results.  My stylist charges $50 (plus tip) for the exact same toner and doing myself is not only cheap, it's really easy.  Mix equal parts SEQ toner and processing solution and apply to clean, damp hair.  Check every few minutes and when you see that the golden tones have been neutralized, rinse.  This could take anywhere from a couple of minutes to 20.  Don't shampoo for 48 hours.  The color needs time to set and the cuticle needs time to close and the color will last much longer if you wait.  For the longest lasting results, use a sulfate free shampoo.  SEQ leaves hair better not worse like JF.  I so wish I had just waited for my SEQ to arrive in the mail.  Now I'm out $13 for JF, which could have been spent better elsewhere.  Now I've learned my lesson: SEQ is awesome!  There's simply nothing better!  I definitely do not recommend this JF Glosser.  In my opinion, he should take it off the market.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LV90BWKTCNPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLS554Q#wasThisHelpful","R3LV90BWKTCNPM","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a terrible product,  It simply doesn't dry and slides off whenever you brush/comb and it ends up on the pillowcase at night, even though it was applied in the early morning.  I have used other root touch up products and none of them were this bad.  The dark blond shade is very brassy and the paste didn't really cover my virgin medium brown hair very well.  I have looked for a root concealing product for quite some time and have finally found one that works really well for me.  Rita Hazan Root Concealing Spray works like a charm.  The dark blond shade is a neutral shade with no orange or gold and it blends seamlessly into my part, covering not only the silver strands but my medium brown ones as well.  And it stays until I shampoo it out.  I only wash my hair about once or twice a week and I don't need to spray RH every day.  Yes, it's expensive.  However, I use so little (one quick spritz covers my part) that the small can has lasted me several months thus far and is still going strong.  I tried the root concealing powders (like Color Wow) which is just expensive eye shadow and doesn't stay on worth a damn and is time consuming to apply.  The only way I could make it work was to spray hairspray and then while the hairspray is wet, apply the powder.  This is more trouble than it's worth and Color Wow is very expensive and you don't get much powder at all and the applicator is worthless (too tiny).  I also tried Zoto's Spray root concealer from Sally's, but the dark blond shade was way too orange.  I've also tried other products with a mascara-like wand but they dried up too quickly or, in the case of Greyfree, didn't dry at all, lol!  Rita Hazan makes a much better product and I'm more than willing to pay more for something that works so well.  I wasted my money on Greyfree and even though it's not a large sum, it's still money down the drain.  So my recommendation is that you skip Greyfree altogether and spring for Rita Hazan, which is simply awesome!","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q1J4IFP5CQRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PD5QZI#wasThisHelpful","R3Q1J4IFP5CQRU","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you need to neutralize ugly golden tones in blond hair, then this is a decent toner to use. It has a violet base, which neutralizes gold, resulting in an ashier, cooler tone.  However, it won't work well unless the hair has been lightened to the pale yellow stage.  It does nothing for orange tones.  So the hair must be lifted to the color of the inside of a banana peel in order to get a platinum outcome.  However, if you mix this toner with T11, it will give a more neutral result.  This toner is mixed in a 1 to 2 ratio, with one part toner to two parts 20 volume developer.  This formulation will give some slight lift (maybe one level) depending on the person.  Apply the toner to clean damp hair and check it every minute or so. As soon as you see that the gold undertones have been neutralized, rinse well and condition.  For the longest lasting results, do not shampoo for at least 48 hours.  The color needs time to set and the cuticle needs time to close.  For longer lasting results, you can apply it to dry hair.  However, don't leave the toner on too long, otherwise the hair could absorb the violet base color and you could end up with either very gray or purple tinged tresses.  Color Charm Toner lasts anywhere from 15-25 shampoos.  A sulfate free shampoo will guarantee longer lasting results.  This toner does leave hair rather dry, so a good moisturizing mask is recommended as a regular part of your hair regimen.  Agadir and Je Veux make great hydrating formulas that work really well with heat.  You may also want to use a shampoo and conditioner with protein, which will strengthen and provide shine.  Living Proof Perfect Hair Day and Pureology Perfect 4 Platinum are excellent choices.  An intensive protein treatment, such as Apoghee Two Step from Sally's or Joico Kpak, will slightly strip the color, just fyi.  Such treatments are best used before toning to prepare the hair to receive the new color.  I have used this toner and think it's a pretty good product.  However, I've recently discovered Redken Shades EQ in 9V Platinum Ice (also with a violet base), which I think does a much better job of neutralizing gold and leaves hair in much better condition with tons of shine.  SEQ is mixed with the SEQ processing solution, not a traditional developer, but it is reasonably priced (around $15 on Amazon or ebay) and comes in a huge bottle that will last forever.  The toner runs about $10, which is also reasonable.  I like SEQ much better than Color Charm because the results are more predictable.  I used Color Charm twice and both times got different results.  The first time, the results were exactly right but the second time, they were much too ashy, although the timing was the same both times.  So I've switched to SEQ and don't regret my decision.  My hair is shiny and soft and not dry whatsoever.  You can also mix in SEQ 9NB if you want a more neutral result.  The only inconvenience is that SEQ must be ordered online and shipping takes time.  However, it's a salon product and therefore produces salon quality results.  It's what my stylist uses in her salon and she charges $50 for toner (plus tip) and it costs me about $11 to do SEQ at home.  So I am recommending Color Charm toner in T18, but only for those who absolutely cannot wait the time it takes for shipping.  Otherwise, SEQ gets my best toner recommendation without reservation because my results look salon worthy. If you absolutely must drive to Sally's right this minute, then by all means use T18.  But if you truly want the best outcome, order SEQ and be patient for a week.  I promise you it's worth the wait.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVCXORROU0FQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IAA9Z9Y#wasThisHelpful","RVCXORROU0FQ0","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I might as well have mixed up my regular color and developer to do my roots.  Although this method is less messy, the medium blond shade did not match at all and left my hair very brassy.  This product gave me ugly hot roots so I had to go ahead and use regular hair color to match the rest of my hair.  I should have known that this product would contain the same inferior drugstore hair color product that I have strenuously avoided over the last decade.  I use a salon brand of hair color, Wella Koleston Perfect, that's nothing like the box kits or the junk Sally's sells.  One of the main reasons for this is that my brown hair has a lot of underlying orange pigment that comes out when it's lightened,even two levels.  This results is a lot of warmth, i.e. orange, so I use a Koleston shade with a blue base, which neutralizes the orange.  Something that drugstore kits and Sally's brands can't do (there's no blue base available).  I wanted to touch up my roots without getting messy, but this roots touch up product is no different that using a bowl and brush.  I would much rather spend the extra $5 for my regular hair color than use this stuff again.  If I needed to remind myself why I switched from drugstore color years ago, this is the perfect time.  I will not make that mistake again.  So I ended up doing my roots twice, once with this Root Rescue garbage, and once with Koleston.  Thank goodness the Koleston product got me back to my usual shade, otherwise, I would have given this stupid product a negative star.  My advice is to touch up your obvious roots with your regular formula.  Despite its claims to do so, it cannot match the existing shade and the color choices are limited.  You'll be much better off if you just bite the bullet and do a full on touch up with your regular brand.  I'm glad I didn't waste muc money on this inferior product but even $6 is a waste if it doesn't give the results you want.  Good thing I had plenty of my usual shade on hand because I couldn't have left the house with my orange roots.  From now on, I'll just touch up the regular way.  Or use Rita Hazan's root concealing spray (which is awesome btw) in the meantime.  This product gets no recommendation from me and in fact, I advise against using it.  There's nothing worse than roots that don't match the drapes, lol!","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZP03AHUTUWXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003A874R6#wasThisHelpful","RZP03AHUTUWXI","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This developer works really well and gives me a nice even end result.  It seems to condition as it works, leaving my hair soft and supple.  I use it with Wella Koleston Perfect hair color and I haven't noticed any difference between the Koleston developer (much more expensive) and Color Charm, so I suspect that they're likely the same exact formula.  This developer gives me the proper viscosity so that the color mixture is thick and creamy and doesn't drip.  I have never used the clear formula developers, always the cream version, and this one seems to have plenty of conditioners.  It also gives me the full two levels of lift (lift is dependent on the nature of the hair and for some people this may not be true) and my hair is always shiny and soft after coloring.  So I see no reason to spend more for Koleston developer because Color Charm works just fine.  If you have a sensitive scalp, I recommend Ion Sensitive Scalp developer or you could add two packets of Sweet and Low to the color mixture.  All in all, I'll continue to use this developer, which I purchase at Sally's.  It does everything I need it to and is very inexpensive.  A great product that I definitely recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ZMECBZ8W74F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N5QWCM#wasThisHelpful","R33ZMECBZ8W74F","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just glorified eye shadow.  And the powder doesn't even stay on very well at all.  If used as directed, it wears off halfway through the day and my silver strands once again are visible.  There's also not much product in this packaging, which means it doesn't last very long at all.  The only way I can make it work is to spray a generous amount of hairspray, and while it's still wet, apply the powder.  Otherwise, the powder doesn't stick to the silver strands at all.  I color my hair dark blond and my natural color is a medium brown.  The dark blond Color Wow powder is really too warm for my neutral shade but I went ahead and used it anyway (I should have returned it immediately, my bad).  I went through a considerable amount of the powder before trying a method that worked (somewhat) and the powder never really covers the medium brown hair at all.  I used about half of this powder before giving up and buying Rita Hazan's spray root concealer in Dark Blond.  This is a much, much better product.  First, it's the right color for me.  Second, it definitely covers both my natural color and the silver strands.  Third, it lasts until I shampoo it out, which means I only have to use it twice a week.  I try to go about 3 or 4 weeks between color touch ups and the longer I wait, the better the results.  But my roots start to peek out the second week, so I need a cover up for about two solid weeks every month.  Rita Hazan makes a much better product and the spray is much quicker to use.  The powder blends in seamlessly so no one can tell that my roots are once again making an appearance.  I have thrown away what remained of Color Wow and have made Rita Hazan my go-to root concealer.  It does everything it's supposed to do and is less expensive than Color Wow.  But if you insist on using Color Wow, I urge you to purchase a regular eye shadow instead.  Not only will you get the same exact results, you will get a much better color match and save yourself a considerable sum in the process.  Even a drugstore eye shadow is better than Color Wow (I know, I've tried it).  But spray some hairspray first, otherwise the powder won't stick.  A large fluffy eye shadow brush is the best applicator.  However, if you really want a convenient way to cover gray then get Rita Hazan's spray.  It works like a charm.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27EYGCQH9MR8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYSZDQ4#wasThisHelpful","R27EYGCQH9MR8K","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this spray in the hopes of adding some body and volume to my medium textured hair.  I wanted some thickness and that tousled, sexy, bedhead look that's so on trend right now.  I read in a magazine article that if you use a curling iron to create loose waves, that layering a styling spray and a thickening spray is the best way to get a more voluminous look.  I used Living Proof No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray and then added a generous amount of Thick.  I then let my hair air dry overnight and in the morning used a 1.25 inch curling iron to create loose waves that I then loosened with my fingers.  Thick definitely added heft and gave me more thickness and also amped up the texture, giving me the desired Victoria's Secret waves.  My hair is cut in a layered lob and Thick definitely helped define the layers and gave me more volume.  Thick didn't leave my hair stiff or sticky and the waves held well all day.  I think it added just that bit of oomph that I needed to get the tousled, beachy look I was aiming for.  The sprayer did stick a bit and it was somewhat difficult to unclog it, but once I did, I guess I sprayed the perfect amount because I had a really great hair day that day.  I haven't tried using it on my roots and I'm a total klutz with a blow dryer and round brush, but I suppose that I would have gotten even more volume had I use a dryer.  Thick even smells pretty nice, which is a big plus in my book.  I think this spray would work really well for really fine hair and would not be overly stiff.  It does dull the shine a bit, but this is easily remedied with a shine spray.  I will have to see whether my style lasts for a couple of days, which would be really awesome.  So far, I think Thick does what it promises, amplifying body and texture and adding more thickness to each strand.  There are really great positive reviews of this product, which is why I decided to try it.  I bought it at Ulta, where I could have returned it if it didn't perform the way I'd hoped.  However, it did do exactly what it was supposed to, so I'm definitely going to keep using it.  The trick for me is layering it with a styling spray which gave me the hold I needed because my hair is extremely resistant and the waves will fall out if I don't use something with a significant amount of hold.  Using the two product together seems the perfect combination.  So the article in the magazine was right, layering is the way to use this spray if you need hold.  All in all, I'm pleased with my purchase and with Thick so far.  I definitely recommend it for people with my hair type as well as for finer hair.  I'm giving it four stars because I haven't yet tried using it alone, which may or may not be better than layering it with a styling spray.  However, I'm concerned that I may not get the amount of hold necessary for my waves to last all day.  I will try it by itself and if the results are good, I'll update this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29AHKZKHQOLM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007CXYMW#wasThisHelpful","R29AHKZKHQOLM6","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is not as light as Wen.  It sort of weighed my hair down and I also didn't feel that it rinsed out cleanly.  I bought this at Target and ended up returning it.  The lavender fragrance is very strong and it irritated my scalp somewhat (although the stinging subsided once I rinsed it).  I know this product is supposed to compete with Wen but it's very different and no match for it at all.  My hair didn't feel clean and felt heavy and didn't have much body at all.  If you're looking for a cleansing conditioner that's really light, like Wen Sweet Almond Mint, try VO5 Kiwi Lime conditioner, which I think is awesome as a cowash.  You can find it at Kmart for $2 and sometimes even at the Dollar Store.  It smells amazing and because it's so cheap, you can use a generous amount, which is the only way a cowash works well.  Leave it on for at least 10 minutes and then rinse well.  A cowash only works well when you use a significant amount of conditioner and you must leave it on for many minutes for it to work the best.  I found this out through trial and error with Wen.  When I first started using it I didn't use enough and my hair never felt clean.  I then discovered the secret through a post on a hair forum that said you have to be very generous, otherwise it doesn't work well.  Once I did this, the difference was like night and day.  I do love Wen but it's so expensive and I discovered VO5 through the same hair forum and have used it ever since with great results.  I cowash a couple of time a month (mainly because I missed the lather of regular shampoo, although I only use sulfate free formulas now) and my hair always looks great and behaves the way I want it to.  After rinsing, I use Agadir Argan Oil Treatment serum to eliminate frizz and provide thermal protection.  It works better than Moroccan Oil for a fraction of the price (on Amazon).  I then apply my usual styling products and my hair looks and feels great.  It has bounce, shine and body and my waves stay in place all day.  This regimen has saved my hair, which has never looked better. VO5 is a great beauty cheapie that packs a huge punch.  It's affordable for everyone.  But if your hair is dry, there are other VO5 formulas you may like better.  Check out naturallycurly.com for recommendations of cleansing conditioners for every hair type.  My hair is normal with dry ends and Kiwi Lime works great for me.  I much prefer it over this Renpure cowash and I've had no scalp issues with VO5.  If you want a comparable product to Wen, then VO5 is the way to go.  And anyone can afford it and everyone will have the beautiful hair to show for it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J4RMKQ4TLLQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYAGR9A#wasThisHelpful","R3J4RMKQ4TLLQC","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this brush at Sally's for the sole purpose of brushing out the residue from dry shampoo.  It works really well for this purpose and it's very soft so it doesn't stretch or break my hair.  The residue from dry shampoo clings to the bristles and is easily brushed out with this model of brush (plastic bristles don't work for this maneuver).  However, my hair is medium in thickness and because this brush is super soft, it doesn't really get through all of my hair.  It does work for distributing the natural oils from the root to the ends and it doesn't cause any damage.  But for brushing through my curls, I prefer a plastic vent brush with just a few bristles because this boar bristle brush would wreck my waves, stretching them out and keeping them from being well defined.  The best purpose for this boar bristle brush is to eliminate the residue from dry shampoo.  However, I do have to wash the brush regularly otherwise the white powder builds up on the bristles and if it's not relatively clean, it will put residue in rather than taking it out, lol!  Still, this is an excellent brush for the price.  If I could actually use the brush another way, I would have given it five stars rather than four.  But for less than $5, you can't beat it if you're a regular dry shampoo user.  If you are, you've likely discovered that plastic bristles are no help in brushing out the white residue.  You have to use a boar bristle brush if you want to get every last speck of powder out of the hair so that you don't end up with a grayish cast.  This brush is great for this.  I definitely recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G358T1GQ6ZLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00425ECYY#wasThisHelpful","R1G358T1GQ6ZLL","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this brush quite a lot.  It distributes the natural oils from my roots to the ends and it also gives my hair a nice sheen.  The mixture of nylon and boar bristles means that it also gets through tangles and snarls without breaking my hair.  The nylon bristles also give my scalp a massage.  I like everything about this brush.  I bought it at Sally's on sale for $7 and it's definitely worth much more.  I can't afford a Mason Pearson mixed bristle brush so this is the next best thing and is great for the price.  I use this brush to brush out the residue from dry shampoo and it works really well for that purpose.  It definitely gets the white powder out (plastic bristles don't work for this maneuver) and doesn't break my hair in the process.  This is a really gentle brush and the cushion means that it's very comfortable to use.  I don't know if it would be suitable for really thick hair though.  Mine's medium thickness and it works just fine for me.  The bristles are also long so they get through the whole thickness of my hair without pulling.  My hair is much shinier since I started using this brush.  However, it should only be used on dry hair because wet hair is very fragile and it would be too strong and would likely stretch and break the hair.  I like the large head because it covers a large surface area.  I think this brush would also work if you wanted to blow dry your hair straight because it does hold on really well and if you aimed the dryer right at the brush, it would definitely give a smoothing effect.  All in all, I really like this brush and think it's a great one for the price point.  I have other mixed bristle brushes but they have shorter bristles and don't get through my hair as well as this one.  If you want to distribute the natural oils down to the ends, you can't do better than this brush.  I definitely recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X45HE07W4028/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYMF8R6#wasThisHelpful","R1X45HE07W4028","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always gotten along fine with my wide tooth comb.  When my hair is wet it's very vulnerable and so I've always used a wide tooth comb, taking care to detangle my hair very gently and working my way up from the bottom, rather than combing from the top down.  My conditioner does a great job of detangling my strands so I really don't have to put much effort into combing them through.  However, the Tangle Teezer has been the talk of the hair forums for some time now so the last time I was in Sally's I decided to purchase one.  I thought it would perform better than my wide toothed comb but it really doesn't.  My hair doesn't seem to be in any better shape than it is when I use my old stand-by.  Yes, it detangles easily and I suppose it would be beneficial for those whose hair gets super tangled.  But I was always told by my stylists not to brush wet hair because that is when hair is at its most vulnerable.  So I don't see much difference between the Tangle Teezer and a regular plastic bristle brush.  I also notice that more hair appears in the Tangle Teezer than is trapped in my comb.  Whether this is because the Tangle Teezer is more rough, I have no idea, it's simply a fact.  So I think the Tangle Teezer will remain in my comb/brush basket and won't be used very much at all.  It feels like I'm pulling my hair out when I use it, so I think I'll either pitch it or give it to someone.  As far as I'm concerned it was a complete waste of money.  This is just a gimmick and is not as good as a wide toothed comb and at least for me, feels much more damaging and rough.  So I'll pass.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R9474H4CGSZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HJRLXK#wasThisHelpful","R3R9474H4CGSZM","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this 1.3 ounce dry shampoo powder on clearance at Ulta for $10.  I really prefer the powdered dry shampoos over the sprays because the sprays are messy and always leave my dark blond hair with a grayish cast no matter how hard I try to brush the residue out.  Also, most of the weight of the sprays is propellant and I'm sure they contain very little actual powder so this 1.3 ounce sprinkle on product lasts a lot longer than you might think at first glance.  I apply this powder to my oily roots in 1/2 partings from ear to ear.  I then sprinkle a little of the powder onto my fingertips and work it into the back. I put on my makeup for the day, which takes about 15-20 minutes, during which time the oil is absorbed.  I brush whatever residue remains (usually not much) out with a 100% boar bristle brush (plastic bristles don't work for this maneuver).  My hair looks much cleaner and feels fresher and has a nice amount of volume.  I've also used a bit more of this powder at night when my hair is extra oily and in the morning, almost no powder residue remains and if there is some, it's easily brushed out.  It works well both ways.  I also happen to really like the mango scent because I want my hair to not only look like I've washed it, I prefer that it smell that way too.  I've had this powder for several months and I use it several times a week and I still have half the container left, so it lasts a lot longer than you might think.  I also like the Alterna Talc Free dry shampoo powder in the purple bottle, which in contrast is very, very lightly scented and works just as well as this Alterna Bamboo product.  These Alterna products leave my hair soft and amenable to styling, not stiff or sticky at all.  I can still use a curling iron with good results on 2nd or 3rd day hair.  The only thing I don't like about dry shampoos is the matte finish so I use a shine spray on my finished style.  Other than this, I have no complaints.  I think this Mango dry shampoo powder works really well and it makes my hair feel as clean as possible without actually shampooing.  My hair is color treated so the less I shampoo the better my color looks and the longer it lasts and that makes me very happy.  The only question now is what to do with the spray dry shampoos I have left over? (Batiste, Not Your Mother's Clean Freak, Amika, R&Co, Beyond the Zone, Tresemme, Dove, AG).  I wasted a lot of $$ on these sprays, both drugstore and high end, and none of them delivered the results of the Alterna powders.  I guess my only choice is to recycle them, lol!  I certainly don't want to use them up because I can't leave the house with telltale gray roots.  Rather than making my hair look and feel clean, these sprays made it look tangled, matted and in desperate need of a wash, which is the complete opposite of the goal.  I'll stick with the powders from now on, thank you very much.  If you're looking for a really good dry shampoo product to use in lieu of the sprays, then this is a great one to try.  I definitely recommend this Alterna Mango dry shampoo powder as well as the Alterna powder in the purple bottle.  Both are really good and worth a try if you haven't had good results with the sprays.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9H3DKY9SNY9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BO5884K#wasThisHelpful","R9H3DKY9SNY9P","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this dry shampoo.  I really prefer the shake in powders over the sprays, which are messy and it's hard to control how much powder they disperse.  They also don't last very long and always leave a grayish cast in my dark blond hair no matter how much I try to brush the residue out.  With this one I can control the amount and as long as I wait 15-20 minutes for the oil to be absorbed, there's very little powder left over to brush out.  Plus it smells amazing and gives my hair that fresh scent like I just washed it.  While it's true that this container is tiny, there's more powder in it than you might think.  It has lasted me several months and I use it at least twice a week.  I also like the Alterna Talc Free dry shampoo powder that comes in the purple container.  It's a much larger size for not much more $$ (at least on Amazon) and it works just as well as the Bamboo, maybe a little better.  It also has a really nice fragrance and leaves my hair feeling clean and bouncy.  I will never go back to the messy spray dry shampoos.  These two Alterna products also give me a nice amount of volume that I can revive with a simple fluff of the fingers.  They give me that tousled, sexy bedhead look that's so on trend right now.  However, all dry shampoos leave a matte finish so I combat this by using a shine spray after I've finished brushing out the dry powder.  I hate products that dull the shine so this step is a necessity.  Otherwise, I'm really loving the loose dry shampoo powders made by Alterna.  I think they're a much better product than any of the spray dry shampoos I've tried.  There is simply no comparing the two.  If I need to use dry shampoo, I'll reach for one of these.  I definitely recommend them both.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QD3S4FA41B1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BO5PTLA#wasThisHelpful","R3QD3S4FA41B1H","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good dry shampoo and far superior to the spray formulas I've tried.  I had just about given up on dry shampoos altogether until I discovered some that were loose powders.  Sprays are very messy and it's hard to control the amount.  Moreover,  they always leave a grayish cast on my dark blond hair because I can never fully brush out the white residue.  I've tried Batiste, Not Your Mother's Clean Freak, Amika, R&Co and Beyond the Zone and none of them worked very well at all (although Amika was the best of the bunch but it's $25 so, uh...NO) .  Each time I used one of these products, I ended up wearing my hair in an updo and hoping that no one would notice the change in the color of my hair, lol!  Although I wasted a considerable amount of cash trying these sprays, I was in Sephora one day and saw the Bumble and Bumble Pret a Powder dry shampoo and decided to take the chance and give it a try.  And I absolutely love it!!  However, this is not a review for Pret a Powder so I'll get right to the point.  BB is really expensive and although the 2 ounce bottle lasts a lot longer than you might think, it's still a pricey product.  I was searching Amazon for alternatives, when I noticed this Alterna dry shampoo powder.  It's 2.65 ounces, so it's significantly bigger than BB and the Prime price was $14, so I had to order it and was hoping it was as good as BB.  I apply the Alterna powder in 1/2 inch sections from ear to ear and then I put some of the powder on my hands and do the back.  I then rub it in like regular shampoo and let it work for 15-20 minutes while I put on my makeup.  After waiting the required time, I brush out what little powder remains with a 100% boar bristle brush (plastic bristles don't work for this maneuver).  The powder absorbs the oil and no white residue is visible after I brush it out.  I also get a nice amount of volume.  Alterna also smells really nice (as do all their products) and makes my hair felt fluffy and clean.  I also like the fact that this product is talc free because not only am I sensitive to it, it's also a known carcinogen!!  This powder works so much better than the spray variety and I'm so glad I discovered an alternative.  Alterna doesn't work quite as well as BB but I'm willing to forego buying BB because Alterna is so attractively priced on Amazon Prime.  I bought 4 bottles of Alterna so I have a few backups in case the price goes up.  The Alterna powder is not quite as fine as BB so there's a little more residue to brush out, but this takes just a few minutes to do and is therefore no big deal.  Alterna also has a nicer fragrance (the scent of BB is virtually undetectable).  So I'm relatively satisfied with Alterna and will continue to use it as long as it's so fairly priced.  The bottle lasts a couple of months, even though I use it a couple of times a week.  I've tried the Alterna Caviar Moisture Replenishing shampoo and conditioner but they weren't anything special so I was a little hesitant to try this dry shampoo.  However, the reviews were really good so I decided to take the plunge.  I gave BB five stars but my budget doesn't always allow me to spend that much and so I'm making Alterna my go-to dry shampoo for the time being.  I'm glad I have several bottles in readiness and if you're smart, you'll search out the seller that has such a phenomenal price.  Ulta sells Alterna dry shampoo powder for $22 so there's a significant savings on Amazon.  I definitely recommend this product and you can't do better for the price.  Powdered dry shampoo beats the messy sprays hands down.  Try this product and you'll see what I mean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L7EUU0685QT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJSAEGI#wasThisHelpful","R1L7EUU0685QT0","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally bought this product to use as a root lifting spray but soon discovered that it's a styling product, not a finishing one.  So I had no idea what to do with it.  However, I recently saw an article in a fashion magazine that suggested layering a styling spray with a thickening spray for beachy waves.  My favorite styling spray is Living Proof No Frizz Weightless styling spray, so I used it as usual and then layered a small amount of Superstar on top.  I don't blowdry my hair but instead let it air dry overnight.  In the morning I used a curling iron to create loose waves.  I could definitely see that Supestar added some nice volume to my hair and did make it look a bit thicker and fuller.  I will have to experiment with the amount of both products to find the ultimate combination, but for now, I'm pleased with the results.  My waves did stay in place all day (with the addition of some flexible hold hairspray) and the two products did give me that beachy look.  The next time I use these products, I will use less of LP and a bit more of Superstar so see whether there's any noticeable difference.  Superstar did dry a bit stiff, but once I brushed through my hair, the stiffness was gone and it felt soft again.  I sometimes hate buying hair products on Amazon that I haven't tried because they can't be returned.  However, I did read the positive reviews before buying this spray and it sounded like something I had been looking for.  Although it isn't exactly the type of product I wanted (my search for a root spray goes on)  I can hopefully make it a good part of my regular routine.  But if it ends up not making a huge difference, then I guess I""ll have no choice but to pass it off to family and friends.  It would be a definitely waste of money in that case.  But so far, the results seem promising and I'll keep trying to get the combination of styling spray and thickening spray right.  Superstar does add heft so it would likely be great for fine hair.  And it's certainly not heavy at all so it won't weigh hair down.  I'm giving this product four stars, for now.  If I really get great results, I'll update this review.  As it stands now, I certainly recommend this product for thickening thin locks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PIC2PZGUNQCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EEHC5B2#wasThisHelpful","R2PIC2PZGUNQCP","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these boots!!  I've been looking for a low heeled bootie that can be worn either casually, with denim, or with sleeker leggings and trousers and this style definitely fits the bill.  I can wear them all day without any issues and the leather and suede let my feet breathe.  I love the somewhat rocker chick vibe that the straps give this bootie, which toughens them up without crossing the line into the biker look.  They are sleek and very chic and I will enjoy wearing them everywhere and with all kinds of outfits.  I probably won't wear them with skirts because the heel is really low and I'm not sure that the proportion would work.  However, this bootie goes with all my jeans and they're even suitable to wear with sleek and skinny black pants/trousers and even my leather leggings.  The toe is comfortably rounded and will be in style for a long time to come.  The leather and suede and are top quality and the booties have a nice sheen.  I'm surprised that I found this pair for such a reasonable price.  They were in my budget but look much more expensive.  Thanks Amazon!  I ordered my usual size and they fit perfectly, in both length and width.  There is moderate arch support which means they are comfortable to wear for long periods.  I've been searching for just this style for some time and am so glad I decided to check Amazon.  They are exactly what I wanted.  I highly recommend these booties for all the reasons I've stated.  The leather/suede is really nice and the fit is great.

"This is the same company that makes the Harry Josh Pro dryer that's $350.  This is a great hair dryer that dries my hair quickly with no frizz whatsoever.  It's light, quiet and ionic, which makes a huge difference.  I don't normally do the round brush and dryer thing, I'm too uncoordinated.  But at night, I dry my hair about 80% and then let it air dry the rest of the way.  My hair is medium thick and this dryer does the job in just a few minutes, saving me at least half the time of my cheap Conair dryer.  In the morning, I do use a round brush to shape my bangs and this dryer and the brush give me tons of volume that lasts all day.  I also use fewer frizz fighting products since I've gotten this dryer.  I'm not thrilled at the outrageous shipping charges but Amazon saved me at least $50 over other online sites.  This is the first high end dryer I've owned and I'm really happy with the quality.  It seems solid and its performance has been amazing thus far.  Even if I don't do a traditional blowout, this dryer prevents the frizz that the Florida humidity seems intent on delivering if I don't use it.  I thought about buying a Sedu but decided against it because the reviews for this dryer were just as good and why spend the extra money if I'm not going to get better benefits?  I would never buy this dryer just because Harry Josh's name is on it (who is he anyway?) and I'm so glad I did some research before deciding to purchase this Velectra model.  It's everything I'd hoped it would be and more.  There's definitely a tangible difference between cheap dryers and this one.  It was worth every extra dollar as far as I'm concerned.  If you want a great hair dryer that works like magic to calm frizz, is quiet, and lightweight, then look no further.  I'm pleased with my purchase and hope that the relatively unknown name will soon be more prominent.  The quality is excellent and the good results I've gotten were not possible with my drugstore dryer.  I definitely recommend this hair dryer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25U6I9X8NDSBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B0PQQVG#wasThisHelpful","R25U6I9X8NDSBW","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is just so-so.  It's really nothing special.  It doesn't absorb excess oil very well when used on 2nd day hair that has some oiliness at the roots.  I sprinkled some of this powder on my roots from ear to ear in 1/2 inch partings, avoiding my actual part.  I then rubbed it in well (like actual shampoo) and let it sit for 15-20 minutes while I put on my makeup.  I then used a 100% boar bristle brush (plastic bristles don't work for this maneuver) to remove what powder remained.  I didn't get much volume, despite the fact that I used what I thought was a generous amount of product.  It didn't really absorbed the oil very well at all and I was disappointed overall.  I have since found a superior dry shampoo powder, Bumble and Bumble Pret a Powder, that does absorb oil and makes my hair look much cleaner.  It also adds considerably more volume that lasts all day and can be revived with a fluff of the fingers.  Pret a Powder also has a very subtle scent that doesn't interfere with my perfume.  Yes, it's expensive.  However, looks can be deceiving because it takes very little powder to do the job so the bottle lasts a lot longer than it may appear at first glance.  I use it about twice a week and although I've had it for several months, I still have half the bottle left.  But who wants to pay even a small price for an inferior product?  It's money wasted!  I'd rather fork out the cash for a product that does what it promises, so I'll definitely be purchasing Pret a Powder from now on.  I wasted $10 on this Sexy Hair product and I have no idea what to do with what powder remains in the bottle.  I supposed I could try it on clean hair because it certainly doesn't work on dirty hair.  I have a hall closet full of hair product FAILS and I've put Powder Play right there on the shelf with all the others.  I'd much rather pay Sephora for Pret a Powder and use a product that makes my hair look refreshed and volumized than try to slide by on the cheap with something that doesn't deliver the proper results.  And I can't stand spray dry shampoos.  I find them messy and they always leave my dark blond hair with a grayish cast that I can never fully brush out.  The light tinted formulas are just as bad and leave behind a yellow tone.  So I much prefer a powder dry shampoo where I can control the amount.  I've also have pretty good results with Oscar Blandi Pronto and Alterna's powder dry shampoo, both of which I gave four stars.  But if you really want a 5 star product, go with Bumble and Bumble.  I definitely don't recommend Powder Play for anyone who wants the benefits of a true dry shampoo.  It simply doesn't absorb the oil and leaves my hair feeling matted and dirtier than when I started.

It also a bigger size for less money than Oscar Blandi Pronto dry shampoo powder, Bumble and Bumble Pret a Powder and Osis Dust It.

My hair  then looks much cleaner and it smells fresh and has some nice volume to boot.  I've also used it at night when my hair is quite oily and in the morning, the powder has pretty much disappeared and so has the oil. My hair is color treated so washing it too often fades the color and I certainly don't want that to happen, hence the dry shampoo.  I also love Pret a Powder by Bumble and Bumble (I gave it five stars) which is also a dry shampoo powder.  However, there are 2.65 ounces in this Alterna container for $14 (on Amazon) versus 2 ounces in the BB bottle for $29.  So there's no comparison as far as pricing goes.  I'm willing to make a four star product a regular part of my routine because I can get two bottles of Alterna for less than one of BB. So I think you see my point.  In any case, the Alterna product works well and I'm satisfied enough with the results to purchase it instead of BB.  I've also used Oscar Blandi Pronto powder, which works well too and is $22 for a little more than 2 ounces.  So from a dollar standpoint, you can't beat Amazon's price for Alterna so I'll be sticking with it for the foreseeable future.  I've already purchased 4 bottle of Alterna, 3 to have as backups just in case the price goes up.  And the Alterna bottle (and the BB and Pronto) lasts longer than you might think.  It takes very little product to do the job and I like the fact that I can easily control the amount of powder, something that's not really possible with spray dry shampoos, which I find very messy and they always leave my hair dark blond hair with a grayish cast.  I can't imagine that any of them would work for those with medium to dark hair.  This Alterna powder is absorbed pretty quickly and leaves very little residue and what little powder remains is easily brushed out. Alterna also has very little fragrance, which I find somewhat disappointing.  I would prefer it if my hair smelled really fresh and clean, like I just shampooed.  But I guess you can't have everything, lol! (Pret a Powder has very little scent as well.)  All in all, this is a good product and far superior to any spray dry shampoo I've tried (Not Your Mother's Clean Freak, Amika , R&Co, Fructis Volume Extend, Batiste, Beyond the Zone).  It's also superior to some other powder dry shampoos, namely, Beyond the Zone Volumizing Powder and Osis Dust It.

"If you have a greenish tinge to your hair as a result of chlorine buildup, this is the perfect shampoo to use to get rid of it.  Chlorine is very damaging to hair and can certainly weaken its structure significantly.  You'll need the chelating effects of this shampoo in order to compensate for the damaging effects of chlorine.  If you swim regularly, you should always wear a swim cap but even if you do this, you might get your hair wet anyway and you could get the horrible greenish tinge, known as ""swimmer's hair"".  Regular use of this shampoo will keep your hair from changing color.  However, I've found this shampoo somewhat drying when used regularly so be sure you're using a very moisturizing conditioner and that you're using a very hydrating mask every week with heat for about 45 minutes or so.  This shampoo is not suitable for color treated hair because it will definitely fade the color.  For those with colored hair, this is a dilemma:  dyed hair is more susceptible to the off tones created by chlorine but this shampoo is very strong and can definitely fade the color.  The best solution is to wear a swim cap and use this shampoo sparingly, perhaps every third or fourth shampoo.  And you can plan on doing the color more frequently to compensate for the fading.  I also really like Malibu's swimmer's shampoo and treatment, which I find a bit gentler than Ion, just fyi.  However, if you have virgin hair and are plagued by the inevitable greenish chlorine tinge, this is a great product to use.  I definitely recommend it, just be sure you're regularly hydrating your hair well with a nourishing conditioner and mask.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFZ94HA70Y0MO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KPGFOW#wasThisHelpful","RFZ94HA70Y0MO","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have very, very sensitive skin so trying to find a sunscreen has been something of a battle.  I use the La Roche-Posay Toleraine moisturizers (the Ultra formula for around my eyes) and the Murad Sensitive Skin Serum but needed something that protects me from the harsh Florida sunshine.  I bought this sunscreen serum at Ulta, hoping that it would be suitable for my highly reactive skin type.  My skin is also somewhat oily so I was looking for something that would soak in well without leaving my skin greasy.  I also needed something that could be used under makeup.  This sunscreen serum is a tad bit greasy and it does take quite a few minutes to completely soak in.  However, it causes no reaction and seems to be fine under makeup as long as I use a mattifying primer (Lorac Porefection).  It only takes two pumps to cover my face and neck, which means this product will last quite some time.  I'm giving it four stars instead of five because I seriously doubt I'll be able to use it during the summer months because it'll simply be too hydrating for me.  If you have drier skin, this may be the perfect formula for you.  As it is now (in the fall of 2015) this sunscreen serum seems to be serving its purpose well enough for me to keep using it.  I do blot my face before applying my foundation because the sunscreen does leave a rather oily finish, even once it has soaked in for 10-15 minutes.  In the summer months, I plan on using Obagi Matte SPF 50 sunscreen which truly is matte can be used well under foundation.  This LRP sunscreen would be an excellent choice for those with dry skin but in the winter months, it'll work well enough for me to justify keeping it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LNTY9TFWNV4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBJWR0M#wasThisHelpful","R1LNTY9TFWNV4K","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bootie is exactly what I was looking for.  They will add some edge and a rock and roll twist to many different outfits.  The quality is excellent and I can't believe they were such a good buy on Amazon. The heel is the perfect height for all day wear and they don't bother my feet at all, even when I wear them for 12 hours at a stretch.  The leopard print is now considered to be a neutral and goes well with black or brown or even khaki.  I'll wear them with black pants (skinnies and trousers alike) as well as denim.  They're such a fun addition to my mostly neutral wardrobe.  I've been looking for a pair just like this for some time and I'm so gladly I finally took the plunge and bought this SE pair.  The quality is excellent and the leather will stand up for years to come. I highly recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27KZYPSS5QDYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004I5D2PI#wasThisHelpful","R27KZYPSS5QDYK","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this blush at Sephora and use it daily.  I love the way it goes on so smoothly and blends so easily.  I use a compact blush brush to apply it because it's easier  and then I blend it with the sides of the brush.  This gives me a much smoother finish than using my fingers.  I barely touch the brush to the product because the gelee is so concentrated and it only takes the tiniest amount to get a nice flush of coverage.  This blush also lasts all day, even though I have oily skin.  It barely fades after 8-10 hours and I've found no need to reapply it during the day.  I love products that I can apply once and I'm done for the duration.  This color mimics a natural flush and it gives my neutral complexion some much needed rosiness.  Blush is the one makeup item I simply can't live without because it makes such a huge difference.  I'm thinking about trying the berry shade now that the fall weather is approaching and makeup colors are getting darker and more intense.  I do use foundation and this blush glides right over it without dragging or getting splotchy.  It's simply a superb product and worth every penny.  I think this small container of blush will last me several years.  I've been using it for 6 months and have barely made a dent in it.  It has supplanted all my powder blushes because the clear, rosy color makes me look healthy and like I've just run 5 miles.  This color is a sheer pink wash that would be universally flattering.  It's far superior to other cheek stains I've tried (like Benetint) and much, much easier to apply.  I highly recommend this blush and this color.  It would work for anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22N2RSU5VQ48P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z8RJM0O#wasThisHelpful","R22N2RSU5VQ48P","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this dress!! I've wanted a DVF wrap dress for a long time and I finally settled on this animal print wonder.  It has black, white and a beautiful tobacco brown, a combination that I can wear with a lot of different accessories.  The fit is typical of fit and flare styles, with the skirt having a definite A line.  This style is very flattering for most shapes and helps to define my waist, while simultaneously accenting my cleavage.  If I want to be a little more modest, I can add a cami underneath.  I took my regular size and it fit perfectly and doesn't even need a tiny bit of tailoring.  The hemline hits right above the knee, which is the perfect flattering length for most women.  The fabric is really nice and is a medium weight jersey that doesn't wrinkle.  It will be great when I travel and need something that can stand up to suitcase living.  Right now, it's autumn and I'm planning on wearing the dress with black booties, which I will exchange for tights and tall boots once winter sets in.  I'm thrilled that Amazon had this print, which I searched several other DVF sites for and couldn't find.  This is the perfect cool weather dress.  I find dresses easier to wear than pants because all I have to do is throw one on, add some jewelry and I'm done!!  I plan on buying several other DVF wraps including a solid black one, which can be dressed up with statement jewelry and sky high heels or dressed down with flats.  I highly recommend this cool print and DVF dresses in general.  You can definitely tell that this designer knows what's flattering.  This dress is a classic style but still modern and impossibly cool.  I will enjoy wearing it very much.  I saved about $150 buying it on Amazon.  Yipee!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16RCV4TM2F4L0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOWJ68I#wasThisHelpful","R16RCV4TM2F4L0","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great dress!!  It gives my straight up and down frame a nice hourglass silhouette and is perfect for work or play.  It can be dressed up with red or black (or any other color) statement jewelry and sky high heels or it can be worn with flats, booties or with tall boots.  I love pairing it with red heels, which is a classic combination.  I absolutely love animal prints and this one is perfect.  The fabrication is excellent and it skims the body easily and doesn't show every bump or bulge.  I own several wrap dress copies, but nothing takes the place of an original DVF.  The woman definitely knows how to dress women and what is flattering on almost every body type.  The invention of the wrap dress was a definite coup in women's fashion and I'm so glad I finally own the real thing.  I tried to find a similar print on the Saks website but didn't so I'm glad that Amazon had one that worked for me.  This dress has a double wrap, which cinches in the waist a bit more than the original single wrap design, which is great for someone with a figure like mine.  The deep V can show significant cleavage or the dress can be worn with a camisole underneath for a more modest look.  I ordered my regular size and it fits perfectly and the hemline hits me just above the knee, which is the perfect length.  I don't even need to have the dress tailored in any way.  The sleeves hit just below the elbow which is great for gals my age who are a bit shy about baring their upper arms.  All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase and I save about $80 by ordering this dress from Amazon.  I'm so happy I finally own a real DVF wrap dress!!

"This is a great dress!!  DVF invented the wrap dress and despite the fact that I own several similar dresses, the fit of the original is much more flattering.  This dress is rayon so it skims the body easily and shows just a little cleavage, which is very sexy.  However, this dress is perfect for a work environment and the style is flattering for almost all body types.  DVF invented something timeless that has become a classic style.  They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  But the imitation wrap dresses I have do not fit like the original.  The Amazon price is about $100 less than other online retailers so I decided to take the chance and buy this dress.  I'm so glad I did.  It can be dressed up with sparkly statement jewelry and sky-high heels or dressed down with flats or tights and boots.  The hemline hits me just above the knee, which is perfect for my 5'7"" frame.  I ordered my regular size and it fits perfectly.  I decided to get this dress in basic black because I wanted something that was versatile yet chic and this dress definitely fits the bill.  I've been wanting an original DVF wrap dress for a long time and am so happy to finally own one. It puts all my copies to shame (I might never wear them again, lol!).  I've decided that I'm going to start collecting this style in some of the signature DVF prints, perhaps something black and white or black and red to start with.  Although I don't really have a waistline, this dress gives me the illusion of an hourglass shape and I couldn't be more thrilled with the effects.  All in all, I'm truly ecstatic about my purchase and will look forward to buying another DVF wrap dress soon.  I definitely recommend this style and the DVF brand in general.  The quality is top notch and the fabrication is amazing.

"If you have light blond hair, you may like this dry shampoo a lot.  If, like me, you're hair is a dark, neutral blond or even medium blond, it's just as noticeable as the white dry shampoos.  Batiste works better than other drugstore spray dry shampoos and if you're especially organized and think ahead, it works best if you spray it on at night and then brush out the residue in the morning.  But if you only have 15-20 minutes, this is not the formula for you.  It does smell rather nice and adds a bit of volume at the roots, but it's just as messy as other spray dry shampoos and that's not what I want.  I've found a dry shampoo that works in a short amount of time, smells fresh and adds a lot of volume:  Bumble and Bumble Pret a Powder.  It's a powder that you sprinkle on the roots (it's easy to control the amount) every 1/2 inch or so.  It absorbs oil while I put on my makeup and what little residue remains is easily brushed out with a 100% boar bristle brush (plastic bristles don't work for this maneuver).  It gives lasting volume and can be used two days in a row without buildup or leaving my hair feeling matted and dirty.  My hair is color treated so I try to shampoo as little as I can and with Pret a Powder, I can skip shampooing for two additional days.  The first day I use it I wear my hair down and it gives me that tousled, sexy bedhead look that's so on trend right now.  The second day I use it, I wear my hair in an updo and it adds a nice amount of grip that makes the updo possible (usually a french twist or a chignon).  Yes, BB is expensive.  However, the 2 ounce size is deceptive.  First, it doesn't contain propellant, which is a significant portion of spray dry shampoo.  Second, it doesn't take much powder to do the job.  I use it twice a week and the bottle is still half full and I purchased it a couple of months ago.  So it's more economical than you might think at first glance.  Of course, buying an inferior product at the drugstore, one you don't like and probably won't use up, is a waste of money.  Wouldn't you want something that meets or exceeds your expectations and wouldn't you be willing to pay a little more for it, rather than wasting $8-$10 on products that don't do what you want?  I would.  If you purchase BB from Sephora, you can always return it if you don't like it.  If you have darker blond hair, this Batiste product won't work any better for you than it has for me.  It leaves a strange residue that's not exactly gray but is a very light yellow.  Yuck!!  I want my hair to look like the color it actually is, not like a wig, lol!  Pret a Powder does everything a dry shampoo is supposed to do so I don't mind paying more for it.  I've tried several drugstore spray dry shampoos (Fructis Volume Extend, Not Your Mother's Clean Freak, Loreal, Dove, Psssst) and not one of them worked well for me (although Clean Freak was the least bad).  Think of all the money I wasted!!  I used each one a couple of times and then ended up throwing the rest away.  I looked at the reviews for each of these products and I think those people who gave  them positive feedback have very low expectations, lol!  Pret a Powder is far superior to any of these sprays and it will be my go-to dry shampoo, even if I have to carefully budget to buy it.  Sometimes high end is simply better and that's true in this case.  If you're a very light blond, then this Batiste dry shampoo will likely give you a pretty good result if you use it overnight.  But if you're blond hair is in the medium to dark range, you'll absolutely hate it.  My suggestion is to save your pennies and try Pret a Powder.  You won't be sorry.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q1PVOFUVF09X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081RZ2X4#wasThisHelpful","R1Q1PVOFUVF09X","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This wax pencil is indispensable to me.  My wayward brow hairs have a mind of their own and refuse to lay flat in a nice line.  I've tried brow gels but they don't have enough hold and they wear off during the day (somehow my brow hairs migrate out of line within a few hours, lol!).  But I've found a routine that works for me and lasts until I take off my makeup at night.  I use Brow Fix generously all over my brows and then I comb the hairs into the desired shape with a spoolie.  I then use the Anastasia brow powder duo in Taupe to fill in and give my brows a nice polished appearance.  The wax doesn't interfere with the powder at all and it goes on very smoothly with a stiff angled brush.  My brows hold their shape through the application of the powder and when I've finished filling in, I go over them again with the spoolie.  If there are some wayward hairs, I simply reapply a little more Brow Fix and that tames them into submission.  I live in Florida, where the humidity can reach ungodly levels but Brow Fix stays put no matter what the weather.  It also makes the powder last all day without smearing, despite the fact that sweating is inevitable.  The only downside to Brow Fix is that it has to be sharpened, which definitely wastes product.  However, if you put it in the freezer for several hours before sharpening, much less product is wasted and you'll get a sharper point.  I don't mind spending more for this wax pencil because I know it works well and is strong enough to tame even the most unruly brows.  You can apply a little bit or a lot and you'll still be able to use powder to fill in your brows (if that's in fact what you want).  The wax is somewhat soft, and is invisible and gives significant hold that stands up to any kind of weather.  I really love this product and can't be without it.  I recommend it to anyone who has brows that need to be tamed once and for all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RBBUO6EIKD6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GI2477Q#wasThisHelpful","R3RBBUO6EIKD6T","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This texture spray is available at Target for $10 so don't pay an inflated Amazon seller's ridiculous price!!  It's a decent product and does what it claims to do.  Most dry texture sprays have a matte finish but this one adds shine, which is something I really like.  I have a layered long bob (a lob, lol!) and I've been trying to find something that would define the layers while adding subtle volume at the crown.  This spray definitely does exactly what I've been looking for.  It also adds light, brushable hold that lasts all day.  I've tried AG High and Dry, Fructis Texture Tease, Redken Wind Blown and Beyond the Zone Vamped Up, none of which do exactly what I want.  And they all give my hair a matte finish, which I definitely don't like.  When my hair is clean, it doesn't have the volume it does when it's a little dirtier so I've been using a texture spray to dirty it up a bit and to hopefully get that sexy, bedhead, tousled look that's so popular right now.  These sprays give me varying degrees of bedhead and are good for updos, but a couple of them build up so badly that I can't get a brush through my hair the next day while others are so light that they make no difference at all.  This Umberto spray is different from all of them and  I can definitely use it a couple of days in a row and it also builds volume, all the while adding a nice sheen.  I prefer it to any of the other sprays I've tried.  I think it's definitely worth the $10 price tag and I'm sure you can order it from Target.com so you don't have to pay the exorbitant Amazon price.  It's a really good product and it gives my hair the exact look I'm going for.  It separates the layers, giving them piecey definition and adds volume when sprayed at the roots.  I couldn't ask for more.  It also smells nice, which is a huge plus.  I really like the fact that I can use it several days in a row without making my hair a tangled mess.  And it washes out with no sticky residue.  Who could ask for more?  I'm pleased with my purchase and will make this spray a regular part of my routine.  I recommend it for anyone with a layered cut who is looking for separation, definition and shine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16F6PW77EX9U2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016O9LX9W#wasThisHelpful","R16F6PW77EX9U2","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful pair of boots.  I've been wanting a pair of over the knee boots for some times and finally found this pair when I was out shopping over the weekend.  The leather is gorgeous and soft and there's a wonderful sheen to it that only expensive leather has.  The boots hit me in the perfect spot and they are so soft and luxurious.  They are also very comfortable and I can wear them all day, even when walking a considerable amount, and they don't pinch or negatively affect my tootsies in any way.  I ordered my regular size and they fit perfectly, including the width (I'm a medium).  They are a little difficult to get on at first, until I practiced a few times.  This is my first pair of Stuart Weitzman boots and I'm hoping they last a very long time.  Yes, they were expensive.  But the quality is beyond compare and they are so comfortable that I feel I got somewhat of a bargain.  I've been lusting after these boots for a while and finally bit the bullet and bought them and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

"I like this top coat and have had no issues with the thickness or stringiness other reviewers have noted.  It goes on like a regular top coat but does take an extra few minutes to dry.  My mani typically lasts about a week with a few small chips toward the end.  This top coat has a lot of shine that didn't dull much and it lasted about as long as my regular Seche Vita without a chip.  I wanted to like it more than my regular product because I really like Essie polish but it performed about the same.  So far, the Sally Hansen Gel polishes (with their specific top coat) have lasted the longest for me.  However, I will use up Gel Setter but likely won't buy it again.  I'm pretty happy with Seche Vita and it dries very quickly, which is a good thing because I'm notorious for messing up my mani before it's dry (I'm impatient, lol!).  I even used Gel Setter with an Essie polish just so I could be sure to get the optimum performance from the top coat.  I'm giving this product four stars because I did have a few small chips after four days or so and typically I go about 5 or 6 days with Seche Vita provided I'm not doing many dishes or intensive house cleaning.  I do recommend this top coat but if you're looking for a long lasting gel polish that can be removed easily, go with Sally Hansen instead.  The only reason why I don't use SH exclusively is the limited range of available colors.  But when I want a long lasting polish and I'm in the mood for red or black, I go with SH.  I can go ten days without a chip when I use it, although I do apply the SH topcoat every few days because the shine dulls a bit over time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23LK3PQCYR4G0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XU7WLKC#wasThisHelpful","R23LK3PQCYR4G0","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This midi dress is exactly what I was looking for.  The fabric is flannel suiting material which will hold up well over time.  I live in Florida and because this dress is lightweight wool, it will be perfect for the winter months here in the south.  The style is very flattering, giving me the illusion of a waist and the fabric skims lightly over my hips.  The length is perfect also, hitting me just below the knee.  The skirt of the dress is rather flowy and has movement, which I love.  I wear a size 8 and that's what I ordered and it fit me perfectly.  Yes, Theory is expensive.  However,the quality is second to none and is on par with luxury brands in my opinion.  I have many Theory items that I've had for many years that still look new and I still wear them all the time.  I buy classic Theory styles that I'll be able to wear for the foreseeable future so the return on my investment is huge.  Theory also has a high resale value.  This dress can be dressed up or down depending on the accessories.  It's equally great with a high chunky heel or tall boots, even booties.  There are so many ways to accessorize it and the style would be flattering on any body type.  Theory is definitely worth the high price tag but Amazon has some great prices so I'll be sure to keep my eyes open.  All in all, I'm pleased with my purchase and will look forward to wearing this dress many times throughout the colder months.

"I ordered this dress from the Nordstrom website but was surprised to find it here on Amazon as well.  I love the classic style of this dress, which will always be in style.  The fabric is a wool blend that has a bit of stretch and the color is a deep black.  I ordered my regular size (8) and it fits perfectly.  The silhouette is very flattering, giving me the illusion of a waistline.  I think this fit and flare style would be universally flattering though.  I have worn Theory for many years and still have numerous classic pieces that still look brand new.  I consider my personal style to be classic and I don't really invest in many trendy pieces so this dress is a really good addition to my wardrobe.  I will enjoy wearing it throughout the fall and winter months.  The length is perfect and it hits just above my knee.  The fabric floats gently over my curves without being too revealing so this style of dress is perfect for work.  Because it's such a simple style, it can be dressed up with heels and statement jewelry or dressed down and made a bit funky when worn with a scarf and booties.  Basic black can also be enhanced with a bright bag or other jewel toned accessories.  There are myriad ways to wear this flattering style of dress and I look forward to exploring them all.  Theory is at the top of my budget but I always get a great return on my investment.  As long as you have a good dry cleaner, Theory pieces will last a long time.  They also have a high resale value.  The quality is second to none and is on par with luxury brands in my opinion.  Yes, this dress is an investment, but it's super flattering on every body type and the fabric is gorgeous and rich.

"I bought this Theory jacket because I needed something that would dress up jeans and khakis.  I love the quality of Theory clothing and this stretch wool blazer is no exception.  I'm a size 8 and ordered the medium and it fits me perfectly.  It is slightly nipped in at the waist and therefore gives my stick straight frame the illusion of a waistline (which I love).

Right now, it's stylish to wear navy with black so I'll definitely wear this jacket with my black leather trousers and a cashmere sweater.  This jacket is a classic style that can be dressed up or down and is therefore very versatile.  I have worn Theory clothing for two decades and have always appreciated the quality of the fabric and the attention to detail.  I have many Theory pieces that I've had for a long time that still look brand new.  I will definitely wear this jacket a lot and I'm so glad I found exactly what I was looking for on Amazon.  This style is timeless and classic and will therefore always be chic and stylish.  I definitely recommend Theory as a brand and this style in particular.  It's definitely worth the price tag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WPAEN27JWL0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ES6E3M#wasThisHelpful","R1WPAEN27JWL0D","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleasantly surprised that I actually found a color match in this foundation.  Soft beige works great with my light neutral skin tone and is a perfect match.  I've tried so many drugstore foundations and have never found one that works, so for many years I've shelled out obscene amounts of money for high end products.  But this foundation has so many of the features of my favorite high end foundations and performs so well, that's it's hard for me to believe it's so inexpensive.  It goes on smoothly over primer (Lorac Porefection) and blends easily with my Real Techniques sponge.  It is also buildable so if you want more coverage, apply a thin layer and then repeat the process.  It covers any redness I have and gives me a nice glow, just like high end products.  I have very sensitive skin and I have to say that this Rimmel foundation causes no reaction at all and doesn't have a strong fragrance.  This foundation also has SPF 15, which isn't much, but at least it's something.  I set this foundation with loose powder (Urban Decay Naked or ELF HD powder) which keeps the shine away for several hours, although I do end up using a blotting paper or two during the day (I have to do this with every foundation).  I would say my skin is normal with some minor oiliness in the T zone.  This foundation also does not oxidize (turn darker or orange) like a lot of drugstore products.  All in all, I'm pleased with my purchase and am really shocked that this foundation is so inexpensive.  I haven't had any luck at all with any of the other drugstore foundations I've tried and had really given up and decided that I had no choice but to fork out big time cash for high end products.  Although I do like the high end foundation I'm using at the moment, I also really like this Rimmel foundation.  I find myself reaching for Rimmel more often  and if there were a blind test, I'm not sure I could tell the difference between the two.  I'm giving Rimmel four stars instead of five because I do have some oil breakthrough sooner than with the high end foundation, but that is the only difference and I can definitely live with that.  This foundation would work for anyone who has normal to dry skin but I don't think it's suitable for oily skin.  It has good coverage and imparts a nice glow.  I definitely recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L98GPNWTJM01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LXMLBI#wasThisHelpful","R2L98GPNWTJM01","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this foundation on a whim because I've tried nearly every other drugstore foundation out there and I thought, why not?  It was really cheap but the quality is much better than the price point implies.  And strangely enough, it does match my light, neutral skin tone really well.  I do use rather expensive foundation but I prefer to conserve it so if I'm just running to the grocery store or the dry cleaners, I'll use this Rimmel foundation instead.  But it goes on just as smoothly as high end products and it blends easily with a Real Techniques sponge.  I do use a primer (either Smashbox or Maybelline Baby Skin) so that may have something to do with it.  This foundation wears well for many hours before I have to blot my T zone but it doesn't oxidize (which makes foundation turn dark or orange) which is something that other drugstore foundations I tried have done.  This foundation is so inexpensive that it may make you wonder how it could perform on par with $50 products.  Well, good makeup products can be found at all price points, it's just the experimenting that gets expensive.  If you buy an expensive foundation from Sephora or Ulta, you can return it if you don't like it.  Drugstores don't have the same policy, so you're pretty much taking a chance with your money because if it doesn't work out, you can only pass it on to someone else, or pitch it in the trash.  And if you're really searching diligently, the cash can add up.  Most drugstore foundations are around $10 and if you try 5 that don't work out, there's your $50!!  But this Rimmel foundation not only matched my hard to match neutral skin tone, it also performed really well.  And this was very surprising.  I will keep this product in my foundation arsenal because it works.  And I should mention that my skin is super sensitive, especially to fragrance, but I had no reaction at all with this foundation.  My skin type is normal with some oiliness in my T zone and this foundation lasted well all day, although I did set it with loose powder but had to use some blotting papers after several hours (which is no big deal).  All in all, I'm thrilled with my purchase and can't believe that I actually discovered a drugstore foundation that works as well as high end products.  I definitely recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQZJMLT24RPIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI3LCNY#wasThisHelpful","RQZJMLT24RPIH","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use the Toleraine lotion for normal skin and it works wonders and doesn't cause a reaction of any kind.  After using a retinol product more than a year ago, my skin is now super sensitive and all of my regular products cause red blotches and swelling under my eyes.  But Toleraine lotion and Ultra do not do this at all.  I use the Ultra product as an eye cream, because, after all, an eye cream is just a heavier moisturizer and the Ultra formula works really well for this purpose.  I apply Toleraine lotion after using Murad Sensitive Skin Serum, which hydrates and helps reduce redness.  I then use the Toleraine Ultra cream around my eyes and let these products soak in for about 5 minutes before applying Anthelios SPF 50 Serum.  I live in Florida so a sunscreen is an absolute necessity and my regular brand breaks me out so I'm now using Anthelios and haven't had any reaction so far (although it's a bit greasy in my opinion).  However, the Ultra cream does eliminate the dry scaly patches I have under my eyes and now thanks to this routine, my skin remains clear and free of redness.  Toleraine products work as well or better than the prescriptions I was given by my dermatologist.  If you have dry sensitive skin, the Ultra cream is the perfect product for you. It's thick and rich and for my eyes, I only need half a pump.  I apply it on my lids and under my eyes and it also takes care of the dryness on my lids and makes them much more smooth.  Yes, it's expensive.  However, if you have sensitive skin you've likely tried many different products that have caused a reaction of one kind or another and spent a considerable sum in the process.  I've had this dispenser of Ultra cream for many months and there's still a considerable amount left.  If you're using it for your entire face (it would be especially great in the wintertime) you would likely use it up faster.  But when you consider all the money you've likely wasted searching for products that are gentle enough, you can now be assured that this cream will hydrate without causing a reaction of any kind.  If it works for my hyper sensitive skin, it will work for anyone.  I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJRDHQNNJVNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUHUN18#wasThisHelpful","RTJRDHQNNJVNG","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My skin is super sensitive after using a retinol product more than a year ago.  Before this, my skin wasn't sensitive at all and I usually had no reaction to skincare product whatsoever.  However, I now get red blotches and swelling under my eyes if I use my regular products.  So I had to find products specifically for super sensitive skin.  I found this Murad serum at Ulta and thought I would give it a try.  It's very light and not greasy, probably because it has a generous amount of aloe in it.  It definitely hydrates nicely and helps to minimize redness.  I use it after washing my face with Olay Sensitive Skin Cleanser (which is awesome btw) and I then use La Roche Posay Toleraine Daily Moisturuzer and the heavier Toleraine cream around my eyes.  I let all this soak in and then use La Roche Posay Anthelios SPF 50 Serum as a final step.  Thankfully. my skin has had no reaction to any of these products and I think they make for a good regimen.  The Murad serum feels nice and cool on my face and it dries quickly, leaving no sticky or oily residue.  It hydrates well and leaves my face feeling soft and looking less red.  It's a great initial step in my routine and I will definitely repurchase it.  I don't know whether Murad makes other sensitive skin products (this is the only one that my Ulta carries) but I will definitely check up on it.  If you have very sensitive skin, I highly recommend this serum.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U5LPTAY2OM1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GDC4I2#wasThisHelpful","R2U5LPTAY2OM1M","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fantastic powder definitely makes my hair look cleaner and absorbs excess oil well and imparts a nice, fresh scent.  It's better than any of the spray dry shampoos I've tried and doesn't leave a grayish cast in my dark blond hair.  The powder absorbs oil in about 15 minutes and if you use a scrubbing motion (just like washing your hair) there will be very little visible powder to brush out.  I don't use a lot of this powder, in fact, I think the trick is not to overdo it but I've found that if my hair is very dirty and oily, I get much more volume using this product.  If my hair is too clean, I don't get much volume at all, hence the four stars.  I did have to make the opening in the bottle a bit bigger because nothing was coming out, but that is small negative thing and shouldn't influence your purchase of this product in the least.  I widened the opening with a pair of small scissors and from then on, it worked fine.  This trial size is quite small but it doesn't take much product to do the job so it will last longer than it might at first appear.  I've already purchased the full size and have used it quite often (several times a week) over the last several months and I have nearly half a bottle left.  Yes, it's expensive, but it's so far superior to spray dry shampoo I can't begin to tell you.  Sprays are really messy and the white powder is always a telltale sign that I've used dry shampoo, something I'd rather people not know just by looking at my hair.  I can never get all the white residue out no matter how much I brush with a boar bristle brush (plastic bristles definitely don't work for this maneuver, just fyi).  But Pret a Powder is different.  The powder brushes out easily even though not much remains after 15 minutes or so.  And it definitely makes my hair a bit fluffier to boot.  All in all, I'm really pleased with this product and definitely recommend it for those people who are fed up with spray dry shampoo.  I've also tried other volumizing powders (Beyond the Zone and Osis Dust It) and neither one really took care of the oil or created much lift.  Pret a Powder is better than any other similar product I've used and for me, it's definitely worth the price.  It's also light enough for fine hair and definitely won't weigh it down as long as you use it with a light hand.  I'm happy to go another day or two without washing my hair, which saves me tons of time in the morning.  It makes my hair look fuller and cleaner and that's the whole point, right?","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UTAWNBLUI526/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U7LTRLK#wasThisHelpful","R3UTAWNBLUI526","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice bootie and the low heel means I can wear them all day without worrying about my poor feet.  They were a great buy, priced twice as much on the Aldo website.  They will be great with a leather skirt and with pants and jeans as well.  I like the Chelsea cut and the mod 60s feel.  They fit fine, which is unusual for Aldo shoes because oftentimes they don't come in half sizes, which is what I need (8.5) and the width is fine as well (my width is medium).  I will wear them with socks as well as with tights and they'll be great both ways.  I only wish they were real leather, however, the faux leather looks real and they will be better in winter weather because salt doesn't stain vegan leather like it does the real thing.  All in all, I'm pleased with my purchase and these booties will be great for work because I can't wear heels for more than a few hours and I work long days so something with minimal height works best for me.  I recommend these booties for anyone wanting to channel a little bit of the 60s cool girl vibe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWVL346SDXWRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011D4Q17M#wasThisHelpful","RWVL346SDXWRR","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This spray hardly made any difference at all.  It's super light so it might be great for texturizing really fine hair but for me, it didn't do much of anything at all.  I like Redken Wind Blown much better and adds considerable grip and heft and gives my hair that tousled, bedhead look that is so trendy right now.  AG does add some subtle texture and it would likely be fine for adding texture the 2nd day when there is already considerable product in my hair because it's so light.  However, it's not any better than Fructis Texture Tease, which is a fraction of the price (although there's not much product in the can, unfortunately).  High and Dry does allow me to get a brush through my hair, whereas Wind Blown really doesn't.  A few sprays of WB and my hair has that piecey separation that works so well for layered hair.  High and Dry would be great for updos, adding just enough grip to clean hair to make it easy to style.  All in all, I received this can of High and Dry gratis from a friend, so I can't return it, but I'm not sure it'll be my texturizing spray of choice.  I really prefer Redken Wind Blown because just a few sprays and my hair is bedroom sexy and has that beachy texture everyone wants these days.  I think High and Dry is OK but I'm not planning on purchasing it.  If you really want volume and texture, try Wind Blown instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XB3N0RYVM89W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GS79T5G#wasThisHelpful","R2XB3N0RYVM89W","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This spray doesn't do much at all.  I was looking for a dry texturizing spray that would add substantial heft and grip to my layered lob but this isn't it.  It doesn't add much texture at all, even when I spray a generous amount and it certainly doesn't add any of the promised volume.  It also has a very strong scent.  I have no idea who would use this spray because it doesn't really ""do"" anything.  I much prefer Redken Wind Blown which adds tons of texture in just a few spritzes and gives me the sexy, tousled bedhead look #Iwokeuplikethis.  I was looking for something a bit lighter than Wind Blown but this AG spray is no better than Fructis Texture Tease and is certainly way more expensive (although you do get more product in the AG can).  I consider this product to be a failure, at least for my needs.  I will try to use it again when my hair is clean and my waves are freshly curled to see whether I can get that slept-in texture that's so trendy right now.  But if the second go around fails, it's going back to Ulta.  There's no way I'm paying $22 for a product that will simply sit unused on my bathroom counter.  I will simply buy another Wind Blown, which seems to work better for me.  I do recommend this spray if your hair is really fine because it's super light and will probably add the perfect amount of grip to finer hair than mine.  As for me, I'll give it one more go and if I change my mind for the better, I'll update this review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ITX7BJEYXQK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INY6JFK#wasThisHelpful","R3ITX7BJEYXQK8","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This root concealer works really well for me.  It's the perfect neutral dark blond, which will blend with many different tones of blond hair.  I was looking for a product that would hide my gray and darker virgin hair which begin to show through two weeks after coloring. I've tried several other root concealers but none of them was really satisfactory.  Zotos from Sally's is a decent spray but the color is far too orangey and it took quite a bit of blending with my fingers to get it to work well enough to hide my silvery highlights.  I also tried Hairmarker, which has a sponge applicator and seemed to dry out almost immediately.  I could never get enough product on the applicator and the dark blond shade was very ashy.  I also tried Color Wow, which is just a fancy eyeshadow that doesn't offer much coverage at all unless you apply it on top of wet hairspray and even then, it wears off really quickly. Rita Hazan is perfect though.  The color is a dark neutral blond that will blend will all shades of dark blond hair.  However, the spray comes out really cold so it's a bit uncomfortable for a few seconds.  But this situation passes quickly and it covers my silvery strands as well as the darker virgin tresses really well.  The best part is that it lasts a really long time, even through sleeping, so I often don't need to spray it the next day.  Yes, it's a small container but it's so concentrated that just a few spritzes down my part and on my temples is all I need to disguise my gray regrowth. I wouldn't be surprised if this small can lasted 6 months! However, you must shake the can really well prior to applying it, otherwise you won't get a good saturation of color. It's the perfect solution and enables me to stall retouching my roots for another couple of weeks.  I didn't have much luck with the other root concealing products I tried, but this one is different and so much better than the others.  I absolutely hate it when my gray hair begins to peek out after just two weeks.  I try to color my roots every four weeks, but it's so hard to wait if you don't have some sort of cover up.  Rita Hazan Root Concealer has solved the problem for me.  For $25 I've found the perfect solution for my fast growing hair.  If you buy it at Sephora or Ulta, you can always return it if you don't like it.  However, I think you'll be thrilled with the color and the coverage and will especially like the fact that it lasts until you shampoo it out (which is easy by the way, even with a sulfate free shampoo).  There's simply no negative things I can say about this product.  It has out performed the other brands I tried by a long shot.  I am no longer plagued by unsightly gray roots and no one would ever know I'm not a natural blond, lol!  I put off trying this brand because it was so much more expensive than the others I tried (with the exception of Color Wow which is even pricier) but now I know what all the fuss was about.  It's absolutely amazing and no one need know I have any gray hair at all now, lol!  I highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFL1CO3LHDX8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007K6B4KC#wasThisHelpful","RFL1CO3LHDX8O","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My gray hair starts to peek out two weeks after I color it so I was looking for a product that would hide the silvery highlights until it's time for another touch up. I tried another root concealing spray, Zotos from Sally's, but I wasn't very impressed with it because the dark blond shade was very orangey and my hair is more neutral.  However, I did use it and simply tried to blend the product in with my fingers.  However, in harsh lighting the off color was very noticeable so I stopped using it. The solid powder concealers, such as Color Wow, are nothing more than expensive fancy eyeshadow and they don't really last very long unless you spray hairspray on your part first and while it's wet, apply the powder with a large fluffy brush.  I found this method time consuming for not much coverage and would much prefer a spray concealer that isn't so much work.  I also tried the root concealers that have a mascara wand applicator but found that there wasn't much product in the tube and that it dried out quickly.  Hairmarker didn't work any better and the sponge applicator never seems to have enough product on it, no matter how many times I dipped it and the dark blond shade was very ashy.  So when I purchased this Rita Hazan product I wasn't expecting to like it but made sure that I bought it at Sephora where I could return it if it didn't work out.  The first time I tried it I knew I had found the perfect root concealer.  It's the perfect neutral dark blond, which will blend with many shades, and it definitely covered the gray and helped the darker virgin hair blend in as well.  However, when it first goes on, the spray is very cold and it can be a bit uncomfortable.  But this situation dissipates quickly and once the powder dries, it hides my gray completely.  Be sure and shake the can up really well before you spray, otherwise you won't get nice saturated color.  The color also lasts all day and longer, as long as you don't brush it out.  This is the perfect product to use for those awkward weeks between touch ups when ugly roots start to show.  Although this container seems small, especially for the price, it lasts quite a long time because the spray is so concentrated that just a few spritzes is all it takes to cover my entire part and another spray or two for my temples. I don't even need to use the product every day because the powder clings really well to my hair even while I sleep so a daily spritz is not always necessary.  And this product also washes out very easily, even with sulfate free shampoo.  I like everything about RH Root Concealer and am so glad I finally found the perfect shade and formula.  It's superior in every way to other root concealers I've tried and is definitely worth the price.  I wouldn't be surprised if this spray can lasted me 6 months!  And I call that a true bargain!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G7C4846H840R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BM1V1PY#wasThisHelpful","R3G7C4846H840R","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this product at Sally's because I needed something to hide my silvery roots in between root touch ups.  My gray begins to show after two weeks and I'm just not inclined to color that often so I decided to try this root cover up to see whether I could actually last another couple of weeks.  I only use it in my part and a small area near my temples.  The color is rather warm (a bit orangey) compared to my neutral dark blond but as long as I work it into my roots well with my fingers it blends pretty well.  It definitely hides the silver and masks the darker virgin hair too.  It will work between touch ups and that's why I bought it in the first place.  It goes on like dry shampoo but isn't as powdery and the color lasts until I wash it out.  It keeps me from having to worry about the gray showing through, which is the whole point.  I think it was worth the $7 and although the can is small, it will last a long time because I only need a few spritzes to do my part and temples.  Be careful not to over spray it though because too much product won't blend as easily. All in all, I'll keep this product on my shelf and will definitely use it up.  I'm not sure I'll repurchase it though because, like I said, the color is somewhat off.  I can always use eyeshadow  to do the same thing, just fyi.  I recommend this product if your hair is a warm dark blond.  Otherwise, keep looking for the perfect color.  Spray cover ups definitely work, it's just a matter of finding the perfect shade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNDQB5TJ2H4CB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ESGGQQ#wasThisHelpful","RNDQB5TJ2H4CB","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This spray is not what I thought it was.  I wanted a spray, more like a hairspray, that I could spray at the roots of my finished style that would provide some lift and volume.  This spray doesn't dry quickly and needs the addition of a blowdryer to make it work.  It goes on very wet and is therefore disruptive of my curls (which I spent 15 minutes doing).  I don't know why it's so hard to find a root volumzing spray that works like a hairspray and that dries quickly.  I bought two Jonathan Product Root Lifter sprays at TJ Maxx for $6 apiece and absolutely loved them.  The nozzle was directional and could be aimed right and root for lift and volume.  I guess this spray was discontinued because I can't find anymore anywhere.  I've been searching for something similar and as of now, all my efforts have been a total waste of time and $$.  This spray isn't what I was looking for and therefore will be going back to the store.  I suppose that if you're willing to blowdry and want volume, this might be the perfect product for you.  I did use it once that way but didn't notice any thickening effects or any volume. For me, this product was a complete miss.  I will say that it smells nice, very fruity and light, but the fragrance dissipates quickly.  I'm not impressed with it at all.  If you're looking for something more like a thickening hairspray, I suggest you try Bumble and Bumble Thickening Hairspray which really does add thickness and volume but dries quickly.  This TIGI spray wasn't sticky or stiff, so it has that going for it.  All in all, my search continues and hopefully, there's a decent root volumizing product out there that dries quickly and will add some lift at the crown.  But so far, this effort has been fruitless.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AR7D2SU3NYMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004V42ILU#wasThisHelpful","R1AR7D2SU3NYMC","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a firm believer that great style is something you just can't teach.  It evolves from adolescence onward and is modeled on the way we see the women in our lives dress.  Yes, you can take tips from others and from magazines, etc.  but an innate sense of style is something we're born into.  This book does have some pointers for those people who want to update their look but it isn't a style bible and lacks something crucial that escapes the telling.  Ines may have great personal style and certainly it has gained ground as she rose in the modeling world, but true style is something you just can't teach.  I grew up watching my mother and grandmother dress, who both had impeccable style and grace and certainly much of their style rubbed off on me.  I occasionally imbibe a tip here and there but have basically always followed my own path, regardless of trends.  Parisian style involves mixing the unexpected in new and interesting ways.  The only way to do this is to try different combinations until you find a mix you like and that makes you happy.  If you're not comfortable in your own skin, this method will be very trying.  You'll know you hit on the right combination when the compliments begin to flow.  Frankly, I'm not sure why I bought this book.  It didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know and the presentation lacks a sparkling something that would have made the content more interesting.  Still, it's an OK book, but not one that gets a high recommendation from me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BC51GWQ12OYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2080200739#wasThisHelpful","R3BC51GWQ12OYF","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've finally figured out how to use this spray to the best advantage.  When I purchased it, I was looking for a spray to use on my roots that would give my finished style some volume.  However, this spray is a styling product not a finishing one so it didn't suit my purpose at all.  However, I recently read an article in a fashion magazine that suggested that layering two products is the best way to get nice loose beachy waves and have them hold all day.  I use Living Proof No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray and absolutely love it.  It's truly weightless and I can't feel it in my hair at all and yet it has great hold.  So I sprayed LP on as usual and then added some of Superstar on top.  I then let my hair air dry overnight and used a curling iron in the morning as usual.  I have a layered lob (i.e. long bob) and my main objective was to get volume on the top but using this spray not only gave me great hold, it also definitely made my hair look thicker (and who wouldn't want that?).  This spray definitely requires heat to work and although I'm allergic to the hair dryer (a complete klutz with the round brush, lol!), the heat from the curling iron definitely activated it and it made me look like I have a ton more hair.  While it didn't really add the volume at the roots that I'd hoped for (I'm still looking for a root spray), it made enough of a difference for me to keep using it.  This spray would also work really well for fine hair.  When my hair was finally dry, it was a little stiff until I brushed it through, but this is a minor complaint.  Once I curled it, it had a nice amount of body.  And this spray actually smells pretty nice.  I'm going to keep experimenting with the amount (I used just a small amount the first time) but I certainly noticed a nice difference and the effects lasted all day and into the next.  I did purchase this spray on Amazon, where the price was about $7 less than Ulta's.  It seems the magazine article was right: layering products really does help and gives me the illusion of much more hair.  This spray didn't interfere with the effectiveness of the curling iron either.  I now have a style that looks exactly like the picture I showed my stylist!!  Yay!!  I definitely recommend it if you want thicker looking locks. I'm sure it would work equally well if you blowdry.  Guess I'll be keeping it after all, lol!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q50UH4ALSHEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RS6KU2#wasThisHelpful","R3Q50UH4ALSHEE","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the 3 ounce size of Olaplex No. 3 from my stylist to use at home.  I had No. 1 and No 2 in the salon when I have my color services (highlights with bleach) and my hair felt and looked great, no damage at all.  I wanted to use No. 3 at home to continue the good work.  I used No. 3 on unwashed hair (per the instructions) even though it had considerable product in it and left it in overnight.  The next day I washed and conditioned and let my hair air dry.  Once dry, my hair looked incredibly healthy and shiny and felt just like virgin hair.  Although my hair wasn't severely damaged beforehand, it was quite dry because in addition to regular coloring (permanent color and a demi toner in addition to the salon highlights) I also heat style frequently.  But Olaplex did its awesome work and my hair looks and feels like virgin hair.  No one would know I'm not a natural blond, lol!  I haven't had virgin hair for many decades but this stuff did a great job of restoring my hair to total health.  Olaplex is a bond multiplier, not a protein treatment, and strengthens the desulfide bonds present in healthy hair and depleted in damaged hair.  No 1 has the greatest concentration of the active ingredient (which was originally developed to prevent rejection in organ transplant patients) with No 2 catching those bonds that didn't take with No 1.  No 3 was created as a result of client demand and has the least of the active ingredient.  If your hair is really damaged, you should get all three in the traveling stylist's kit.  However, if your hair is in fair condition, like mine, No 3 will work great.  Just follow the directions because it's not used like a conditioner and the longer you leave it on, the more bonds are created.  You can do a protein treatment in addition to Olaplex because they do different things and both are crucial if you're trying to restore very damaged hair.  A great protein treatment is Apoghee Two Step from Sally's.  There's none better imo and you should follow the directions exactly.  However, I find that when I use Apoghee I need extra hydration so I use a moisturizing mask for 45 minutes with heat in addition to the second moisturizing step.  Olaplex, protein and moisture will work to create a head of very healthy looking hair.  If you use bleach, you should ask your stylist for Olaplex because it makes a huge difference and is worth the extra cost.  I've had balayage with bleach in addition to babylights and both times my stylist used Olaplex and there was absolutely zero damage to my tresses.  But after using No 3, my hair is silky and soft and super shiny.  I will use it at least once a month from now on.  If you can't get Olaplex No 3 from your stylist, you can reliably purchase it on eBay from runwaybeautytrends, which sells the authentic product.  I know several people who purchased from this seller and all of them have reported receiving the real thing.  I have no idea about the sellers on Amazon but check the reviews because fakes are plentiful and the Olaplex bottle is easy to dupe.  If it makes no difference in the condition of your hair, you'll know you got a counterfeit product.  Ebay is the better option.  All in all, I'm loving this stuff right now.  Nothing I've used in the past has made as big an impact as doing a protein, moisture and Olaplex No 3 treatment in succession.  My hair is absolutely gorgeous now!!  I definitely recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20XG7HVT6JNXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015B9A91E#wasThisHelpful","R20XG7HVT6JNXD","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't a spray like hairspray (which is what I wanted), it's a spray mousse.  I wanted something I could spray on the roots that would give my finished style some lasting lift and volume but this spray isn't what I was looking for at all.  It does give some height, which is good, but it's not something can  I use on my finished style after curling.  I will continue my quest for something more like a quick dry hairspray.  I just purchased the TIGI Bedhead Thickening Spray, which will hopefully work the way I want it to.  I love several TIGI products including the Catwalk Strong Mousse and my DIL loves the Lightweight Mousse.  But this spray mousse isn't the right product for my needs so I returned it to Ulta.  The Thickening Spray should do what this product doesn't and will likely give me some lift at the crown and will dry quickly and give me lasting hold.  It's been a long time since I used a thickening spray and years ago, I hated them because they made my hair a tangled, gnarly mess.  Technology has improved and it's likely that this won't happen again.  But if you're looking for a volumizing mousse, you can't go wrong with this Root Boost Spray.  Blowdry your hair upside down for the most lift.  I'm still giving it three stars despite the fact that it isn't the right product for my needs because it does give lift, it's just not the right product to use on a finished style.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VERGPGA49TAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RS6JA8#wasThisHelpful","R3VERGPGA49TAO","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't buy this shampoo and conditioner from Amazon, but from Ulta, so I know they're authentic.  However, they don't work as well as I'd hoped.  My hair is dry from loads of coloring and from regular heat styling so I was looking for something that would quench my parched strands.  But this is not the remedy it was supposed to be.  Yes, it's a luxury product and supposed to be excellent but it doesn't work well for me at all.  I've used more than half of the bottles and my hair is in no better condition than it was at the beginning.  I have to say that it's no worse off, but still, I expected better.  For the price of $64 for this duo, it was surely better than something I could get at the drugstore.  But apparently not.  I have since found the perfect shampoo and conditioner for my dry hair.  Agadir Argan Oil Moisturizing shampoo and conditioner restored my hair in just two uses.  It looks healthy and shiny and it just keeps getting better every time I use them.  I also use the Agadir Argan Oil Treatment, which is a silicone/oil blend that not only zaps frizz but also provides thermal protection due to the silicone.  These three products have given my hair a new lease on life.  The shampoo is sulfate free, so it's color safe and it lathers well, which is unusual for a sulfate free formula.  The conditioner is thick and rich and has a lot of ""slip"" so detangling is easy.  I use about a nickel size dollop of the serum for my below shoulder length hair and it smells really nice and gives me tons of shine, while completely eliminating frizz.  If it works for me in Florida, it will work anywhere, lol!  Alterna is just okay, nothing special and certainly isn't worth the high price tag.  I don't know what all the fuss is about.  Agadir works much better and you can buy the shampoo, conditioner and treatment for about what one bottle of Alterna costs at Ulta.  I'd be a fool to keep using something that just doesn't work.  The question now is what to do with the half bottles of Alterna Caviar?  I definitely don't recommend this shampoo/conditioner for anyone with dry hair.  If you're looking for serious hydration, try Agadir, which works even better than Moroccan Oil imo.  My next step is to try the Agadir mask, which I think will be awesomely wonderful if it's anything like the three Agadir products I've used thus far.  My hair has never looked or behaved better.  Even my stylist has commented on it and that's something that I didn't expect.  Alterna does smell great, I can say that.  But that's about the only good thing I can say has come out of my experience using these products.  My hair needs serious moisture and Alterna just didn't deliver.  I have no clue why there are so many good reviews for these products.  I don't think my situation is anything special. Surely there are a lot of people out there with dry hair and these products are supposed to be moisturizing aren't they?  They aren't exactly an epic fail just a do nothing duo that people with dry hair would be better off passing up.  If you want to cure dry hair in one fell swoop, try Agadir.  Before you waste precious pennies on Alterna, try a less expensive and better alternative.  Agadir will make a believer out of you too, I promise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ91BZ85GZGJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FYV0HM#wasThisHelpful","RQ91BZ85GZGJ9","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lip liner works pretty well to keep lipstick from migrating into the fine lines around my lips. However, it's pretty soft and squishy rather than firm so I don't think the pencil will last very long.  Something happened to my order and it was lost for a while and in the meantime I purchased Urban Decay's Ozone liner (the large one) which is also a clear pencil designed to keep lipstick from running.  It's a firmer pencil than Mary Kay and it seems to work quite well.  I keep both the Mary Kay and the UD in my purse and use them interchangeably.  A clear pencil definitely keeps lipstick in it's place especially those really moisturizing formulas that are somewhat liquidy.  I'm not sure I'll repurchase the MK pencil but it was a bargain compared to UD but likely won't last as long, so there you go.  A conundrum.  I do like the larger size of the UD pencil because it covers my lips with just a swipe or two.  However, it works best when allowed to set for a few minutes.  The MK pencil doesn't do this and letting it set seems to make no difference in its performance.  I like it well enough and for the price it's decent.  I just don't think I would buy it again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JZNZYZ6QCKK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYZ8KRQ#wasThisHelpful","R2JZNZYZ6QCKK2","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This spay works really well and the 1 ounce size is $14 at Sephora, so you might want to think twice before ordering from this Amazon seller.  It works great on my somewhat oily skin and helps my makeup stay fresh throughout the day.  It works much better than any other setting spray I've tried.  I originally purchased the small travel size just to test it out but as soon as I used it up, I purchased the full size because now I can't live without it.  All I need to do is blot my face with blotting paper about 6 hours in and after that, my makeup stays perfect and fresh.  This spray does take quite a few minutes to actually dry so don't touch your face during that time.  But once dry, it seems to control excess oil while leaving a nice somewhat dewy finish that looks youthful not a cracked or dry finish like some oil control products.  I'm still surprised that I can check my makeup after quite a few hours and it still looks like I just put it on.  I first tested this spray out on my son's wedding day, which happened to fall on a day with an unbearable October heat wave.  My makeup looked great despite the heat and other than a blot or two, looked freshly applied for the entire afternoon and night.  It definitely passed my test and if it can hold up in the Florida heat and humidity, it can work anywhere.  I now use this spray on a daily basis and I think it makes a huge difference.  This spray is absolutely amazing and I recommend it for anyone who wants to have her makeup look perfect for many hours.  Just a spritz or two is all it takes. I should also mention that my skin is very sensitive and I didn't experience any breakouts or rashes after using this spray.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because I wish it had some sunscreen in it.  But hey, it's great as it is and if you're having problems with your makeup not lasting, this is the best spray to fix the problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KFSJSPADBZQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYAX9YS#wasThisHelpful","R3KFSJSPADBZQP","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the only mascara that keeps the curl in my lashes.  I use an eyelash curler that I warm up with a hair dryer so I get a nice bend to my lashes.  Regular mascara doesn't keep the curl and although I like the fact that I can apply several coats, my lashes are stick straight in an hour, which is unacceptable.  I've tried other waterproof mascaras (Loreal Intenza, Lash Sensational) but for whatever reason, they don't keep the curl as well as this Rocket waterproof mascara.  With Rocket, I get tons of nice volume, even with one coat (it's impossible to do multiple coats with a waterproof formula because it dries too quickly).  I've tried using several coats of  regular mascara and then finishing with a coat of Rocket waterproof, but my lashes don't stayed curled as well as they do with just one really good coat of Rocket waterproof.  And this formula is definitely waterproof and is going nowhere once it's dry.  The brush does get every single lash pretty well and I've gotten no clumps to speak of.  It coats my lashes with very dark color and thickens well, almost making my lashes look like falsies.  As I've gotten older my once thick lashes have thinned out somewhat but they're still long and this mascara is the best mascara I've tried in a long time and I don't get mascara marks on my brow bone.  I recently purchased Diorshow regular mascara but wasn't impressed and it definitely didn't hold the curl, even when topped with a waterproof formula.  Right now I'm using the Dior eyelash primer, which does adds some thickness because it has very tiny fibers that add considerable volume.  I then top it off with a coat of Rocket waterproof and I'm good to go and my lashes stay curled pretty well throughout the day.  I only wish I was able to apply multiple coats, but alas, that's true with any waterproof formula.  I've also tried other high end mascaras (regular formulas) only to be disappointed. I've learned my lesson (a very expensive one unfortunately) and will be using Rocket waterproof from now on. It's easily removed with a cleansing oil or even olive or grapeseed oil but stays put until you take it off.  I've had no issues with losing lashes while using it as long as I remove it at the end of the day.  I definitely recommend this mascara, especially if you're having trouble getting the curl to stay all day.  This is the best formula for that purpose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZSDYWBM3WTPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYR11KM#wasThisHelpful","R2ZSDYWBM3WTPO","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ""rose"" blush has a peachy undertone so it's not a true rose.  It has substantial gold shimmer, which may be too much for daytime wear.  It does go on very smoothly and is highly pigmented, especially for a drugstore formula.  I suggest using just a touch of this blush, going very easy until you are well acquainted with how it performs.  A fluffy brush is the best application method, imo.  It does give a luminous finish so if you're not into shimmery products and prefer matte finishes, then this isn't the blush product for you.  It does wear well throughout the day, which is surprising for so economical a product.  I do blend it in with loose powder on top, so that may help with its staying power. This blush is a great dupe for Nars Orgasm, which is a pinky peach with gold shimmer.  Unfortunately, I already own Orgasm so this blush is something I don't need and probably won't use it unless I finish up Orgasm and decide not to purchase another one (unlikely).  I don't think this Milani blush wears quite as well as Nars, which lasts all day without a touch up.  I wanted an actual rosy color but the addition of so much gold makes this blush more orange than rose (pink + gold= peach).  Still, it's a great product for the money and I might use it a few more times but go back to CVS and purchase a Milani color that's actually rose.  I recommend this blush for anyone on a budget and for anyone who wants the look of Orgasm without the high price tag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W0E2UV6ZFS4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052D4EIE#wasThisHelpful","R2W0E2UV6ZFS4P","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't really a concealer at all.  It doesn't hide my dark circles and actually makes them look rather gray.  I can't understand the cult status of this product at all.  It perhaps works better as a highlighter but it certainly isn't for concealing.  The texture is pretty thin and liquidy although it is easy to blend.  But for my purposes it was a complete fail.  Although it doesn't really crease once set with loose powder, it doesn't hide anything.  I bought two shades of this for $45 apiece and I was hoping that for that price I would get a true gem.  But alas, this was not to be.  I've had both tubes for quite some time and I refuse to throw them out because I paid so much for them.  I might try using them as highlighters on the center of my forehead and down the bridge of my nose.  At least that way I'd be able to use them and might get my money's worth.  Both colors are really too light, although my complexion is light.  The lightest shade, #1, would be more suitable for super pale skin tones.  I wish like heck I hadn't wasted so much money on these products.  If I can't find some way to use them, then I might as well have flushed my cash down the toilet.  This is just another example of a high end product that many people have been brainwashed into buying because of the stellar magazine reviews.  You have to remember that beauty editors receive products gratis in exchange for good reviews.  I suspect that if these same editors had to actually fork out the dollars to purchase these products, the reviews would be more truthful and many cult status products wouldn't be so highly touted.  All in all, if you want to use this product as a concealer, reconsider.  It's too thin to hide anything, including dark circles, and the colors leave a lot to be desired.  I definitely don't recommend this product and I'm hard pressed to find a use for the two I purchased.  Look at all the reviews before making up your mind.  I'm positive you'll find some that are in line with mine.  On Amazon, this product has an average of four stars, which means there are plenty of reviews that are three stars or less.  I wouldn't give an Indian nickel for this stuff.  I'm so upset I wasted nearly $100 on two of these ""concealers""/ ""highlighters"".  Next time, I'll be more careful about spending my money for cult status products and if I decide to take the plunge, I'll buy them from a store that allows returns.  I ordered these online but in the future, I'll take the time to drive to a store where they carry what I'm looking for.  I'd rather waste some gas and have a nice shopping day than have two products that I can't use.  I definitely don't recommend this product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XZTL5C8SA4YC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009HJBPE#wasThisHelpful","R2XZTL5C8SA4YC","A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have heard the saying ""friends don't let friends buy soundbars"" and for the most part I do agree. Much of what I have seen offered in big box marts is really just awful, cheap garbage and a waste of money. This item is really a cut above the rest. Now if I can't convince you to toss this money towards building a nice system with Sony's freestanding speakers (which I happen to have myself)  then at least go big and get a good sound bar. This one will knock your socks off and takes up less space than 2 floor speakers, a sub, centers, bookcase speakers plus receiver.This is a heavy item, but the bar itself is light and large. By far the sub is the beastie of the package and you may want someone to help unpack and mount this. Overall, maybe a touch high on the price point, but the quality is there to justify it imho. Inspect the box well before signing. Mine looked fine, then I looked on the other side and there was a gouge out of the cardboard with foam coming apart. Sony aced the packing of this, too.

"This thing is a tank. Wow..I was able to review little cousin to this beastie, then was offered to review this product as well. I had been so against HP and their approach to ink (both price and waste) and was so happy to see Epson and Cannon take baby steps towards righting this issue for the consumer. Epson just barged ahead in this endeavor with the WorkForce series. I love the refillable tanks. I have a job working from home (and attend college with my husband half time and teach three kids online full time) and I print. I print a LOT. This printer looks like it might actually stand up to the demands of my household. I might actually be OK on ink for awhile - I hope!If you are the occasional or novelty printer you may want to look at a few other products in this series. This beastie is best suited for somebody who has a no-kidding need for a printer that is the center of their day. Even if you don't flinch at the price tag believe me you will flinch when you have to find a place to put this puppy. 2 people are needed to get it out of the box and hoisted up to its home. It needs a solid table or a large printer stand. It is heavy, wide, tall and did I mention heavy??

"The major complaint with Watch Dogs is that the parts which are enjoyable have been done better in other games -- and made more sense in other games. Watch Dogs can't quite figure out what it wants to be and finds itself unable to fully commit to anything. Strung together by a story line that never quite sets its hooks, the experience is like eating a seven-course dinner where each dish is individually good but the whole doesn't work together.Despite the complaints, the game is fun. Walking down the street and seeing intimate information about people provides a voyeuristic charm. Figuring out the best way to utilize the character's many hacking abilities is interesting. The skill trees feel a little bit forced but do provide a good structure for choosing where you want to improve and the kind of game you want to play (e.g. sneaker, shooter, or other).GraphicsThe game is very good visually; there's enough detail in the background -- cars, people, etc, to keep the player immersed -- but it lacks the beauty of games like Grand Theft Auto 5 or Skyrim.At the game's best, when you're hacking or trying a bonus game, the visuals can be exciting (for example, driving through demons while the city burns in the background). However, for most of the game, the visual are standard fare. (Keep in mind, I'm playing this on the Xbox 360 and not the Xbox One.)SoundCars, screams, gunshots, talking; they are all there and they are all good. The soundtrack was uninspiring for a game that can't seem to decide whether it wants to outdo Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row. On other games I've played, I'd find myself singing along with a song. Watch Dogs did not offer the same level of pleasure.ControlsThe controls are basic for most things. Want to shoot, drive, run, walk, reload, or whatever?  There's a button for that. What really sets this game apart (no surprise) is the hacking, which Watch Dogs does well, whether blowing up a charge or changing lights at the right time. Hacking adds something that makes the controller feel a little more fresh in your hands.Game playThe hacking is fun and the repetitive parts of the game are made less annoying by being fairly quick. Hacking adds a dimension to this game that makes you think in a way different from other games. Perhaps the closest thing I can liken it to is a mundane version of Shadow Run, where hacking replaces magic.Rating: Three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHQU535O6HZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGD6LMG#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHQU535O6HZ0","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Moen's single-handle, high arc design is a huge improvement over the standard bathroom faucet, especially those chrome-plasticy models that sell for less than $50.The brushed chrome finish and sleek design are eye-catching but it is the smooth, one-handle lever that is this model's best feature. The placement of the stopper lever, behind the body of the unit, adds to the clean design. The handle is easy to use, not too tight and not too loose. The tension is gentle yet firm enough for all ages to operate.Plus, the Moen 6190 offers water savings, without sacrificing pressure ""feel."" A tool is included that allows the owner to easily remove the aerator for cleaning, as needed.Measure twice to ensure this high arc design is compatible with your bathroom. The faucet complies with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) specifications but a low-hanging cupboard or medicine cabinet might conflict with the faucet. (I'd rather move the medicine cabinet than keep an old faucet.)Installation is a single-hole mount, although the 6"" x 2"" cover plate can fit over existing two-hole or three-hole sinks.

"The book's size and layout work against the reader. Rotating the book back and forth to view landscape and portrait illustrations is not ideal when reading with a child on your lap.The suggested audience (kindergarten to third grade) simply isn't realistic. As you would expect from a picture book, the illustrations are designed to entertain kindergarten-age children not third-grade students. Some of the acrylic illustrations are vivid and eye-catching while others with dark color mixes distract from the narrative.Speaking of the narrative, the rhyming verse and vocabulary are inconsistent. For example:""Stir-fries and soupare no life for me.I want to grow upand find out what I'll be.""Not many 4-year-olds are acquainted with stir fry (my sons, Kai and Kou, being an exception), much less the concept of ""no life for me.""

"With Eklund Essential Omega Norwegian Fish Oil, I don't experience the fishy aftertaste, belching or heartburn that I experienced from other brands.I appreciate that these softgels are easier to swallow than either Kirkland Signature Omega-3 Fish Oil or the NOW Foods Omega-3 Mini Softgels. The natural lemon flavor of Eklund Essential Omega isn't unpleasant; there's no hint of fish flavor.Each Eklund Essential Omega softgel has 800 mg. of Omega 3 fatty acids, 430 mg. of EPA and 290 mg. of DHA. A suggested use on the bottle is for three softgels daily, taken with meals.Eklund touts its industry-leading purity and freshness. Each batch is individually tested for over 254 contaminants including 220 Pesticides, 6 Heavy Metals, and 7 PCB's.That higher quality does come at a cost. Elklund Essential Omega is more than twice the price per softgel of either Kirkland Signature or NOW Foods brands. However, it is worth noting that Eklund guarantees its Essential Omega, offering a full refund if the customer is not completely satisfied.Rating: Five stars (Five stars for quality; four stars for price)BTW: WebMD provides valuable health information that is timely and credible. Here's the benefits the website lists for Omega-3 Fatty Acids:* Blood fat (triglycerides). Fish oil supplements can lower elevated triglyceride levels. Having high levels of this blood fat puts you at risk for heart disease. DHA alone has also been shown to lower triglycerides.* Rheumatoid arthritis. Fish oil supplements (EPA+DHA) can curb stiffness and joint pain. Omega-3 supplements also seem to boost the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drugs.* Depression. Some researchers have found that cultures that eat foods with high levels of omega-3s have lower levels of depression. Fish oil also seems to boost the effects of antidepressants and may help the depressive symptoms of bipolar disorder.* Baby development. DHA appears to be important for visual and neurological development in infants.* Asthma. A diet high in omega-3s lowers inflammation, a key component in asthma. But more studies are needed to show if fish oil supplements improve lung function or cut the amount of medication a person needs to control the condition.* ADHD. Some studies show that fish oil can reduce the symptoms of ADHD in some children and improve their mental skills, like thinking, remembering, and learning. But more research is needed in this area, and omega-3 supplements should not be used as a primary treatment.* Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Some research suggests that omega-3s may help protect against Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and have a positive effect on gradual memory loss linked to aging. But that's not certain yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29RMMG0PNWXHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009HEZ03W#wasThisHelpful","R29RMMG0PNWXHT","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have two sons who are currently studying in the fourth- and fifth grades. They are sponges, absolutely ripe for music, math, language and science, especially when it is delivered in as entertaining a form as Mark Miodownik's Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World.I picked up the book for myself, having just finished a couple rather dour non-fiction books on politics and race relations. Miodownik's enthusiasm for his subject and his cheery writing style captured my attention from the first chapter.His book is a fascinating read delivered in a conversational style that makes it easy to share with my 11-year old and 10-year old sons. That's a rare treat in this medium, whereas we often share science documentaries on the Discovery Channel or PBS. I'm looking forward to having my sons share the book next with their grandfather next.The book has a charming ability that makes it difficult to look at these materials - glass, concrete, steel and plastic - the same way again.Rating: Five starsOn a related note, I've recently reviewed two illustrated books from DK Publishing that are for the young adult audience. I recommend both History Year by Year and Firearms: An Illustrated History and would love to see a similar treatment applied to Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World.Both of the DK Publishing books are filled with full-color photos and graphics; and large enough to cover a kid's lap. ""Firearms: An Illustrated History"" is 12 x 10.3 x 1.2 inches and ""History Year by Year"" is 10.9 x 8.8 x 1 inches.Miodownik's essay on metal, specifically stainless steel, would make a fantastic illustration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS6Y3IEDZ9CM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544236041#wasThisHelpful","RS6Y3IEDZ9CM6","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a happy owner of the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX Standing Polyurethane Origami Case. In fact, I own two cases for each Kindle Fire HDX. Still, I was willing to try out another case, especially when it retails for half the price of the Origami.Two things jumped out for me when I first saw the Tek-nical Case by Incipio: there's an elastic band to hold the Kindle Fire HDX in place and there are no magnets, which on the Origami allows me to automatically turn off my Kindle Fire HDX when I close it.It isn't realistic to expect either the Tek-nical Case or the Origami Case to save the Kindle Fire HDX from a 10-foot drop onto concrete. In our household, the cases are used to protect the screen from spills and scratches. So, the Tek-nical Case lack of functions really puts it behind the Origami Case.CONS:* The Tek-nical Case is only stable for landscape hands-free viewing. In portrait mode, the case slides and wobbles.* There are no magnets, so the Kindle Fire HDX won't automatically turn off when the case is closed.* The elastic band has a cheap feel and doesn't inspire confidence.You get what you pay for. If price is your first consideration, the Tek-nical Case will probably fit your needs. If functionality is more important to you, I recommend the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX Standing Polyurethane Origami Case.Rating: Three stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FS36O1ROUUYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GA562HO#wasThisHelpful","R3FS36O1ROUUYE","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dear Mr. Castle,We can't thank you enough for upgrading to the OXO Good Grips Complete Grate and Slicer Set. The OXO safety features are important to us, especially the non-slip feet, the secure container handles and the food holder.The slicers and graters fit neatly into the container, which eliminates the risk of reaching into a kitchen drawer and withdrawing a bloody finger. You remember that time you jammed an antique cheese grater into the drawer and it popped out like a spring? Whew! We were lucky to avoid a trip to the emergency room.In addition to the safety features, we like the design and bright colors of this four-piece set. The compact design saves kitchen space, too.We're feeling much better about your grating and slicing plans.Sincerely,Your Fingers (and Thumbs, too!)BTW: We own and recommend the following OXO products, too.* OXO Good Grips Smooth Edge Can Opener* OXO Stainless Steel Strainer, Double Rod* OXO Good Grips Angled Measuring Cup* OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10LYUIVP66C9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEZ8A6K#wasThisHelpful","R10LYUIVP66C9N","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Samson Expedition XP308i 300-Watt Portable PA is a great value that offers an outstanding combination of portability, convenience and versatility for indoor and outdoor venues.We put the PA system to the test at a co-worker's 70th birthday party. It was an indoor-outdoor event at his home, so the system was set up on the covered back deck. He used the iPod dock to play recorded music. The system's performance was outstanding.I can't say enough about the portability. Snapped together, the compact PA system - dual 2-way speakers, an on-board mixer and 300-watt power amplifier - weighs a manageable 30 pounds, making it a breeze to transport. Everything connects into one case with rubber handles: one speaker stores the mixer in the back and the other speaker stores the cables.Equally important is the fact that setup only took a few minutes. Even though the manual is a bit light, the party host was able to hook it up the PA system even though his audio experience is limited. Experienced operators will appreciate the portability and value in this Samson package, features that won't be lost on novices as well.Several other reviewers mentioned the cooling fan noise. It is noticeable in a quiet room, for example if used for a church performance. However, on the back deck at the birthday party, there was enough background noise to cancel out the cooling fan.The built-in iPod dock was the only frustrating feature because the connector doesn't fit all iPod models without an adapter. That problem has more to do with Apple and its aging line of iPods than Samson, so I'm not going to drop a star from my rating.In summary, the Samson Expedition XP308i 300-Watt Portable PA is an outstanding value at this price range that is convenient, versatile and performs well for both outdoor events and small-to-medium-sized indoor venues.CONS:If you own an older iPod model, you might need an adapter to use the mixer's built-in dock.No Sub Out; a minor quibble.Rating: Five stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36MZYB3020VZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BSH9SU#wasThisHelpful","R36MZYB3020VZD","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Proof that there is still much to mine from America's fascination with chefs and professional kitchens, author Simon Wroe delivers a dark, funny and sometimes grotesque meal that is loaded with hard-to-shake images, profanity and a kitchen environment that could easily be mistook for a torture chamber in just under 300 pages.Readers hoping for Julia Child recipes woven into the narrative will be shocked by the brutal and illegal operations and dealings that occur in the Swan, an upscale London restaurant where our nameless narrator, a novice chef, toils away with a band of misfits who alternately curse and delight in this grubby space.Wroe, a former chef, draws from a rich, personal environment for his debut novel. He manages to infuse the book with energy and colorful language that equally entertain. Anyone with even a hint of professional kitchen experience will wince, laugh and nod along as Wroe reveals the brutal, sweaty business of restaurants.In summary, Chop, Chop makes a perfect summer read: fast, funny and entertaining.Rating: Five stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q4MY1A5CY3YH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205795#wasThisHelpful","R3Q4MY1A5CY3YH","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My second experience with Arriba! Salsa resulted in a perfect combination of fire-roasted flavor and layered heat. The combo pack is two jars of Medium Chipotle Salsa and two jars of Medium Green Salsa.I gave a three-star review for Arriba! Fire Roasted Mexican Hot Red Salsa last month, a free sample provided through Amazon's Vine program. Here's what I wrote about that variety:""I opened a jar and tried it over three different meals: a lunch of chicken nachos; a dinner of bean burritos; and a dinner of fish tacos. In each and every case, the salsa overpowered the dish. My sons, ages 11 and 9, also tried the salsa. (They have their own condiment bottles of sriracha.) They came to the same conclusion: the hot red salsa was too strong.""The Medium Chipotle Salsa (the smoky flavor of chipotle peppers) marries well with nachos and burritos while the Medium Green Salsa (fire-roasted green tomatoes and tomatillos) was best on scrambled eggs with a pinch of melted mozzarella. Unlike the hot salsa, my sons had no trouble enjoying these medium salsas. My wife noted the fire-roasted flavor, which included burnt bits of peppers. She recently added a spoonful to her Mexican rice recipe.Again, I am impressed by the easily-pronounceable list of ingredients in Arriba! Fire Roasted Salsas.Medium Chipotle Salsa: Tomato, Jalapeno, Chipotle Pepper (Chipotle Pepper, Tomato, Salt, Sesame Oil, Paprika, Vinegar and Spices), Cilantro, Onion, Garlic, Carrots, Vinegar, Salt, and Sesame Oil.Medium Green Salsa: Tomatoes, tomatillas, serrano peppers, cilantro, onions, garlic, carrots, vinegar, salt, sesame oil, and spicesThe price is roughly $5 per jar, which is reasonable considering the quality. I would drop a star from my rating if the price climbs much higher.Rating: Five starsADDENDUM: Riba Foods produces the Arriba! brand of fire-roasted salsa as well as pepper sauces, bar-b-que sauces and the Texas Pepper Works brand of bread and butter-type pickles, peppers, and mustard. I recommend the Texas Pepper Works brand as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T315FYXNLBD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIVYCDA#wasThisHelpful","R1T315FYXNLBD9","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Touted as ""the first comprehensive critique of the War on Terror's new front -- the specter of domestic terrorists, Arun Kundnani's ""The Muslims are Coming!"" failed to engage me. In fact, the book more often felt like an overwrought term paper with barely a paragraph between citations.Part of my disappointment with this book is that it doesn't compare well against another book I was reading at the same time. The other book, Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class by Ian Haney Lpez, offered a tighter narrative but no less depressing a topic.There were several factoids in this book that provided new information for me. For example, I was stunned to read that ""the Somali population in the Twin Cities is the largest in North America."" I would have liked to read more about why this location was chosen but the author delved no further than to write, ""Minnesota has a history of refugee settlement...""Credit the publisher, Verso, for tagging the book with a play on the classic film, The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming.

"Any doubt that dog whistles - code words that turn Americans against each other - is a relevant topic in 2014 is illustrated by Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling.Author Ian Haney Lpez was interviewed on Bill Moyers' PBS show last February. He described the motivation behind the political tactic, the ""dark magic"" used to seduce middle-class voters.""It comes out of a desire to win votes,"" Haney Lpez told Moyers. ""And in that sense... It's racism as a strategy. It's cold, it's calculating, it's considered, it's the decision to achieve one's own ends, here winning votes, by stirring racial animosity.""It would be hard to say from which political perspective (party) this book touches most. For a Republican, it is a reminder that the party's appeal to white Americans includes a racist element. For a Democrat, the book serves as a scorecard for the party's failure to illuminate and defeat dog whistle strategies.The book is even-handed and well researched, but not entertaining like All's Fair: Love, War, and Running for President. I imagine the book elicits outrage in many readers but, for me, it was a dour read. Several times, I wanted to stop reading because the subject matter is so depressing.

"Hungry really doesn't describe it. My sons are voracious, ravenous...insatiable. They come home from school and scour for snacks. They do their homework before leaving for swim practice.

Sometimes, they grab another snack before and after the meal.And, oh my, the weekends are like a plague of locusts.I picked up the first bag of Chef Piggy Tail Microwave Pork Puffies Pork Rinds with Amazon's Add-on program, which ships products with qualifying orders over $25.

"Buying this book with an Encyclopedia Britannica-sized expectation will set you on a course for disappointment. DK Publishing excels at merging history and factoids with colorful photos and graphics. This isn't a 30-volume collection of everything under the sun.For my sons (ages 11 and 10), Firearms: An Illustrated History is yet another treasure trove of entertaining learning that nicely complements History Year by Year, another exceptional reference book for young readers published in association with the Smithsonian Institution.My review for ""History Year by Year"" began as follows: ""Forgive me for a moment if I can't help giggling. I can't help but think of the Seinfeld episode, `The Bookstore,' where Jerry and George are at Brentano's and George borrows a large book to accompany him into the bathroom.""The point then and now is that my sons carry these books with them everywhere. It is beside their cereal bowls at breakfast, in their beds for nighttime reading and smuggled into the bathroom for casual browsing.Both books are more than 300 pages and large enough to cover a kid's lap. ""Firearms: An Illustrated History"" is 12 x 10.3 x 1.2 inches and ""History Year by Year"" is 10.9 x 8.8 x 1 inches.I interviewed my oldest son, Kai, because, so far, he's outmaneuvered his younger brother and me to spend the most time with the book.So, how would you rate the book?""I'd give it four and a half stars.""Why not five?""In the disguised firearms section (page 300), the picture doesn't show the barrel for the knife gun,"" Kai said, flipping the pages. ""And, in the special purpose firearms section (page 222), you can't really tell from which side the single-shot cigarette pistol fires."" More page flipping.""Also, I wanted to see more sides of the Dolne Apache pistol (page 220).""Well, you know I'll round up, so four and a half stars becomes five.""That's OK. I really like the book. I just like some more photos of these special firearms.""With that he gave me a goodnight hug before tucking the book under his arm and heading off to bed.I recommend checking a few pages for yourself using Amazon's 'Look Inside' feature on this product page.

"The B-Daman Crossfire Break Bomber Battlefield Set is an eye-catching toy, especially with the Thunder Dracyan and Lightning Dravise figures. However, the game's style points are squandered with plastic flimsiness and a lack of replay value.Probably the fastest thing you'll discover about the B-Daman Crossfire Break Bomber Battlefield Set is how quickly it will bore your children. My sons (11-year old and 10-year old) played the game twice, each winning a game, before they asked me if they could stop and go play with something else.""It felt like Pokemon and not as strategic as Magic the Gathering,"" said Kai, my 11-year old. ""It isn't as fun as it looks. The game says it is for ages six and up but it really is too simple for kids older than 8.""PROBLEMS* The trigger is touchy. B-Da marbles stick in the magazine.* Once the B-Daman figures is loaded with B-Da marbles, the figure is top heavy and easily falls over.* When marbles strike each other, especially the heavier marbles, they tend to fly outside the Break Bomber Battlefield.* The B-Daman figures are not durable. I cautioned my sons to play with them gently but it is easy to see why so many people report the game breaks.Rating: One star.BTW: If the Japanese B-Daman toys seem familiar, that's because the toy industry has become quite adept at squeezing huge profits out of combining animated TV shows and collectible toy sets.

"On a lazy Saturday morning, the whispering from the kitchen grew louder.""No. You put your finger in it.""""No. You do it.""My wife and I sat in the living room, wondering if we should get up, wondering if we should be more nervous when the kitchen went quiet.A couple minutes passed. Then, our sons carried in four bowls of hot McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal topped with sliced bananas, courtesy of the HomeFlav Monkey Loves Banana Slicer.Conversation progressed as we enjoyed breakfast. Our sons slowly detailed their kitchen experiment: the slicer was sharp enough to cut through hot dogs, cheese sticks and, finally, celery. Actually, the celery didn't cut cleanly, the fibers dangling like loose strings.Then, one brother dared the other to put his finger in the slicer. Dare. Double Dare. Double Dog Dare. Still, with no takers, they turned their attention to bananas.And those came out perfectly. The slices are thin enough to top either a bowl of oatmeal or a plate of waffles.Most bananas in our household end up in smoothies, so we don't use the slicer except on the weekends when we enjoy a slower family breakfast.I asked my wife what she liked most about the HomeFlav Monkey Loves Banana Slicer.""I like that I don't have to clean a cutting board,"" she said. ""I can drop the slices right into the food.""The slicer is durable enough to be used in a busier operation, like a child care facility, where it can get enough use to justify its place in the kitchen utensil drawer.The slicer is easy to clean but do so with care.

"""I'm making pizza. Pizza! Pizza!

For nearly two months, she's tested the YazyCraft Rainbow Dough Tools Kit with at least 20 children each day.The only tool in the kit to fail this durability test was the straight dough-cutting wheel. The wheel came off too easily and too often, so my wife finally put it away.Her students use the other five tools with Play-Doh and PlayFoam. They use the hand roller to make cookies with PlayFoam; the rolling pins to make pies and cookies with the Play-Doh; and the spatula to engage in spirited sword fighting, which is why the spatula is sometimes put away, too.I asked my wife to compare the YazyCraft Rainbow Dough Tools Kit with the toys you can find in a dollar store.""The YazyCraft kit is more durable and the dollar store quality isn't even close,"" she said.

"I wish I had bought these pro-grade spatulas many years ago. The frustration of cooking with (and trying to clean) cheaper spatulas was evident the first time I used di Oro's silicone spatula set.The set includes a large (11.2"" / 28.5cm) silicone spatula, a large (11.2"" / 28.5cm) silicone spoon and a small (8.8"" / 22.3cm) silicone spatula, which is perfect for reaching into jars.I purchased the set because I wanted a seamless, one-piece design. I was tired of fighting to clean out all of the food that gets trapped between the handle and spatula head. I was also tired of having handles bend and break.The di Oro spatula set comes with ""S-Core Internal Stainless Steel Handle Support Technology"" that greatly increases the tools' stability, strength, and leverage. The set also features a textured finish that prevents slipping.On top of all of that, di Oro offers a lifetime guarantee against defects in materials or workmanship.

I can expect to spend $6-$10 for a cheap spatula at a discount store.Once I used the di Oro spatulas, I was reminded again of Aldo Gucci's words, ""The bitterness of poor quality is remembered long after the sweetness of low price has faded from memory.""Once you use di Oro's seamless, silicone spatulas you will never go back to the cheaper models.Rating: Five stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROODDGR2B059D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWVRW3Y#wasThisHelpful","ROODDGR2B059D","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What's the difference between fudge and chocolate? I pose the question because, as I shared Tobermory Single Malt Scotch Whisky Fudge with friends, several asked if this was really fudge or caramel.It is all a bit confusing, especially when a search on the internet produces pages of recipes for ""Chocolate Caramel Fudge"" (!) and ""Chocolate Fudge Cupcakes with Salted Caramel Frosting.""I dug a bit further and found this:* Caramel is sugar, and can be combined with milk or cream.* Toffee is sugar, and can be combined with sugar and butter* Fudge is sugar, milk and butter, and can be combined with chocolate.* Chocolate is a bean.So, caramel, toffee and fudge are all sugar. The difference is sugar concentration and temperature, specifically:* Fudge: Soft-Ball Stage (234 F-240 F /112 C-115 C); Sugar concentration: 85%; Soft ball: A small amount of syrup dropped into chilled water forms a soft, flexible ball, but flattens like a pancake after a few moments in your hand.* Caramel: Firm-Ball Stage (242 F-248 F /116 C-120 C); Sugar concentration: 87%; Firm ball: Forms a firm ball that will not flatten when removed from water, but remains malleable and will flatten when squeezed.* Toffee -- Hard-Ball Stage (250 F-268 F /121 C-131 C); Sugar concentration: 92%; Hard ball: At this stage, the syrup will form thick, ""ropy"" threads as it drips from the spoon.That all seems a bit much for sharing a piece of candy with friends but the experience illustrated cultural nuances (i.e. expectations) of what fudge should taste like. For some Americans, fudge is synonymous with chocolate.Tobermory Single Malt Scotch Whisky Fudge is not a chocolate experience. The fudge is sweet, creamy and smoky with a pleasing aroma of single malt scotch. The texture is soft but slightly grainy (sugary) and will literally melt in your mouth.I shared the fudge with co-workers, ranging in age from 30 to 70, and with my family, including my two sons (ages 10 and 9). The flavor didn't suit my sons. I found that the older the person, the more they enjoyed this particular flavor. Still, younger people liked it, although they described the taste as caramel instead of fudge.Every scotch and whisky drinker asked me where they could buy more.In summary, while this is not a chocolate fudge experience, it is a mouth-watering treat all the more delicious when shared. I purchased two more cans and gave them away as gifts. Both recipients reported they loved Tobermory Single Malt Scotch Whisky Fudge.Rating: Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZWTEMMXRIFHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BRLYBW#wasThisHelpful","RZWTEMMXRIFHF","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After learning about the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle, I switched to a standing desk. I found an old, four-drawer desk once used for the production of a weekly newspaper. It is now a converted (three drawer), stand-up writing desk with a shiny, smooth lacquered finish. I love the desk and I'm adjusting to the switch of working from a standing position.One drawback of an old desk is that the drawers are a bit sticky. I was told to use an old fashioned remedy, paraffin wax, to treat the drawers and wood runners for smooth operation.I went to a big box home improvement store but they had nothing in stock to treat old wooden drawers. I then went to a local hardware store but all they had in stock was Lundmark Wax Pure Bee's Wax, which came in a 0.7-ounce package for $4.49. Unsure if it would be enough for the job, I also purchased a 1-pound package of Gulf Wax on Amazon for $7.75. (Lesson: The time and gasoline spent driving around to shop could have been better spent had I gone to Amazon first.)I found a piece of advice about how often to apply the wax: [[""once a day for a week, once a week for a month, once a month for a year, then once a year for life."" That's mainly for finishing with wax, not lubricating, but it still applies to some degree. You want to reapply frequently for a while because the wax will work itself into the pores of the wood (and get scraped off the surface). After a while, you don't need to do it so often, but you should always do it every year. It only takes a few minutes once you get used to it.]]I waxed all three drawers and the wood runners. I barely scratched the first of four bars in the package. At this rate, I figure I can get at least a year of use from my 1-pound box of Gulf Wax.Rating: Five stars.I found a great article online. ""How to Apply Paraffin to Sticky Drawers"" by Laura Reynolds of Demand Media offers these tips:1. Spread a few sheets of paper on a surface. Pull the drawer completely out of its case, and lay it on the papers. Check the edge of the drawer and the slides in the case to ensure that no splinters have formed along the drawer edges or wood trim that forms the slides. Lightly sand any rough edges -- even tiny splinters catch and grow larger as the drawer is forced open or closed.2. Warm a brick of canning paraffin at least to room temperature (70 degrees Fahrenheit). A warm brick will work into the pores of the wood more easily.3. Cut the brick in half or quarters if the drawer box is small, and wrap a piece of waxed paper around the end you will hold. The waxed paper provides a layer to protect against rough edges and splinters.4. Rub the end of the paraffin block along both edges at least six times on each. Do not exert pressure, just move the block along the edges; this way, the paraffin wax becomes embedded in the wood.5. Wax the drawer and its slides periodically -- perhaps every two or three months -- to keep drawer edges and runner surfaces lubricated and splinter-free.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L0QA0S5EKCMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PS6PY2#wasThisHelpful","R3L0QA0S5EKCMA","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After learning about the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle, I switched to a standing desk. I found an old, four-drawer desk once used for the production of a weekly newspaper. It is now a converted stand-up writing desk with a shiny, smooth lacquered finish. I love the desk and I'm adjusting to the switch of working from a standing position.One problem arose. My laptop keyboard and mouse wouldn't stay in place. As I typed, the keyboard would rattle and slide down the desk.A co-worker suggested I try Duck Brand Non-Adhesive Shelf Liner. It works better than I expected. My Logitech Optical TrackMan Mouse and Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 now stay in place. My keyboard is 11 inches wide, so the 12-inch wide material is a perfect fit. The liner is sticky, so much so that I have to hold the material down to lift the mouse from it. The liner left no residue on my desk.I used 30 inches of the material for a base beneath my ergonomic keyboard and mouse. I plan to change the liner as often as needed, since it will collect more dirt and dust than if it were stored in a drawer. That means I can replace my modified keyboard/mouse pad seven more times.  Getting eight pads for $8.99 is a good value.Rating: Five stars.UPDATE: I received a question from another Amazon customer regarding my mouse. The Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman features a large, finger-controlled trackball. A regular mouse would not work on the shelf liner but it is fantastic for trackballs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16ABRR2IF3SC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002AS9NAI#wasThisHelpful","R16ABRR2IF3SC1","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't shy away from hot and spicy foods. However, I eat them for the taste, not the effect. I didn't blink when offered a chance to sample Arriba! Fire Roasted Mexican Hot Red Salsa.I opened a jar and tried it over three different meals: a lunch of chicken nachos; a dinner of bean burritos; and a dinner of fish tacos. In each and every case, the salsa overpowered the dish. My sons, ages 11 and 9, also tried the salsa. (They have their own condiment bottles of sriracha.) They came to the same conclusion: the hot red salsa was too strong.Despite our experience, we are interested in trying Arriba! Fire Roasted Southwestern Medium Garlic & Cilantro Salsa next. We noted the ingredient list on the jar was simple and easy to pronounce: Tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, cilantro, onions, garlic, vinegar, carrots, salt, paprika extract, sesame oil and spices.I'm giving the salsa a three-star rating to reflect the quality ingredients and the open-roasted process, I just wasn't able to find a match that the salsa paired with instead of overpowered the meal.Rating: Three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ5RG6R14KROL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIVY3G6#wasThisHelpful","RQ5RG6R14KROL","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love food. I find the ingredients, preparations, styles and tastes fascinating. I can't help but drool a little when I thumb through the hundreds of marinade recipes.What I like about Marinades: The Quick-Fix Way to Turn Everyday Food Into Exceptional Fare is that the book is as comfortable in my lap for browsing as it is in my kitchen as a guide or on my coffee table as art. I tip my spatula to Harvard Common Press for taking author Lucy Vaserfirer's ingredients -- 19 chapters of cultural and ingredient-driven marinades -- and turning it into a full course experience.Whether you bend a corner, use sticky notes or whip out a highlighter, you'll find yourself adding recipes to your to-do list because there are so many that look delicious and are easier to prepare.

"I suppose having a pre-K teacher and two sons (ages 11 and 9) makes our household a perfect laboratory for reviewing pencil sharpeners. I once joked that our family uses so many pencils that we plant seedlings to ease our guilt.This is our third or, maybe fourth, pencil sharpener review for Amazon.What makes the Acme Westcott iPoint USB Pencil Sharpener unique is that it can be powered either by batteries (4 AA) or USB cable.What makes the Acme Westcott iPoint USB Pencil Sharpener frustrating is that it lacks the motor and blades -- the heft -- for anything but casual use. I opened a package of pencils and sharpened each one. The sharpener handled the first four with a steady but slow grind. Sharpening the rest was a catchy, chuck-and-pluck effort.I tried to think of a situation where I needed a portable sharpener, powered by either batteries or a USB cable. Maybe, it is designed for business travelers. Sure, but I'd carry a pack of pre-sharpened pencils in my briefcase. Maybe, it is designed for an office worker who doesn't have a nearby outlet. Sure, but that's all the more reason to occasionally get up from the desk and stretch your legs.Honestly, I don't want pencil shavings and dust anywhere near my keyboard and computer.I recommend two other pencil sharpeners, both of which can handle six different pencil sizes and provide shaving receptacles. 5 stars: X-ACTO SharpX Principal Electric Pencil Sharpener -- a 550cc blade motor in a 1.5-pound sharpener (8.8 x 6.1 x 8.8 inches; and 4 stars: Stanley Bostitch QuietSharp6 -- one pound (10.6 x 6.1 x 9 inches). For classroom use, I rated the SharpX Principal one star higher than the QuietSharp6.There's a rush to design USB connections to a lot of products. Some work (I've got a nifty USB powered fan) and some don't (the coffee warmer never got hot enough). The Acme Westcott iPoint USB Pencil Sharpener falls into the latter category. I would much rather plug a pencil sharpener into an electric outlet than use AA batteries and a USB cable.Rating: One star","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PZHAPC501MA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CL55JQM#wasThisHelpful","R1PZHAPC501MA3","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Admittedly, we fell into a Keurig rut. After a frenetic start of buying sampler packs, we dialed in our favorite 3-4 varieties available through the Subscribe & Save program. We eschewed the variety packs and holiday samplers that too often are sugar-coated substitutes for people who, apparently, prefer candy bars to coffee.Prior to tasting the Brooklyn Bean Roastery Variety Pack, we regularly bought San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser, Timothy's World Coffee Parisian Nights and Martinson Donut Shop Blend. We tend to favor darker roasts but, on occasion, prefer the lightness of breakfast/donut shop blends.The Brooklyn Bean Roastery Variety Pack is a delicious addition to our Keurig collection. We prepared these coffees using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. We enjoyed the French Roast, Columbian and `Fugheddaboutit' blends the most, although there wasn't a `bad' blend in the entire box.My wife especially enjoyed the flavored blends Maple Sleigh and Hazlenut.The cost is $18.70 with Amazon's Subscribe & Save program, which works out to a very reasonable 47 cents per cup. We plan to buy the Brooklyn Bean Roastery Variety Pack for a couple more months, until we've landed on the 2-3 blends we like best. Although, I wouldn't be surprised if my wife occasionally requests the Variety Pack again to enjoy more flavors.For a first-time Keurig owner or for an office environment (many palates to please!), I highly recommend the Brooklyn Bean Roastery Variety Pack.Rating: Five stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R139ST7CRIMYIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008I1XPKA#wasThisHelpful","R139ST7CRIMYIJ","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ah, the orange cap! The Original (Shoyu) Dressing is our second-most favorite after the Angelo Pietro Sesame & Miso Dressing. Shoyu is our go-to dressing when one of our friends blesses us with fresh fish.Angelo Pietro dressings are versatile as a marinade for seafood, pork, poultry, and beef as well as a dip blended with mayonnaise and as a dressing for vegetable dishes and pasta.Bottles retail for $6-7 and can occasionally be found on sale, two for $8-10. All of this means that the Amazon price with the Subscribe & Save option, currently $5.89 is reasonable. Now, a 9.3-ounce bottle of dressing might not sound like a good value at the price but this dressing is dabbed on rather than poured on foods.

He quickly learned that Japanese food lovers shared his passion for the flavors of Italy. One restaurant became two, then four, and within a few years, Murata was running a successful chain of over 60 Angelo Pietro restaurants throughout Japan.The hugely popular Angelo Pietro salad dressings began as a humble sideline to the pasta business.

""To keep our patrons happy, we created the idea of an Italian vinaigrette with Japanese flavors to accompany a small salad and vegetables as a start.  Customers loved it, but most importantly, children loved it."" As the story goes, parents noticed that children would eat their salads and vegetables - but only with Pietro's special dressing.After repeated requests from parents for dressing to take home to families, Mr. Murata began filling his empty wine bottles with salad dressing. He soon realized that he had a hit on his hands, something that would eventually become an even bigger success than his original restaurant concept.From these modest beginnings, Pietro Dressings have now become the best-selling soy dressings in Japan with more than 17 million bottles of dressing produced and sold each year.

"This is a hard book to review because fans of Elmore Leonard are likely to pick up regardless what I write. Author Charles Rzepka gets the delicious assignment of digging through Leonard's books and picking gems out of a well-stocked treasury. I'm not quite sure how the Leonard himself would have approved of the academic treatment (Rzepka can be a tad verbose at times), but I can't ignore the professor's enthusiasm for his subject.For readers unfamiliar with Elmore Leonard, I recommend instead a three-book set available on Kindle, Pronto, Riding the Rap, Fire in the Hole, which features Deputy Marshall Raylan Givens of Justified fame.My only complaint is that The Johns Hopkins University Press chose to publish the hardcover edition is a small, hard-to-read typeface.

"While I'm new to Peter Clines' Ex-series, I'm familiar with zombies, having watched the first three seasons of The Walking Dead, and I'm familiar with superheroes, having watched The Avengers, Thor and The Amazing Spider-Man.Now, I must confess this isn't my most traveled genre. It has been years since I read Neuromancer by William Gibson and A Scanner Darkly by Philip K. Dick. And while Ex-Purgatory doesn't rise to the same level as either of those hugely influential SF stories, it is a well-paced book with enough cultural references to keep me entertained (Seinfeld appears on page 161).George Bailey (The Mighty Dragon or St George) is an interesting antihero. His dreams of a zombie apocalypse are - no surprise here - more than just dreams. You'll see similarities to the Terminator storyline as the ""superheroes"" save humanity from zombies.

Even though Pinkbeard's Revenge (The Adventures of Jo Schmo) is the fourth book in the series, my son had no trouble enjoying the witty tale.I'm reluctant to give this a five-star rating as it is the book reading equivalent of chewing gum.

As you'll see in his video review, Kou offered a six-star review of The Sultan's Tigers even though I'm quite sure he knows a five-star rating is the ceiling.Kou enjoyed watching The Adventures Of Tintin, which features the salty Captain Haddock as the young boy's adventure mate.

"I like this case because it allows me to carry the Kindle in my backpack, along with books and other electronic devices, and not have to worry about scratching up the screen.Granted, it took a bit of origami-folding practice to get the hang of hands-free landscape or portrait viewing. My wife like to set it up in the kitchen while she's making dinner and either watch streaming videos or listen to music from our Amazon cloud.From reading the one-star and two-star reviews for the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9"" Standing Polyurethane Origami Case, I'm come to the conclusion that many people have unreasonable expectations. This is a tablet case, not a 100-and-1 multi-tool. But, if that is your expectation, here are the negatives.CONS* No airbags or parachute protection* Doesn't respond to thought control* Can't do income taxes* Won't make breakfast in bedThe other most common complaint is the weight, which comes from a combination of durable polyurethane, a microfiber interior and an integrated magnetic closure. I don't have an issue with the weight, which I perceive as durability.The case stays shut and keeps my screen clean. If that wasn't enough, there are two more excellent design features: (1) opening and closing the case wakes up the Kindle or puts it in sleep mode and (2) sliding the Kindle up in the case in landscape mode will trigger the rear camera for quick pictures.In summary, the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9"" Standing Polyurethane Origami Case is durable, versatile and well designed to provide added benefits beyond keeping the screen scratch-free and the overall Kindle protected from spills and minor drops.Rating: Five stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PRL85I3F8XFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DULMXTW#wasThisHelpful","R1PRL85I3F8XFD","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She said it took less than 20 minutes to unpack, read the instructions and set up the headset. The headset came with two rechargeable batteries, one charged inside the headset that could be used right away. The Li-Ion battery pack charges quickly.""The headset is very comfortable,"" my wife told me. ""I can wear it for a long time. The cushy earpieces don't hurt my ears.""She uses the SteelSeries H Wireless Headset to watch streaming video from Amazon and Netflix. My sons use the headset on their Xbox 360. Everyone reports that the sound quality is every bit as rich as you'd expect from Dolby virtual 7.1 surround sound technology.The styling is equally impressive with a matte black finish combined with a glossy finish on the cups.

"Fourth Down and Inches by Carla Killough McClafferty mines a hot topic - concussions - in the football world, cobbling a slight history, family pictures and heavy heart strings to fill less than 100 pages in an awkward, picture book format.I emphasize ""cobbled"" because the cover photo - of the NFL Washington Redskins - comes from iStockphoto, nearly a quarter of her source notes cite the New York Times, and only former New England Patriots fullback Kevin Turner is mentioned in the acknowledgments as an interview subject.The NFL isn't even cited in the index.The book starts with the Harvard football team in 1905 and lily-pads eighty years of the game's development to land again with brief mentions of Joe Theismann compound fracture and Ronnie Lott's amputated left pinkie. The narrative fluctuates between medical research on traumatic brain injury and anecdotal stories of high school players.The book's design is too slick for the seriousness of the subject. Adorned with a grass field border on the bottom of each page and a damaged, blurry typeface for chapter headings, the design is a garish hybrid of children's picture book and coffee table decoration. The brain trauma illustrations, and there are many, are flat and do little to complement the narrative. Worse yet are the gratuitous family photos of high school football players who suffered concussions and died. The pictures are too large, oddly cropped and give the book the feel of an obituary.I can't recommend this book, despite the subject matter. Held up next to League of Denial: The NFL, Concussions and the Battle for Truth, McClafferty's book pales in comparison. Her book lacks NFL sources and details that are at the forefront of the concussion issue, and is padded with photos, poetry and generalities like ""Football not only unites teams, it also unites the school and the community.""Rating: Two stars","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T3RQD1IIHJTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1467710679#wasThisHelpful","R3T3RQD1IIHJTD","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the account of Garrett Webster's testimony to a Senate Committee in 2007 about his father, Pittsburgh Steelers legend Mike Webster.""He asked if anyone in the room had any idea what it was like to shock one's father with a Taser to alleviate his pain; or if they had experienced receiving a desperate phone call from his dad, saying he was about to kill himself to escape the unending torture; or if they had watched a ""once-proud, strong man"" like Mike Webster beg for Kentucky Fried Chicken. But it was Garrett's story about how his father missed his tenth birthday without so much as a phone call -- a man who once called him practically every night before bed -- that left everyone in the room pondering the future of pro football.""I thought of my own father, a machinist by trade, ravaged by hot metal chips flying off a lathe that left his arms covered in scar tissue; the multiple back surgeries to repair damage caused by years of lifting cylinders into the chuck; his tinnitus, a permanent, high-pitched ringing that resulted from decades of industrial work during an era when no one understood or valued ear protection. His generation missed out on safety improvements and workplace protections commonplace today.A ""once-proud, strong man"" filled my memories and I cried.Webster died at the age of 50 in 2002. He earned four Super Bowl rings and played in nine Pro Bowls during his 17-year career. Webster was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1997, voted to the NFL's all-time team in 2000, and played in more games, 220, than any other player in Steelers history.However, it was the discovery of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in Webster's autopsy that could overshadow his on-field achievements. CTE was a condition never previously identified in football players. Webster's autopsy provided the first hard evidence linking football to permanent brain damage and, ultimately, the largest settlement in NFL history.League of Denial: The NFL, Concussions and the Battle for Truth details how, over two decades, the National Football League and, specifically, former commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who left office in 2006, and current commissioner Roger Goodell, covered up and denied a growing body of scientific research that revealed the connection between frequent, repetitive hits and brain damage.This book was released on Oct. 8, 2012, the same day the Frontline special, ""League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis"" premiered on PBS. The book excerpts appeared in Sports Illustrated and ESPN Magazine.How damaging is `League of Denial' to the NFL? Commissioner Roger Goodell launched spin control via his 10 million email address database a day after the excerpts from the book ran on ESPN.com and in Sports Illustrated. Goodell touted the NFL's increased safety efforts, including launching a new program called ""Heads Up Football,"" which is designed to ensure that coaches are trained and certified in proper tackling techniques as well as concussion and hydration education.The Fainaru brothers wrote:""The NFL's strategy seemed not unlike that of another powerful industry, the tobacco industry, which had responded to its own existential threat by underwriting questionable science through the creation of its own scientific research council and trying to silence anyone who contradicted it. There are many differences, but one is that football's health crisis featured not millions of anonymous victims but very public figures whose grotesque demises seemed almost impossible to reconcile with their personas. One eight-year NFL veteran would kill himself by drinking antifreeze. Another prominent player would crash his Ford pickup into a tanker truck while leading police on a high-speed chase. Two players, Dave Duerson and Junior Seau, would fire handguns into their chests; Seau used a .357 Magnum that his family didn't know he owned to shoot himself in a guest room of his beach house filled with the memorabilia of a legendary 20-year career. As the crisis grew, the brains of those famous players became valuable scientific commodities. A macabre race ensued among researchers to harvest and study them -- even while the bodies were still warm. Minutes after Seau's body was carted out of his house, his oldest son, Tyler, began getting calls seeking his father's brain.Nearly 6,000 retired players and families would ultimately sue the league and Riddell for negligence and fraud. Their argument was that the NFL had ""propagated its own industry-funded and falsified research"" to conceal the link between football and brain damage.One week before the start of the 2013 season, the NFL settled the case -- agreeing to pay the players $765 million, plus an expected $200 million in legal fees. The NFL did not admit wrongdoing, but the settlement hardly resolved the question at the core of the league's concussion crisis: How dangerous is football to one's brain? Unlike smoking, there was no scientific consensus about the risks of playing football.The NFL settlement - at three quarters of a billion dollars - is still roughly half what ESPN spends annually just for the rights to broadcast `Monday Night Football.' That might explain why ESPN recently cut ties with the Frontline investigation after 15 months of collaboration.One neurosurgeon connected to the NFL said children were more likely to sustain a brain injury riding a bike or falling down. Another neurosurgeon, also connected to the league, called for abolishing tackle football entirely for children younger than 14.""The mention of children brought the book home for me. I'm a father of two sons, ages 11 and 9. Would I allow my sons to play football? Aware of the long-term effects of concussions, would you?Rating: Five stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BM27451V3M72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770437540#wasThisHelpful","R2BM27451V3M72","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having the benefit of multiple perspectives - a preschool teacher (my wife) and two students (my sons, ages 11 and 9) - I felt confident that my five-star review of the 10 Minutes a Day: Math Grade 2 workbook was not unduly influenced by my desire to have my children excel in math.My sons are in the fourth and fifth grades, several years beyond the math level for which this workbook is designed. However, their ability to compare their second-grade math work to this workbook (published by DK Children), was insightful. They are far enough removed from the work to appreciate its presentation while being close enough to offer details that would escape adults. Here are three bullet points that capture their perspective:* Presentation matters: The workbook design is clean, airy and complemented with a balance of color illustrations. Each page is cut out to provide access to a bright orange 10-minute timer.* Instructions: My sons both commented on how the instructions for each math lesson are easy to read and easy to understand. The publisher uses a colored bar atop each page to highlight the instructions, which are never more than 20 words in length.* Timer: It is funny how such a novelty can motivate a young learner. Set a child down and instruct them to do math homework and the results vary. Set a child down with a stopwatch and see them rise to the challenge. Even though the work was relatively easy for my sons, they wanted to test themselves against the clock.In summary, as a parent who wants my children to excel, this workbook is a good investment. At less than $10 each, the workbooks are an affordable addition to classroom exercises.Rating: Five stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LKY7DCYS4JRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465402314#wasThisHelpful","R3LKY7DCYS4JRY","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Breakfast in my home has not been the same since my family has taken to making smoothies. They juice fresh carrots, spinach, celery, apples; blend in frozen blueberries, mango and cherries; and add wheat germ, flaxseeds, nut butters and yogurt.So, it should come as no surprise that the KRUPS Infinity Slow Juice Extractor sits on our kitchen counter like a stainless-steel Buddha, treasured and revered by the breakfast crowd. To be fair, the Krupps juicer isn't much larger than other juicing models (perhaps, a tad taller). Although, the stainless-steel finish is attractive enough to justify leaving it out on your counter if you have the space to spare.As for the juicer's performance, it does what it claims and it does it well. Clean up is still about five minutes, standard for counter-top juicers, to disassemble, wash and brush out the last bits of pulp from the basket. The Krupps juicer comes with two stainless steel baskets, a fine and coarser grid to accommodate everything from juice to sauces and smoothies.TIPS:* Read the manual. Additional instructions are on the company's website. This juicer uses an auger to compress the ingredients instead of chopping them up with blades.* Practice assembling and disassembling the juicer a couple times before you embark on your first adventure.* Cut your ingredients into smaller pieces. The feeder holes are smaller than what you'll find on other juicer models. Also, the auger handles some foods (e.g. spinach) differently than blade models. The results are better but you need to make some adjustments in your prep work.Finally, The parts are dishwasher safe, a feature that my wife greatly appreciated.

"Author Jeff Tapia's footnoted construction stands out among children's books for this age group. Tapia is swimming against the stream here. Most popular fiction for this age group is so saturated in illustrations as to push books into comic-book territory.The story in a nutshell: twins Jimmy and Stella restore the titular creation to save the town of Wymore. The book's humor is buried inside thick layers of diner slang and colloquial phrases and copious explanatory footnotes that occasionally break the fourth wall of entertainment.Tapia's footnotes reminded me of the challenge and struggle my sons had earlier this year with Margarita Engle's Mountain Dog, a book written in free verse. My advice to parents is to welcome more challenging reading experiences like this and encourage your children expand their reading experience beyond the angst-ridden middle school series -- the fast food of the children's publishing universe -- populating the book shelves.It wasn't long into reading Hippomobile! my son, Kai, was making comparisons to Ian Fleming's Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Daniel Pinkwater's Adventures of a Cat-Whiskered Girl, two other imaginative adventures designed for ages 9-12 (grades 4-7).In summary, the book is a silly adventure that occasionally needs more action, more humor and more adherence to a forward-moving plot.

Trying to be a mystery, a coming-of-age story, a wry comedy, the book ended up without a clear identity; the mishmash overwrought at times.In summary, I didn't care for the snarky tone or the Nickelodeon sense of humor.

"""Here's blood in the kitchen, there's blood in the hall:Here's blood in the parlor, where the lady did fall.False Lamkin shall be hung on the gallows so high,While his bones shall be burned in the fire close by.""Dark notes abound in Catherine Jinks' fantasy novel, the first in a trilogy set in Victorian London. What does the title mean? Bogle = monster. Catch = kill. However, a title of ""How to Kill a Monster"" isn't' as catchy.Designed for Harry Potter fans searching for a new fantasy fix, author Catherine Jinks presents Bogle-killing master Alfred Bunce and his 10-year old apprentice, Birdie McAdam. Birdie isn't so much a ""Go-Devil Man"" like Bunce as she is monster bait: her singing voice attracts monsters from dark places.Perhaps intentionally, Birdie reminds us of Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren and Harriet the Spy by Louise Fitzhugh. Of the three, How to Catch a Bogle is the darkest tale, so prepare accordingly. The monsters are only part of the East London menace. Birdie chooses Bogle hunting over the paupers' school, the workhouse, or living on the street, begging and stealing to survive.In addition to the Dickensian pot of social miseries, the prodigious Cockney accent and the interspersed English folk ballads together make this book a bit more of a challenge than most 9-year old readers tackle. Parents are advised to stay close, answer questions and allay concerns as they arise.Rating: Five stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MNWK4YEHPGT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544087089#wasThisHelpful","R1MNWK4YEHPGT6","A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"THE STORY OF WOMEN AND POWER is a BBC television three-part documentary written and presented by historian Amanda Vickery (THE STORY OF WOMEN AND ART), who teaches early modern history at Queen Mary University of London; shes an award-winning author who also reviews for The Guardian and BBC Radio. In this history, she considers the centuries-long struggle of women for their political and sexual equality.  Suffragists, as I prefer to call these brave women who struggled with society, their families, their husbands, rather than the more common, cutesy term suffragettes, endured many challenges in their fight for women's political influence. For many centuries, women were owned as chattel by their fathers/brothers/husbands, had no right to their own lands, money, children.  In this sweeping, often shocking series, Vickery tells the untold story of British women's battles in the centuries-old war of women vs. men.This illuminating documentary features the stories of some of the most notable women in British history. Vickery profiles key figures including Mary Wollstonecraft, the mother of feminism; Hannah More, who found ways for women to enter public life; suffragist  leader Emmeline Pankhurst; Queen Victoria, who had progressive views on womens rights. She discusses the tragedy of a suffragist who apparently committed suicide on the race course at the Epsom Derby, longtime social highlight of the year. She enlightens us on Margaret Thatcher, who , decades ago, served as the first female Prime Minister in the U.K. The historian shows us a museum piece, a frightening torture device for women deemed scolds by their husbands, which would restrict their ability to speak. She visits the Houses of Parliament, Queen Victoria's holiday home, and a livestock market where men once sold their wives at auction. (She tells us that ,over the years,  there are at least 300 documented cases of men selling their wives). And she converses frankly with other experts, among them current Member of Parliament Stella Creasy and the son of Nancy Astor, the first female member of parliament (MP).Vickery guides us through history, from an early march for women's rights in 1649 to a notorious incident in 1738, when the Duchess of Queensberry crashed the House of Lords, to the militant activities of the Edwardian suffragists, the modern-day campaigns that remind us the fight is not yet over. The DVD release coincides with the upcoming release of the new film SUFFRAGETTE that stars three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep as Emmeline Pankhurst, Cary Mulligan and Helena Bonham Carter. The presenter does limit herself to Great Britain, which I found a pity: Id have preferred information on parallel developments on the continent of Europe, and here in the United States.  Nevertheless,  the narrative is richly told; footage found, travel to places of unusual interest made across the country.  And the documentary has resonance beyond the British Isles. It also has subtitles, thank goodness, as Vickery moves and speaks swiftly. The boxed set , which I received as a review copy, consists of one single DVD, containing three episodes running approximately 180 mins. A lively, accurate, engaged history lesson that might open some eyes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NF1UGJ430QJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013RZBG7K#wasThisHelpful","R2NF1UGJ430QJV","A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MISS FISHERS MURDER MYSTERIES, Series Three. In this Australian television series, Essie Davis (THE SLAP, THE BABADOOK), stars as the title character, as she returns as Miss Phryne Fisher, a lady detective from Melbourne with a stylish  wardrobe, a sense of fun, a gold revolver and a flair for solving crimes. The entertainment, based on the novels of Kerry Greenwood, is set in the late 1920s: Australia is slowly recovering from  World War I. In what might perhaps best be described as an historic, light-hearted romantic comedy mystery series, Miss Fisher continues her unconventional antics, solving crimes with the help of her ensemble of household cohorts and the suave dedicated Detective Jack Robinson, (Nathan Page, THE SECRET LIFE OF US), with whom she shares a playful partnership.  Although she often outraces him to the crime scene. In the current costume series, which is being shown in the United States on select PBS stations in syndication, we watch as, despite Jacks efforts to keep matters on a professional level, their partnership grows  more personal. Phryne and Jacks developing relationship is matched by the on-again, off-again romance of Phrynes assistant, Dot Williams (Ashleigh Cummings, TOMORROW, WHEN THE WAR BEGAN), and Jacks constable, Hugh Collins (Hugo Johnstone-Burt, SAN ANDREAS). Also present to enjoy the fun is Phrynes Aunt Prudence (Aunt P), played by the highly-esteemed  veteran of stage and screen, award-winning actress Miriam Margolyes, who has achieved success on both sides of the Atlantic. (She won the 1993  BAFTA Best Supporting Actress award  for THE AGE OF INNOCENCE(1993);also won Best Supporting Actress at the 1989 LA Critics Circle Awards for her role in LITTLE DORRIT (1987).But Miss Fishers  estranged father, Lord Henry George Fisher, Henry, Baron of Richmond, arrives  unannounced after selling up the family estate in England. As Phrynes father does his best to ingratiate himself with her household: Dot, Bert, Cec and Mr. Butler, his roguish charm is lost on his own daughter. Phryne recalls a secret encounter that she witnessed during the War, between her father and the cousin from whom the Fishers inherited their title; she begins to suspect that her ancestor is still alive and could be out to exact his revenge.  Also, Phryne's Aunt Prudence takes on more than she bargained for when she opens her home to psychiatrist and natural healer, Hayden Samuels. And when Phryne hosts a tennis tournament to raise money for female tennis players, the practice partner of a rising tennis star is fatally bitten by a funnel-web spider, sparking a murder investigation that reveals one of Phryne's hidden fears.In 1920s Melbourne, Phryne (apparently pronounced Frinee) Fisher is a rather liberated, modern woman operating  in a male-dominated world. (It is also a world in which aborigines and ethnics are apparently invisibleor caricatured.) And just to get it off my chest, as the daughter of a baron, Phryne should be addressed as the Honourable Miss Fisher, or Lady Phryne, but apparently they dont do that in Australia, and whos counting.  At any rate, the Melbourne scenery is splendid in high-definition, the historic costumeswhich are outstanding, flappers galore,  interiors and modes of transport appear to be accurate for the period. The acting is uniformly fine. The plots are sharply written, smart and fresh; the dialog is witty as this female cross between the Saint and James Bond goes about her business. The episodes are:1.Death Defying Feats. Dot, Cec and Bert are having a night out, see the magic show The Mighty MacKenzie and the Cavalcade of Mysteries. First, the guillotine trick: the machine is tested on a cabbage head first, works fine.  Then it decapitates Miss Pearl, the magicians assistant and fiance.2.Murder and the Maiden.  Night time; outside the chain link fence surrounding the RAAF Victorian Command HQ, a desperate woman runs, crying for help. A figure catches up with her; gloved hands strangle her as we watch, horrified.3.Murder and the Mozzarella. A tenor sings La Donna e Mobile in the background; an elderly woman is attacked in an Italian restaurant kitchen.  Nonna Luisa, iron-fisted matriarch of the restaurant family, expires.4.Blood & Money. Paddy, a street kid, hires Phryne to find his missing brother Ned.  We discover two more members of their gang murdered; see that Phryne is really troubled by the loss of young lives.5 .Death & Hysteria.  Phyrnes Aunt Prudence feels indebted to Dr. Samuels, a psychiatrist who had helped her son, Arthur, before he died, and is also now trying to help her deal with her grief after the death. Samuels loses his office space; grateful Aunt P lets him temporarily set up his sanatorium for wealthy women, and their problems, in her mansion. The women have all been diagnosed with hysteria, a Freudian diagnosis  meaning they were sexually unsatisfied. This is an interesting episode, addressing the problems with womens sexuality that the medical establishment had trouble recognizing, much less attempting to ameliorate: an early medical vibrator is important to the plot.6 .Death at the Grand. On the rooftop of a hotel that has seen better days, a man begs for his life; his knife-wielding stalker snarls, Wheres the money? Failing to get the answer he wants, the assailant pushes the pleading man off the roof. Inspector Robinson calls Phryne to the crime scene. Not to consult with. But because the dead man was holding a satchel labeled: Property of Miss Phryne Fisher. Phyrnes father is involved.7.Game, Set & Murder.  Stanley Burrows, one of Phyrnes oldest friends, has married Constance, a tennis pro. Phyrne sponsors a fund-raising tournament; top players have arrived in Melbourne to participate. Theyre at Aunt Ps place, practicing on her tennis court. Theres a terrible accident. Player Bell Rosewell, Constances frequent partner, is bitten by a spider, one known to bite repeatedly to make it more dangerous, that lives only in moist dark vegetation, that  isnt native to Melbourne. Thats stuck in her shoe.8. Death Do Us Part. The backstory of Henry George Fisher, Baron of Richmond, is finally revealed. At a cost, including the death of Mr. Quentin Tode, recent winner of the Wren Institute of Science annual prize, found dead in his observatory, his eyes and hands glowing bright blue.The box series consists of a three disc set; eight episodes running approximately 448 minutes. Bonuses include: behind the scenes footage (35 mins.); character clips (7 mins.); Mr. Butlers Drink of the Week, (8 mins.).  And a behind-the-scenes photo gallery. Be aware, there is some violence, nudity and sexual situations, though they are not heavy.  Thank goodness, there are subtitles, for those of us not too familiar with Australian lingo.  I received this as a review copy.  Davis, whom we will soon see in next seasons GAME OF THRONES, makes a swashbuckling leading lady, who does always find her manor woman.  Shes entertaining as can be.  So is the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBKMA2BWI9UE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011T0C73W#wasThisHelpful","RBKMA2BWI9UE9","A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scarlet Women: The Scandalous Lives of Courtesans, Concubines, and Royal Mistresses, by Ian Graham.  The existence of courtesans, concubines and royal mistresses is a reflection of the fact that historically, throughout the world, marriages of royalty, nobility and even the wealthy were made for dynastic, family reasons, not love or even lust.  Powerful, rich men might well find themselves with wives who were unattractive, slow-witted, poorly educated, poorly dressed.  SCARLET WOMEN tells the stories of the most notorious courtesans, concubines and royal mistresses. Its contents range from the ancient world to the present day, from Europe and America to the Far East.Courtesans, you see, were an elite group of talented, professional mistresses, outstanding in beauty, wit, education, fashion sense, the most successful of whom became wealthy and famous in their own right.  They led charmed lives, enjoyed freedom and political power unknown  to most women of their time and place, but were ostracized by what once was known as polite society.  This book ranges from the hetaerae of ancient Greece to the cortigiani onesti of 16th century Venice, the oiran of Edo-period Japan to the demimondaines of 19th century France.  Concubines were secondary, subsidiary wives in societies where they were allowed; mistresses, of course, had but one lover.The extraordinary women featured in the book include:-Cora Pearl, who served herself naked on a platter at her legendary parties;-Harriette Wilson, who blackmailed her clients;-Clara Ward, an American woman who married a Belgian prince and then ran away with a gypsy violinist;-Klondike Kate, queen of the Yukon during the Klondike gold rush;-Veronica Franco, the leading sixteenth century Venetian courtesan;-Mesdames de Pompadour and du Barry, two of Louis XVs many mistresses;-Nell Gwyn, the saucy orange-seller who captivated British King Charles II;-Marie Walewska, Napoleon Bonapartes reluctant Polish mistress;-Cixi, a concubine who rose from obscurity to rule China;-La Belle Otero, last of the great European courtesans,a volcanic Spanish beauty. Her patrons included Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia. She accumulated an enormous fortune, but gambled it all away, died in obscure poverty;-Marie Duplessis inspired characters by both Dumas and Verdi;-Ninon de LEnclos, offered 50,000 crowns for one night by the wily, powerful royal advisor Cardinal Richelieu; money left in her will paid for the education of Voltaire, great 18th century French thinker.Ian Graham is a British author of popular science, technology and history books. He studied physics and journalism at university, worked as a magazine journalist before switching to authorship; he was a joint winner of the 2012 Royal Society Young People's Book Prize, was shortlisted for the 2014 Educational Writers' Award.  This book is written at the young adult level, but never mind, it is light, bright and breezy, a quick read.  Its emphasis does appear to be on the famous royal mistresses and courtesans of France.  The big question to my mind: wherever on earth are the pictures of these women, such as are available?  Dont tell me they were beautiful, show me!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29GB0MW7QHLS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250062632#wasThisHelpful","R29GB0MW7QHLS3","A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Thrse Raquin tells the dark story of a young woman (in the title role, Oscar-nominated Kate Nelligan, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES, THE PRINCE OF TIDES), bored with her restricted, mundane life and trapped in a marriage with her perennially ill, feebleminded and apparently impotent first cousin, Camille (Kenneth Cranham, MALEFICENT). The BBC three part television serial originally debuted in 1981; in the United States, it was shown on Masterpiece Theatre. A historical costume drama, it is based on the classic 1867 scandalous novel and play by famous French author mile Zola: it was shot on gritty Parisian streets and in the idyllic countryside. In it, Camille brings home their childhood friend, Laurent (Brian Cox, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, BRAVEHEART). (The three young people had shared an achingly free childhood on the river).Once remet, the romantic chemistry between Thrse and Laurent is instantaneous: they begin an affair. The strong  ensemble cast garnered wide acclaim for their performances, with Nelligan hailed as electrifying and Cox as superb (Daily Express, UK), in this BAFTA Award-winning miniseries also starring Alan Rickman (SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, DIE HARD, Harry Potter films) and Mona Washbourne (MY FAIR LADY).  This classic, star-studded tale, made in the days when the BBC really knew how to make historic costume dramas, has been released to coincide with a new Broadway adaptation of the play starring  Keira Knightley and Judith Light.The Canadian-born Nelligan had been tipped to be a major star, which never happened, but shes superb here, carrying the production with extraordinary power and sensuality.  And her performance does shoot sparks in a production that cannot be called cheerful. (Personally, I am surprised that no grand opera was ever made based on this material; it has all the ingredients.) Direction was by the noted Simon Langton. Photography is evocative, though, perhaps too evocative for some, as the streets of Paris, the city of light, have never looked more drab and gray. The riverside scenes, however, are simply dreamy. Of course, costuming, interiors and dialog are appropriate to the age: this is a BBC production, after all. Unfortunately, the age of the original material means that it could not always be updated perfectly for this release. I received this as a review copy. The box set contains one DVD on which are all three episodes, totaling approximately 166 minutes. With subtitles, thank goodness.This dark, rather slow-moving tale of forbidden love will not be everyones cup of tea  and how the French do drink tea in this production.  Nevertheless, it has grandeur, and is powerful, with some hot-blooded sex scenes. I loved it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R8FZ7D1HR49R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKX6V68#wasThisHelpful","R2R8FZ7D1HR49R","A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iron House, (2012), by  North Carolina author and former criminal defense attorney John Hart. This thriller follows on the heels of the New York Times bestselling crime novels THE KING OF LIES, DOWN RIVER, and THE LAST CHILD. Hart is the only author in history to win the best novel Edgar Award for consecutive novels; he has also won the Barry Award and England's Steel Dagger Award for best thriller of the year. His books, to date, all of which I have reviewed and loved, have been set in North Carolina: generally the mountainous west of the state.As his earlier works, IRON HOUSE is centered on families, stressed and in danger, several of them in this complex, multilevel work.  At its heart are Julian and Michael, who are apparently orphans, marooned at the Iron Mountain Home for Boys, where there was nothing but time. Enough for them to learn that life is not easy. Julian, physically and mentally weak,  survives only because his bigger older brother, Michael, is both feared and fiercely protective. When Julian brutally kills an older bully,  Michael takes the rap to protect his brother,  flees the orphanage in a snow storm. For two decades, he does well on the streets of New York, eventually making a bountiful living as a mob enforcer for Otto Kaitlin. But this life begins to unravel when he meets Elana, who knows nothing of his past. Michael now wants a fresh start, the chance to build a family of his own. But organized crime does not allow for retirement. As a hunted man, everyone he loves at risk, Michael carries Elena back to North Carolina, to the side of the brother he'd lost so long ago.Harts books have been translated into twenty-nine languages and can be found in over fifty countries. He has worked as a banker, stockbroker, and apprentice helicopter mechanic. Now a husband and father of two, he spends his time in North Carolina and Virginia. I saw him speak as a younger man, several years ago, at a mystery festival sponsored by the local Wilmington, N.C. library.  He was, of course, intelligent, well-spoken, with a fair amount of wit.  As in his earlier works, the author does a fine job of giving us the geography, flora, fauna, roads and transportation, social peculiarities of  North Carolina and neighboring states.  And New York too.  His narrative and descriptive are crisp, his dialog cuts.  The suspenseful plot sucks you in from the first page, and, despite the writers literate broodings on the nature of family, doesnt let up to the last.  There are touches of Southern Gothic-- greatly exaggerated characters -- to be sure, again as in his previous novelsin a pair of very nasty mothers.  This book is certainly more violent than his earlier works, with a much higher body count  in fact, a very high  and bloody body count.  I dont mind that, but, if you do, beware.  Its entirely possible that this book is more commercially-oriented than its predecessors.  Who cares.  Not me.  I love it, as I did his earlier works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I3VAXQZ2WD87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250007011#wasThisHelpful","R1I3VAXQZ2WD87","A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"LOUISES WAR, (2011), by award-winning North Carolina author Sarah Shaber, is first in her popular historical  mystery series: it stars, and is narrated by, Louise Pearlie, a young widow working for the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, DC, during World War II.  It follows on the heels of the writers well-known Simon Shaw series.It's 1942.  Louise Pearlie, a young widow, has left her familys fish camp in coastal Wilmington, North Carolina; come to Washington DC to work as a clerk for the legendary Wild Bill Donovans Office of Strategic Services, precursor to the CIA.  She is employed in the Research and Analysis Branch, discovers a document concerning the husband of her dear college friend Rachel Bloch-a young French Jewish woman Louise is desperately worried about; realizes she may be able to help Rachel escape from Vichy France just ahead of the Gestapo with its plans to send all French Jews to concentration camps. Rachels husband, Gerald Bloch, is a hydrography expert on the coastline of French North Africa; he has knowledge critical for the soon-to-come Allied invasion of that continent.  Accordingly, the man has requested asylum for his Jewish wife and child while he joins the Resistance to fight the Nazis.  Louise  takes the Bloch file to her supervisor. Who is found dead in his ransacked office-- the file missing.Louise resolves to find the file, get it to Gen. Donovan, have him initiate plans to bring Rachel to the States. But it's difficult for Louise to know whom to trust. She fends off several would-be suitors who may be Vichy supporters. One of them takes her to a party  at a posh mansion, home of famous Washington based hostess/heiress Evalyn McLain, where the file clerk chats with Clark Gable. Louise frets over FBI agents staking out her boarding house, breaks into the French embassy for more information on Gerald Bloch. She's confused about her fellow boarder, the Czech Joe Prager, who may or may not actually be a professor of Slavic languages.Is this crime drama chick lit?  Without a doubt, set in the classical world of white-glove wearing women and their concerns, with no onscreen blood, violence, sex, profanity. I have not been previously familiar with the authors work, although I believe I may once have seen her speak at a meeting of my local Wilmington, N.C.-based, mystery book club.  But reviewers familiar with the writers Simon Shaw series say that, while the Louise books are still best described as light-in-tone cozies, they are less so than Shaber's Simon Shaw series. LOUISES WAR  has been followed by LOUISE'S GAMBLE, LOUISE'S DILEMMA, LOUISES BLUNDER and LOUISES CHANCE.  The authors Professor Simon Shaw murder mysteries are now available as eBooks. She's also the author of a stand-alone horror novel, BLOOD TEST, and editor of TAR HEEL DEAD, a collection of short stories by North Carolina mystery writers. Anyone familiar with my work as a reviewer will know that chick-lit cozies are not my cuppa; I prefer darker work, and dont mind sex, violence and profanity at all. Still, this book does illustrate just how narrow minded 1940s society was, with women expected to wear hats and stockings, accept lesser, lesser-paying jobs, get coffee for their bosses; homosexuals to hide their preferences, people of color to accept job discrimination. And, as a 10-year resident of Wilmington, N.C. I enjoyed the authors portrait of the earlier city, and its popular, plentiful  smelly--fish camps.  It gets an extra star for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OYYGHK7N6X6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1622680723#wasThisHelpful","R2OYYGHK7N6X6G","A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CHASING SHADOWS.  This British television series by ITV is akin to detective dramas with currently fashionable flawed detectives, brilliant at their work but socially inept heroes like Bones, Monk and Sherlock. In this current day, London-set police procedural, DS Sean Stone (Reece Shearsmith, THE WIDOWER, THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN) possesses an uncanny knack for seeing patterns where others dont, getting inside the minds of serial killers. His ability makes him a brilliant detective, but hes hindered by a personality disorder that rubs colleagues the wrong way. Following a workplace blunder-- Stone embarrasses his chief at the Metropolitan police force, (the Met), at a news  conference. A conference meant to celebrate the MetsStones  successful solving of a case.  The detective  is demoted from the homicide division to the Missing Persons Bureau, seconded for life, where hes forced to team up with his polar opposite: warm, empathetic analyst Ruth Hattersley (Alex Kingston, ER, DOCTOR WHO,UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS).  This four-part British mystery series, which I received as a review copy, also stars Noel Clarke (STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS, DOCTOR WHO) as DI Carl Prior, Stones police counterpart.  It comes as a two disc set containing four episodes, running approximately 183 minutes. With subtitles, thank goodness, for those of us not up-to-date with London slang.The intense, socially awkward Stone and Hattersley, mismatched partners, clash from the start. Nevertheless, Stone dives headfirst into the bureaus massive database  as many as 300,000 people go missing in the United Kingdom every year -- to spot signs of serial killers behind some cases. Did the lonely teenage girl who posted on a suicide message board kill herself? Why did a lawyer and devoted family man disappear? To find the missing,  and protect societys most vulnerable from the evil that may stalk them, Stone will have to reckon with his own personality flaws before they destroy his career; harness Hattersleys talents. Also starring Don Warrington as the chief, the very same role he plays in MURDER IN PARADISE; Alfie Field (THE WOMAN IN BLACK).  Guest starring the mega talented Susan Lynch, a North Ireland-born actress who seems to have worked without stop since her debut in THE COMMITMENTS, going on to such as CRACKER, WAKING NED DEVINE, ELIZABETH:THE GOLDEN AGE. This dark, sophisticated crime drama features smart scripts, strong performances.  And has no onscreen sex, profanity, or violence. The episodes are:1. Only Connect, Part 1. After publicly criticizing police procedure upon the eventual capture of a serial killer, DS Sean Stone, who seems never to take off his raincoat, is sent to the Missing Persons Bureau. There he begins to track Leanne, possible multiple murderer  the usage Stone prefers -- of vulnerable teenagers.2. Only Connect, Pt. 2. In trying to track Leanne, Sean and Prior arrive at an eerie disused shopping mall, to find Ruth, whod gone to meet Leanne, with a bad head wound. Prior's concerned  about Ruth's injury; Sean's more concerned about whether she got a clear look at Leanne.3. Off Radar, Pt. 1. Sean, sorting through the deluge of missing persons cases coming into the office, singles out one that doesn't seem to fit the normal categories. And if there's one thing Sean finds more interesting than someone who fits a pattern, it's someone who doesnt.4. Off Radar, Pt. 2.  A convicted multiple murderer who is being kept in a secure mental hospital dies: police brass want to bury the whole affair and move on. But Sean's not so sure.  This episode ends on a cliffhanger; in this house we  sure hope  therell be a second series.CHASING SHADOWS is well-written, with tight scripts, good dialogue, appropriate chat in the cop shops. Uniformly good acting.  Its well photographed.  And it gives us the highs and lows of its world: striking views of London, an immensely impressive imperial city, also views of abandoned factories, malls: its gritty to the taste.  And witty. The entertainment is quietly funny, warm in its presentation of people who are concerned about each other. While still keeping the viewer glued to the edge of his/her seat.  Another binge-watcher in this house, we gobbled up its four episodes","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26XDGH2UGTS8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011T0C502#wasThisHelpful","R26XDGH2UGTS8S","A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Wild West with Ray Mears.  In this BBC television presentation, wilderness skills expert and TV presenter Ray Mears takes viewers across North America on a journey back in time to the Wild West.  He follows in the footsteps of the intrepid would-be settlers, who set out to conquer the west-- and discovered a frontier that wouldnt easily surrender .This two-disc boxed set, which I received as a review copy, gives us eight episodes that run approximately 204 minutes, with subtitles, though the sound throughout is pretty clear. Also, a 16 page viewers guide with map of settlers routes west, articles on stagecoach services, how the west was wild, pioneering womens right to vote, little-known facts about cowboys, and Geronimos art of war.  Also, profiles of interesting women of the west. The series is currently syndicated to public television stations through APT.Long before superhighways spanned North America, (right here in Wilmington, North Carolina, home to the Great Smoky chain of the Appalachians, U.S. 40, after more or less running into the Atlantic Ocean, then begins officially.  With a sign that says  if it hasnt been stolen againBarstow, California, 3225 miles.) But, back then, of course, westbound settlers lumbered across a dangerous continent by covered wagon or on foot. In this documentary, survivalist Mears retraces the steps of the 19th-century travelers and discovers how the trip's rugged terrain and deadly hazards affected and tested the pioneers.  He takes viewers across the seemingly impassable mountain ranges, sprawling grasslands, and arid deserts that confronted those, from North America, Europe and the British Isles, and Asia, who made the journey.Along the way, from the densely forested Appalachians  he gives us a good interval showing the beauty of this old mountain range, and interviews Cherokee tribal elder Davy Arch--to the windswept peaks of the Sierra Nevada, Mears ventures into parts of America that remain untamed to this day.  He shows us settlers sod houses on the prairie; the route taken by the infamous Donner Party, which was forced to descend into cannibalism while being trapped  in the Rockies for a very long winter that didnt end until April.  And the Navajo Indians, agricultural dwellers of the Great Plains, and their close relationship with its Buffalo; also the Blackfoot tribe. The impact of railroads on the settlement of the west. A fascinating few minutes on how a local, riding a sure-footed formerly wild Maverick horse on Utahs Angel Trail, part of the outlaws escape route, is able to carefully navigate loose rock and dust down into a crater that would have sent a chasing posse home pronto.  Also, Tombstone, one of the most famous Western towns, with its daily recreated fight at OK corral.  And he discusses the warrior Apache tribe, particularly its famous leader Geronimo, and his methods of war. Finally, he pans for gold in California.The episodes are: The First Settlers, Furs and the Mountain Men, the Wagon Trains, Homesteaders and Cowboys, Plains Indians and Buffalo, Gold and the Boomtowns, Bandits and Lawlessness, The Desert Indians. I found this series fresh, interesting and informative: it should appeal to fans of history, or those who are interested in nature survival.  It can clearly be helpful in schools; or more than that, where any group of children  or adultsis regularly gathered for learning/entertainment purposes. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H5KEZT7ZW9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKX6VYA#wasThisHelpful","R1H5KEZT7ZW9D","A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TULIP FEVER is a finely imagined, thoroughly researched international bestseller by the London-based Deborah Moggach, a well-known British TV writer and prolific novelist who also authored THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL, upon which the recent hit film of the same name is based. This novel, which was optioned by Steven Spielberg, is set in an absorbing time and place: 1630s Amsterdam, Holland.  As were such recent books as Susan Vreeland's GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE and Tracy Chevalier's GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING.  Of course, early 17th century Amsterdam has been forever immortalized by the serene, precise domestic realism of the canvases of Vermeer and Rembrandt.  But this historical fiction is a thought-provoking story not just of the societys contemporary art; also of beauty, lust, greed, deception and retribution -- set in a hard-working, otherwise responsible, refined society ablaze with tulip fever.In this romantic drama, we  meet wealthy elderly merchant Cornelis Sandvoort,  his young , dutiful, lovely  and bored wife, Sophia, whom he hopes will bring him the joy that not even his considerable fortune can buy: a child, praises be a son, to grant them immortality.  As so far the burgher and Sophia have failed to produce an heir, in a bid for a different sort of immortality, the businessman commissions a portrait of himself and his wife by the talented young Rembrandt-influenced, real-life artist Jan van Loos. However, as surely as Van Loos begins to capture Sophia's physical likeness on canvas, a slow passion begins to burn between the beautiful young woman and the talented artist.  The portrait is fleshed out,  the household's inhabitants enter a wrenching period of change, as ambitions, desires, and dreams breed deception, the lies multiply. Meanwhile, in the society at large, frenzied by tulip fever, immense sums  are being spent on the latest hybrids: a single Semper Augustus bulb sells  for ""six fine horses, three oxheads of wine, a dozen sheep, two dozen silver goblets and a seascape by Esaias van de Velde.""The author enriches her tight, taut novel with period detail. The Amsterdam of the period is brought almost physically alive.  Characters are each given their hours in the rare sun of the city.  Chapters are brief, each told from various characters points of view, Sophias in the first person.  The chapter headings from contemporary 17th century Dutch sources are on point and often charming, as they quote contemporary views of morals.  Her language is clear and witty: her dry humor underlies even the most tumultuous scenes of the novel. And the plot is exciting, as the  two pairs of lovers, Sophia and Jan, and the merchants servant Maria and her lover Willem, run through a series of improbable adventures while they struggle to make their way in the citys overheated air.I have not been previously familiar with this authors output, though I was marginally aware that she authored the, I expect richly charming novel upon which BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL is based.  However, I absolutely loved this book, and will be looking for more of Moggachs work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PIMMK95NT86J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385334923#wasThisHelpful","R1PIMMK95NT86J","A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Death of an Artist: A Mystery, by Kate Wilhelm.  This standalone crime novel is by award-winning author Kate Wilhelm, author of more than 30 novels including WHEN LATE THE SWEET BIRDS SANG; best known for her Barbara Holloway legal thrillers, most recently HEAVEN IS HIGH.  In this thriller, the Eugene, Oregon-based writer, gives us a small Oregon  coastal town, a seasonal resort, near Portland,  that is the scene of a case of art fraud, and murder.Silver Bay, Oregon with nearly a thousand year-round residents, is home to three generations of women: grandmother Marnie, long-widowed owner of a small gift shop; granddaughter Van, who is about to graduate medical school and begin her Chicago internship; and middle-generation mother  to Van, Stef, mercurial, difficult,  a brilliant artist who runs through men, refuses to sell her work. When Stef discovers that Dale Oliver-- latest husband/paramour in a long line--is trying to sell her work behind her back, she puts a stop to it and threatens to do the same to him. Shortly thereafter, Stef dies in an apparent accident in her studio; Dale shows up with a signed contract granting him the right to sell her work. Except that Stef had deliberately misspelled both her first and last names: shed evidently thought  shed  fix his wagon.  Marnie and Van are convinced that Dale murdered Stef in order to steal her artwork, decide to do whatever  they can to see that Dale doesn't get away with it,  including seeking  the help of the new stranger in town, Tony Mauricio,  former New York City cop, who is seemingly  the only person who can prove the death was murder.Well, having spent several years living in a small, seasonal coastal resort, I have a soft spot for them, but this one isnt well-drawn.  Neither is Portland, or the general area. Neither are the characters, who are cut from cardboard, predictable.  Neither, unfortunately, is the plot, which is linear, predictable: we always know the murderer and his motive, and soon enough, his method is given us, though Wilhelm seems to think we need further explanation of it. However, I've been reading this with my Carolina Beach mystery book club, and  it is a quick, easy entertainment, might do well as a beach read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NV8A1ZLLJ5M7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FU849M#wasThisHelpful","R2NV8A1ZLLJ5M7","A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Skin should be clean and dry before application. Apply Babe Eyelash Serum to the skin right above your upper lash line. Use a single brush stroke for each eye. Avoid rubbing your eyes until the serum has dried. When you are satisfied with the results, continue using Babe Eyelash Serum two to three times a week to maintain long lashes.As a younger woman, I had a 25-year long nervous habit of pulling out my eyelashes; my lids were usually bare.

"Blonde Faith (Easy Rawlins Book 11), is by Walter Mosley, prolific veteran New York Times and international bestselling author of crime fiction and science fiction, who is best known for this Easy Rawlins Los Angeles-set series, in which this is the eleventh. Mosleys debut crime novel in this thriller series, the set in LA, in the immediate post-World War II years, DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS, introduced us to Easy, an angry black World War II veteran, scuffling to make a living.  The book was a critically widely praised, surprise best seller which was filmed under the same title, DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS, starring Denzel Washington.  But the clock has ticked on since then; in real time, this book was published 17 years after Mosleys debut; in fictional time, we are now in 1967.  A middle-aged Easy Rawlins, who narrates, comes home from work one day to find Easter, daughter of his friend Christmas Black, left on his doorstep. Easy knows that this could only mean that former marine Black is in trouble, and in the wind. Then Easy finds that his lifelong friend Raymond Alexander (Mouse), who has also disappeared, is wanted for the murder of a father of 12.  And Easy has his own problems: Bonnie Shay, love of his life, is about to marry another man, an African prince. As Easy searches for these two very dangerous friends; two MPs who dont feel quite right insist on  hiring him to find Black for the U.S. Army. Easy's investigation brings him to Faith Laneer, a beautiful blonde with a questionable past.Mosley is one of America's most  acclaimed, popular writers; his books have won numerous awards and have been translated into more than twenty languages.  In addition to the celebrated Easy Rawlins  series, he is author of  the Fearless Jones series, and two collections of stories featuring Socrates Fortlow,  for which he received the Anisfield-Wolf Award. The native Angeleno now lives in New York City, Brooklyn, to be precise. The writers father, like his character Easy, was an LA school janitor; his mother was a Jewish World War II Holocaust survivor.  Although racially mixed marriages were legal in Los Angeles at the time, his parents were, for a while, unable to find anyone to marry them.  The Irish novelist Edna OBrien commented, as she taught him in a New York City College writing course that with his mixed black/Jewish background, Mosley was well-placed to have an outsiders view of America.  And nobodys books have commented more  sharply and descriptively on black life in America after World War II.  Further, Mosley is able, as always, to capture  his hometown in its climate, social mores, byways and highways, with absolute brilliance.  He is also well able, as ever, to keep his books moving with the times. His dialog is fine, as ever, even the black dialect. The plot is convoluted as ever, perhaps this time, somewhat melodramatic; there are, as ever, almost too many characters.Unfortunately, BLONDE FAITH  shows the Easy series age in many ways: it is filled with melancholy and regret, has the feeling that it may be the last of the Easy books, and for several years, it was.  Now, I have loved the authors work dearly, read every novel in turn up until CINNAMON KISS , the one before this,  and this one.  I am just getting back to these two now; and can see why Mosley and I stopped back then.  I have reviewed in these pages Mosleys Easy novels DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS, LITTLE GREEN and ROSE GOLD, and his free-standing ALL I DID WAS SHOOT MY MAN.  Mosley is always worth reading, but this series began with a bang with DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS and petered out with a whimper with CINNAMON and BLONDE. Until  the author was ready to come back to Easy with LITTLE GREEN  and ROSE GOLD.  Best to begin at the beginning with BLUE DRESS, see how it goes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ZHNKOIOM6F7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SEVCLE#wasThisHelpful","R26ZHNKOIOM6F7","A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't like ugly shoes, but I simply cannot wear uncomfortable shoes now that I am getting closer to the ""when I am an old woman I shall wear purple"" days. This puts me on a constant search for shoes and boots that manage to combine the two. These shoes are at the top of my list right now. I own several pairs of Fly London shoes. I have found that in general, it pays to go down a size in this brand. That being said, this shoe is the most comfortable of the lot, and perhaps more comfortable than any other pair I own, including some Jambu and Dansko shoes that I treasure for style and comfort. They are a bit odd looking. I have them in black and even though they go with everything, I am longing to buy them in a softer color because the style looks sort of stark in the black. Laced up, they hug your feet perfectly. The wedge heel gives nice height and shape to your leg, but without the pain of a pump. I paid more for these shoes than I  normally want to pay, but I am satisfied that I got my money's worth!

Even though they looked so totally plastic and fake, I still took them out to my garden beds, figuring I would use them for one season and replace them next year. However, the stake that is affixed to each hollow, plastic fake brick is less than 2"" long and about the size and diameter of a plastic toothpick you get at a cheap steakhouse. I pushed it into the ground and sat and stared at it for about one minute, before boxing everything back up and sending it back. There is no way those things were going to stay in the ground!

"I finally settled on these boots after buying and returning so many pairs of black boots that I thought Amazon might discontinue their free returns policy. There were other boots that were very close, but one little problem or another made me continue my quest for the perfect pair. I have an average size calf, and some boots were too tight in the calf (enzo angiolini deanja), others too loose and caused the pirate look (Keen Akita) others had such rugged soles I felt bad keeping them on indoors (corso como womens gage), others fit in the calves but bagged and irritated me in the ankle (steve madden jaden). These are leather in the front but the entire back is made out of a ribbed stretchy material so they can fit a good variety of legs to perfection. Some people might not like having the material in the back, but I found it made the boots comfortable, and at the same time gave the shape of my leg definition, which is nice since I have athletic calves but a smaller ankle. The buckle detail is pretty, and not as clunky and over the top as some of the boot hardware these days. It has been quite a snowy and cold winter in Michigan this year and I have been so happy to have a great pair of boots I can pull on every single day and look dressed up, but also go from indoors to outdoors without fear. I found these amazing fleece tights and leggings here on amazon and I have given up on pants because they are so much warmer and more comfortable than pants!

"I got these noodles to make my own version of low carb mac and cheese lottie and doof style (don't ask, just google it. now.). The recipe came out as delicious as if I had used regular pasta. The noodles are not tough or chewy like some lower carb pastas. When you have something as yummy as this mac and cheese around, it is pretty hard to do portion control and yet it did not seem to rock the boat too bad in terms of my weight loss program. I do not track blood sugars, so I cannot comment on that. I served this to several people who were not doing low carb and they gobbled it up without question. Nice to have a few dishes in my repertoire when I need to break (anything but) bread with my non LC friends! I have a sensitive stomach at times when it comes to low carb products, but the dreamfields line does not give me any trouble. I like the angel hair spaghetti and the lasagne as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18C6L58BKWVK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YN7VEW#wasThisHelpful","R18C6L58BKWVK2","A1JTQCIL88W9JV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTQCIL88W9JV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Based on another review I ordered a large in the ivory, even though I normally wear a small. I think this sweater is designed to look like you are bursting out of it like the girl in the photo. The large is snug on me (5'4"", #130) and there is significant button gaping at the bust (sexy?) and waist (definitely NOT sexy). There are also problems with the stitching along the seams of the button row. The sweater is ivory but there are bits of grey thread peeking out intermittently along the front seams. Given these problems, the price was so reasonable I am going to just keep it for an extra sweater to keep in my office to ward off the chill. I may be able to rinse it and block it to fit better.

"These boots satisfied every requirement of mine (look good with dresses, fit under slacks, not too high, no hardware or buckles at the top, side zip, stretch to the leg.

"I tried Miracle Noodles when I first started trying to reduce carbs in my diet, about 7 years ago. My experience was not good at all. The fishy odor and rubbery texture of the noodles could not be overcome and after several attempts, I threw out a large quantity of packages. Since then I have been wary, but I kept seeing posts and suggestions from other low carbers and decided to give these one last try. I made two changes in preparation methods and now I can say these are most certainly edible for me, which is great. I googled ""dry fry miracle noodles"" and found lots of suggestions. One I read said to rinse the noodles well, drain well, snip them up into smaller pieces with scissors, then dump them into a nonstick pan and gently tossing for about 8 minutes. This sounded like a long time to me, but the noodles didn't seem to crisp up or burn in the process. I turned the heat way down then added salt, then a giant whop of pesto, tossed in some walnut pieces and shaved parmesan and let it sit for another minute. Slid it onto a plate and it looked beautiful, did not smell of fish, and filled me up completely. The dry frying seemed to eliminate some of the intolerable odor for me, and snipping them up reduced the chance that a noodle would get semi-swallowed and stuck with one end down my throat and the other in my mouth. That sensation about killed me when I tried them way back when. The texture is still a bit rubbery, but I found them very satisfying. Glad I tried again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17TPVM09KIRNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CD9WWW0#wasThisHelpful","R17TPVM09KIRNW","A1JTQCIL88W9JV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTQCIL88W9JV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Every task needs the right tool for the job. A hiking backpack is made to fill up, be as light as possible, have some accessible pockets but mostly be about getting to a certain place and then unloading.  For hunting or other task oriented adventures, a different type of pack is needed, one that offers maximum accessibility and convenience, with a wide range of carrying options.This bag fulfills the latter role perfectly. It's not light, but it is comfortable and carries well. The best thing is that this has a crazy amount of storage options almost all of which are immediately accessible.  No need to dig into a large compartment, pulling out everything to find one thing.  With good organization, this bag is an immense time saver, allowing for everything in its place, when you need it as easy as possible.  It's designed for hunting but its use excels beyond that task. Great for photography or anything that requires a fair amount of accessories.  I even can see bringing this when hiking along with my young kids, with easy accessed compartments providing quick response to mood swings or needs.Perfect for what it's made for and very useful for all sorts of additional reasons, this really is going to get a lot of use.

"I'll admit, I've been a bit reluctant to the whole Princess obsession.  Our 3 year old daughter has a lot of other interests, and loves playing outside, so I had thought maybe we could avoid it. She loves Doc McStuffins and Sheriff Callie and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, which I think are much more fun and much better role models.  We even went to Disneyland this past March without her really obsessing over the princess stuff (which helped make the visit much more fun for the whole family).  But, she has cousins, and watching Disney jr brings the commercials. She's not obsessed yet, but definitely likes princess items, and increasingly so.  She's starting to get into Frozen, and, well, I am a sucker for that look of delight on her face.There's a lot of accessories out there, an endless amount, but for your money and space, this is the one to go with.  It's not cheap and it's certainly not small, but its really the perfect accessory to get an imagination going.  It comes effects (lights and a transforming stairs) all sorts of accessories, and otherwise really captures the grandeur of the movie (which I liked).  All in all, a wonderfully designed product that captures the scene as well as a toy can.

"I'm a novice with flying these, so I'm reviewing from that perspective.First of all, I had a very negative impression when I first opened it and tried to get it out of the box.  It's secured with very small and tight zip ties, which are connecting this vehicle by its very thin plastic cage to the very thin plastic mount.  I accidentally sliced one of the support bars in taking it out.  With this, I was flummoxed by not having a stand inside the box.  Then I realized the very cheap and thin packaging plastic it's on in the box is the ""stand"".  For a toy like this, pay a bit more for some higher quality and more secure plastic if you're going to call it a stand!  I had no idea they were passing this off as the stand, so I cut through it in order to better get as those horrible twist ties.Once out of the box, however, it gets better.  The controller (looks like an X-Box controller) needs batteries, but it comes with a tiny screwdriver (I'd prefer to have a stand instead of a screwdriver) to open it up.  Getting the battery in the vehicle isn't very intuitive, and the instructions are a fair bit out of order, telling you how to control it first, with you having to dig farther in to find it tells a bit about setup.That bother out of the way, this becomes fun.  The instructions to fly are helpful, and after a few sessions (charge, fly, recharge) I started getting the hang of the controls.  Really sensitive and yet the plastic cage makes for a protected adventure.  Starting to have a lot of fun with this.  If you go into it knowing what I know now, I think that would lighten the initial frustrations. Really, if they had just included a better stand and secured it in a better way in the packaging, I would have been much more thrilled with it from the get go.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LDHA7IWEE6CJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SZ80U8#wasThisHelpful","R2LDHA7IWEE6CJ","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A year or so ago, I got a PowerAll PBJS12000R Rosso Red/Black Portable Power Bank and Car Jump Starter which I've loved.  It has provided a few emergency car starts and been a handy charger on other occasions. A few problems. It's a bit pricey (though well worth it), a bit large (though shockingly small for what it does), and gave me a bit of hassle in the airport. I got pulled aside by TSA as they looked through my bag. They let me pass through with this, but it is enough of an extra hassle that I've left it behind.What I love about this NOCO XGrid is that it is a perfect size and shape for bringing along.  I have often found myself in a situation where I'm moving from place to place and realize my phone or other USB charged tool is dying. I usually have my laptop with me, but that requires it to be open and on to charge, making for inconvenient moments of awkward laptop placement that doesn't give me near enough power because I don't have the time.  This is truly a travel charger, a camping charger, for hiking or for work or, I'd heartily suggest, for school. Easily kept in a backpack or bag, it's always handy so there's never an excuse of running out of juice.  Charge this at night if you use it. If not, the lithium ion holds its charge for a long while.  That this is rugged means its the tool that will come along on any outing, and the tool you have is better than the best tool you don't have. The flashlight is always much more handy than I expect. Having it handy means I don't fumble around in the dark, I have this nearby and use it even to find pens or usb dongles or whatever in the depths of my soft briefcase.I wish it came with a wall charger adapter, only has a USB, but adapters are pretty cheap these days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W0X2OZBK6N0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H36XX6C#wasThisHelpful","R1W0X2OZBK6N0W","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two reasons I wanted this and why I like it.  We're streaming media ever since we cut out our cable bill.  This provides a quick and steady access to our various media stored in computers and a home server.  It's a bit overkill for just streaming directly from online, as the online download speeds won't get anywhere close to what this can offer.  But, it's great for stored files, and it also keeps the wireless signal from getting bogged down with too much demand. I also have a home office where I regularly transfer very large files and folders from and to various computers (home pc, personal laptop, work laptop) using dropbox and OneDrive. Using this allows for very fast transfers, which is great when I remember at the last minute.Installation couldn't be easier.  I've found no problems at all using these at various speeds and now am more than happy to recommend this 500Mbps.  There are versions that have the plug pass through (allowing you to plug something in the adapter), but those tend to be larger boxes that tend to block a fair bit of the other outlet above, so it doesn't really help.Extremely pleased with TP-Link yet again as they've really given some flexibility to our home network that saves a fair amount of bother everyday","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K4KW8TM76HX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Q29KRK#wasThisHelpful","R3K4KW8TM76HX7","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've gotten used to optimizing my flash drive for the files I think I'll need most, but keep finding myself wishing I was back at home for that one file I didn't think about or didn't know I'd need.This is a full sized hard drive with plenty of room to spare for my needs, a fast USB 3.0 connection so I can store, use, and save files on the disk with no slow down.  What I love is that it is no thicker than the USB plug, is well-constructed, very quiet, and fits nicely into a slot inside my soft-briefcase.

"We've been sold on memory foam toppers for a number of years.  Comfortable sleep for a fraction of the price. But with a bed spring, mattress, and a topper, the bed is pretty tall.  As we reorganize our various rooms, it was a good time to reassess our bed situation. The mattress with the topper goes into the guest room (where are frequent family visitors will appreciate the larger size than the full bed), and we go lower profile with this mattress and a Classic Brands Europa Deluxe Wood Slat Platform Mattress Foundation Bed Frame.Love the packaging of mattresses these days.  Heavy box but much more manageable to get into the house and right room than before.In terms of comfort, I'm impressed.  I am a very warm sleeper, and so the latex offers more temperature comfort than the memory foam (and we had a nice topper).

"My 3 year old daughter loves being outside and notices everything. She goes on weekly adventures outdoors with her grandpa and often with me or her mom in addition.  She's curious and attentive, but easily distracted and not very careful.  I wanted to help her develop her curiosity more but didn't want to invest too much at this point.These binoculars are a very useful addition to her outing paraphernalia.  They provide a decent zoom, without too much bother. If they break or are left outside I'm not too worried. A great introduction to helping her see farther, and get used to using nice tools (that I'll help her learn how to, but not yet trust her to, take care of).  I like they look like standard binoculars and are instantly recognizable as such by my daughter who has seen more higher quality binoculars. So far no complaints about comfort.

"In academic studies, it's common to have texts that are primarily literature reviews. They usually are not not best reads nor offer the most application. However, they're essential for delving into a topic, theme, or study of any kind.  In looking at these, one has validity only inasmuch as they can show they know the broad field and what people have written about it.  Now, for every text on a topic to do this would be unwieldy and re-inventing the wheel. So, some scholars do the yeoman's work of writing a literature review so that such studies can be cited, discussed, broadened, analyzed.  The groundwork is done, so other scholars or interested parties can use the material for different purposes.Reagle here has done this for that most diffuse sort of literature: internet comments.  Diffuse but not unimportant, as a great deal of worth both in content and style can be gleaned.  Indeed, I've found that comments really give a very interesting perspective on the broad range and general pattern of human response.  I've become very interested in comments, not because I expect my mind to be changed (though this happens) but because I learn so much about people in general. We have social boundaries in most of life, but there are a few contexts where the boundaries are not formed, leaving us to expose our true personalities. Online comments are a lot like driving in that way, you can tell a lot about a person, or people, by how they drive, and what comments are left.So, while on what may seem an ephemeral topic, Reagle offers a great resource.  He gives a good overview, showing he has does rigorous and long term study, offering good frameworks and analysis. Then in each chapter he focuses on different kinds of comments/commenters: the informed, the manipulated, those seeking improvement, the alienated, the shaped, and the bemused. Often you can find all of these in the same comment thread!  For those experienced with the online world, this won't be ground breaking, but it does offer a cohesive and fairly comprehensive perspective that can be then properly cited and referred to.A great resource for my own research and writing on social media and anthropology","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L5311ACKWRQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=026202893X#wasThisHelpful","R1L5311ACKWRQ4","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very straightforward.  Durable and very user friendly, comes with two lines that are easily attached.  Firm padding, but not too firm. They're not very long, so not for a big boat, but that's not my situation.  I liked the shape, better than the round ones I've used before.  Gives a lot of flexibility for use besides as fenders, and on a boat where space can be tight, that's very nice to have something that can be used as fenders, or a seat, or padding.Given what I've read, these rectangle shapes aren't good for long term use, more surface area on the boat means they rub as the boat moves. The round one roll. Short term, that's not an issue. So more for boats that you put in the water and then use docks for various reasons than boats that are kept at docks.I have the white, but I would likely get another of the darker colors in the future, mostly because of dirt or stains or such that happen.I can't attest to long term durability yet, and that's an important issue, so if I have any problems I'll post an update here.

"This is an ideal bag for traveling on planes for short trips or if you're wanting to pack light.  It's surprisingly roomy, with a big compartment and a lot of different pockets for various items, keeping organization under control.Ideal for flying without having to check bags, the main bag can go above your heads, while the small detachable can be used at your seat. Likewise, with tourist travel, leave the bigger bag in your hotel, take the smaller one for day trips.  As a lover of water, the two roomy water bottle holders will be sufficient for decent sized bottles, like my 40oz Klean Kanteens.It's not a hiking backpack, it's a travel backpack, and it's really an amazing design. Only time and use will determine the long term durability, but it seems pretty solid.  All the straps stow away, with there even being a zippable cover for the shoulder strap, a handy addition should you want to check this bag, or are using it/carrying it in a way that the straps are annoyances.For us, this is an ideal bag to bring when we fly or, I say with a bit of hope, a great bag for traveling around in Europe or such destinations, where you want to have enough resources, but don't want to be weighed down or bothered by heavy luggage.  You really can pack well for a week with this (if you're efficient) and that makes this really versatile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OPB634QN988P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOYLCCY#wasThisHelpful","R2OPB634QN988P","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a survivalist guy, but I spent a fair amount of time outside, camping/hiking.  Meaning, I'm likely close to the target audience of this product, especially lately, where I've not been out of cell phone range for a year or so.  Add to this preface, my experience hiking in Joshua Tree. Overconfidence from prior visits, reliance on a GPS that stopped working, led to a long hike towards an oasis that, at some point, veered the wrong way.  We realized well too late we were going the wrong way and heading farther into the rocky expanse.  Some hikers coming the other direction confirmed this.  Time to turn back.  So far in, that twilight arrived. It was getting dark. Joshua Tree with no moon dark.  There was a point that we realized that if we didn't get to a recognizable trail, we'd have to stay out all night and wait for morning. I rustled around in my small bag and found what I had been hoping against all hope was there, my headlamp that I brought along for the campsite.  The batteries were low, but worked well enough. We got back, an 8 hour day of scrambling, sliding, tearing clothes.  Exhausted and exhilarated (at least I was).Ever since then, I've been very good about having emergency tools even on short hikes. A person never knows what will happen or when.  That's what I thought of when I received this. This is a ""what if"" tool. It's not a primary survival tool, nor something you'd want to rely on for regular use. It's very light, compact, and can stay in a very small bag, there when you need it. The tool you have is better than the best tool, and this is something that can stay ready for use.I didn't experience any of the problems noted by other reviews.  The multi-tool came fully functioning, and while some elements were stiff at first, everything is pretty easily accessible.  I live in California, so concerns about cold aren't really a factor. The compass is pretty cheap, but can help orient general direction to find landmarks.  The paracord is less useful, as I can't imagine retying it so compactly and so will likely never untie it. You'll need your own clip or carabiner to attach the tool itself to anything.  It's not the highest quality, to be sure, as the plastic seems of minimal quality, even as the knife, saw, sharpener are higher quality.For what this is, as a pal for survival, something to leave in the car or your small hiking bag, this works fine. Having tried it out, I have no doubt it would have been a help had we needed to spend the night in the desert.  So, I wish I had it then, and based on that, am glad I have it now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KTZ1RM2FRCN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTO5FLK#wasThisHelpful","R1KTZ1RM2FRCN6","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a three year old and an almost 11 month old, we've had our share of diapers over the last few years. Got a diaper genie before our first was born, and have been using it ever since. No complaints, other than the cost of the liners. Diaper genies are a bit like printers. You may think it's low cost at first, but they get you on the supplies. Even with a different brand of liner, it only saves a few dollars. It adds up. And it really only serves the one role, so when the last is potty trained, the Diaper Genie is going away.But, again, no problems. I didn't know there could be a better way. I think, for us, this Bubula is that better way. First off, ours worked right out the box. No problems or hassles or dents. Push down the big button on the side, the ""trap door"" opens and the diaper drops in, to be sealed back up again. Took a lot of pressure at first, but it loosens up a bit. My 3 year old can only open it the slightest bit, so I'm not worried about her getting a hand caught or dropping all manner of other items in there.The white steel looks nice and is fairly durable, though it's not very thick so vulnerable to dents if knocked over or into really hard.Some minor complaints. I would have liked to have some more information about it. In the box is just the can, with the pictorial instructions on the lid, and on a small card. It's not that complex, so not a big deal, but it seemed pretty spare in that box. The latch is my other complaint. It advertises a ""lock"" but I don't see how that works. The latch is easy opened and not terribly secure. No worse than the Diaper Genie, to be sure, but not at all ""locked"".What I love is the fact it takes regular garbage bags. Get the scented kind and it's even better. No more extra hassle of running out or getting the special brand. Holds a lot. Another great thing is this has a longer usage. Once we're done with diaper, it can serve as a nice trash can, or as we're planning, for recycled cans/bottles.More expensive at first, but really does save money in the long run, and can keep being used. A worthwhile investment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A9W2TTPBQYYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0UJ2BI#wasThisHelpful","R3A9W2TTPBQYYZ","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a variety of sleeping bags, collected from various sources, used in camping in various contexts.  My bags are mostly nicer, made for warmth in cold places, while packing small and light.  My trouble, that I run into a lot, is that I got my bags at various stages of camping goals, venturing into winter camping, or in the mountains, or hiking through national parks, both islands and forests.  Here in Southern California, these latter are more often warm than cold, and so while my bags are great for those times I go to more distant climes, I find my bags are often less suitable for the places I'm at.  Now with a young family, we're doing a lot of car camping on road trips.  Another thing, I tend to sleep really warm. That's been a quandary. I bought warm bags for times they are most needed, and make do with them when it's not so cold out.That's why I was excited about this bag.  And I love it.  It doesn't pack down very small, though a compression sack would help a fair bit. Nor is it that light. It's not something you'd throw in a backpack for a wilderness trip.  It is, however, my new favorite bag for casual campground camping and road trips.  It becomes what you need it to be, converting to being flexible for a wide variety of needs, from near freezing to summer nights.It opens fully, so can become a blanket if need be. The hood zips off, making for a nice little pillow. There is a middle layer, which is a great idea. You can sleep on top of or under the middle layer, offering comfort or warmth, or take it out altogether.  The bag has a storage sack as well as a wrap at the end that rolls around it and can be tightened (this isn't shown in the picture). The sides are exposed, but it's pretty secure and has a carrying handle. The bag itself has straps for carrying by hand or over your shoulder.If I could design a perfect bag for me to bring along on road trips or campgrounds, this is pretty close to everything I would want. My more expensive bags are going to get a lot less use now, keeping them only for more adventurous outings.Definitely recommend.  Size/weight are bit high, but for the cost that's to be expected. What you get is definitely well worth the money in terms of flexibility and design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27URULQELXJTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOYKVSK#wasThisHelpful","R27URULQELXJTR","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the book I needed at this moment.  I'm in the early stages of discussing a new venture with a good friend of mine. It's a great idea, untapped market, etc. and so on. He has experience starting and running companies. I don't.  It's trendy to say one has an entrepreneurial gift, but I don't.Some of that has to do with personality. Which is fine, I offer other elements to the table. A lot of it has to do with experience.  Being in the world of business and start-ups and contexts of development offers their own lessons.  That's not where I've been, but I'm moving towards needing facility in those places.

"I have good Bible computer software. I also have a seminary degree and a PhD in Theology.I like having a print concordance around even still for several reasons. One, I like print still. I am on or near a computer all day, and this book lets me step away from that. My brain works differently when I'm turning pages and reading real texts, making connections.Two, I like something that is more immediately useful to others. I think in our day and age, anyone can have a quality knowledge of how to best engage the text.  This book allows me to sit down and walk them through a quick process of intro word studies, using a tool that they can buy (rather than the 100s or more that the higher quality software costs).  The NIV provides a common resource focus.Third, as to this concordance itself, it packs in a great deal of content in one volume.  It's well presented and organized, easy to take up and get to using.  Or, browsing.  I like bookstores for the same reason.  I learn through browsing. Sometimes I don't know the questions to ask, and by thumbing through, finding myself enjoying the puzzle and quest, this book provides a source of discovery.All translation is interpretation.  If you don't have a strong facility with the original languages a concordance like this one provides the closest way you'll find to get at original terms, how they are used, and how the translators use them in different contexts. By having a dictionary as well (though a basic one that also involves interpretation), this provides an excellent starting point and overall resource for most general needs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y9BU6T7HR9CA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310262933#wasThisHelpful","R2Y9BU6T7HR9CA","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I begin with a qualification, this is not a review of Habermas's ideas. I will admit to finding more affinity with Luhmann than Habermas, even as I find Habermas essential for understanding not only contemporary sociological trends but indeed his influence runs deep into many other fields.This current text primarily explores Habermas's perspectives on the European Union, it is an argument, a plea, and the standard moral posturing. In effect, the arguments utilized a logical and thoughtful combination of encouragement, insight, and shaming. It is his life's work applied to what may be the most direct application of his thought in what is, and questionably will remain as, the European Union. Although he is reaching an advanced age, he seems as sharp as ever, while decidedly interested in his legacy.As such, this book would be of interest to various concerns. Those interested in Habermas would certainly find this text worthwhile, for a recent example of his work as he enters into his twilight. Those interested in European politics, recent history and underlying political theory, will find this an excellent resource. And those interested in the broader application of sociology, especially as there is an increasing tension with the approaches from the late modern era as expressed in postmodern contexts.As I mentioned, while I'm not ultimately convinced of Habermas's theory or his arguments here, he is the leading edge of the discussions even still, a powerhouse that has made claim for sociology, and with it other social sciences, to have a reforming and ethical task in our societies. It's mostly related to issues around the core theme of the EU, with a couple of interesting essays with a focus on Jewish contributions: an essay on postwar German Jewish philosophers and sociologists, and an essay on Martin Buber in particular.The book itself is quite readable, if you are used to Habermas or other such theorists. The translation is straightforward. Though I don't have the original German to compare it with, the sentences retain a fair amount of academic German feel in style and structure. This means that the book could gain from being edited in terms of style and readability, making it more approachable to an English reading audience, but that is another layer of editing that such texts rarely receive.The content itself is generally more grounded in application and context, making it relatively accessible. As such, it's also a good starting place for Habermas, with his other works providing more theoretical construction. Not that this text lacks such, but it is not the main focus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BLXP9NHXD9F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745686826#wasThisHelpful","R3BLXP9NHXD9F2","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not disappointed.The aroma is pretty strong at first, though it's also long lasting and spreads around, so don't judge it based on right when you spray it. My wife is much more sensitive to smells these days (sensory overload as she calls it) than I am, so she reacted a fair bit more strongly when I was trying it out for the first time.  She was sitting in the room and exclaimed how strong it smelled. That being said, yesterday she asked me to spray in our daughters room while they were out at the store.So we really like this.

"I got this as a party game for my son's first birthday. He's worthy. That's a little ways off, so I had to, of course, open it up and test it out. Immediate fun. Needs 3 AAA batteries which aren't provided, so make sure you have those on hand. Once installed, this hammer really is great. It's a built in party game. The hammer itself is made of a thick foam, so you can hit it on a variety of surfaces without worrying about breaking the toy or what you're hitting. It really takes a hard swing to get the highest score, so this isn't just for kids. Yet, it's not intimidating for kids. My 3 year old daughter was able to get some mid-level scores, which makes me think there's a combination of the swinging motion and the impact that ranks the total points.Good sounds, with a dramatic sound that turns on, and one when it's totaling the score. I wish there was a small sound when it was ready to smash again. Sometimes I would go too quick and it wouldn't register.It comes with a target on the back of the box, but as the hammer was a little tricky to get out, I ended up tearing the target a fair bit in the process. It's supposed to be cut out. Would have been a nicer to have a target included in the box, something plastic that would last. That's a minor frustration for something we didn't really need.For the fun and for the price this is a great toy. Great for parties or to have around. Good for stress relief too at the office or elsewhere. Though, of course, keep an eye on kids (or feisty adults) who use this, the foam is a bit inviting to try to get a high score using a friends arm or head.Oden definitely recommends this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TTFFDHB3MNAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHLA1V2#wasThisHelpful","R2TTFFDHB3MNAJ","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm not as big of a fan of the grommet style, as some light gets in through there, but that's not a big deal. To keep light from coming in from the sides we used a darkening wrap rod.Definite thumbs up from me, and I was admittedly wary at first. It's the curtains we're keeping up in my daughters room, replacing her older blackout curtains, so that's the best review possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39YOJYQRFZWQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N133HTY#wasThisHelpful","R39YOJYQRFZWQD","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our bedroom windows are west-facing, so we get late afternoon and evening sun.  In the summer, this becomes an issue because our 3 year old daughter goes to bed around 7, and it's still bright outside.  We also have a neighbor who likes to, for whatever reason, to keep a flood light on all night in their yard. It's not pointed at us, but there's enough light that pours our way to keep it from getting dark.  I like to sleep in the dark. Weird, I know.So, we've invested in blackout curtains over the last few years, and have seen the variety in style and quality. These are a good set.  It's really more of a ""milk chocolate"" color, a bit lighter than other chocolate colored products we own, but it's pleasant, and matches enough.  The nickel grommets are pretty bright, more so than they appear in the picture.The key is they block out the light, and they do a good job of that.  These are shorter than the ones we've been using, and that fits our windows better. The width is great, and as you're getting two panels, the price is very reasonable.The material is soft and feels like curtains, so doesn't stand out as being different in that way, so these are really win-win-win for us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B40YAFM9Q96R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EEDPOW8#wasThisHelpful","R1B40YAFM9Q96R","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a little handy, but not that handy.  Needed, and wanted for a long while, a new faucet but was a little intimidated by the process.  I've done other repairs, so no real need for concern, but anything new is still a bit uncomfortable.  No concerns at all here. Everything you need except a few tools and sealant/sealing tape is included, with the faucet itself the various attachments, including a drain plug.  Instructions are in that ""no words but descriptive diagram"" pattern that works no matter your language, but is a bit more confusing than you'd wish.  Even still, it didn't take too long of staring and deciphering to get at what was next.  And then it works, it just works, and works so nicely, and with style.The warranty covers leaks and drips ""to the  original consumer for as long as the original consumer purchaser owns their home.""

"After a couple years of low rain and a lot of other concerns, my lawn had fairly departed. I started a rebuilding phase, with reseeding and getting it looking good, then realized it wasn't just the grass I planted.  I found this turf builder a great solution and am repeating it this year as a way of keeping my lawn healthy and what I want it to be.  I'm a renter, so I'm not going to invest a lot in a lawn, but I have young kids, and a bit of pride, so I'm wanting it to stay healthy into Spring and Summer.

"This is an easy to assemble option for use with a trundle bed or as a rolling bed/cot for other places.  As I said it was easy to assemble, with clear instructions and tools included.  I actually went backwards and got this before the daybed frame, as we needed a useable frame for my daughters room, underneath her bunk bed and I wanted to get something that would persist in use.Use is fine, if you're using underneath a daybed, watch the height, otherwise the comfort depends on the quality of mattress. We have a foam twin mattress pad that we pull out for using this, part of the bedding we add.  My only question is durability, but that will obviously take some time to assess.

"Relatively easy to attach with instructions that give steps for a variety of different attachments. The blades are packed loose in the box, so no extra packaging to deal with (which is great!), the blades themselves have a plastic sheath so are protected while being shipped from nicks or damage. It wasn't quite as smooth as others I have used to put on, but with a bit of a tug there was a satisfying click, and all was fine.  The blade slides nice across the windshield, no streaking at all, even when my windshield was a little dirty and I was testing it with windshield spray.  In a light rain, worked perfectly fine.Here in southern California we get the occasional heavy rain alternating with dry and sometimes hot. Summers get very warm here in the valley, so the test for me is how well these will hold up over time.

"We live in SoCal, eastern suburbs of LA County. It gets hot here.  It never gets cold, though it does get cooler at times, just never cold. My lawn took a beating in the drought this last year and so even as we get a little rain, there are some patches (well, about half my small back yard) that there's no growth going to happen.  We rent, so I'm not interested in invested in anything, but I want a decent lawn for my kids and myself.Scotts seed has worked great for me before, and so I happily am trying out the Bermuda seed. The bag itself is pretty small, but well packed. It's about 50% seed in weight, and about 50% water smart plus fertilizer coating.  So, it absorbs moisture and has about 3% nitrogen content.For re-seeding, it will cover about 1,000 square feet, about a third of a tennis court. New lawn, bare ground, it coves about 1/8 of a Tennis court. So this size works if you have a small lawn area or just some patches along the way. I have a very patchy small lawn, so this works perfect for my needs.The seed works well, and I'll update this later after a couple months to talk about longer term results","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REUHPE2MDU8MT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D4AESXS#wasThisHelpful","REUHPE2MDU8MT","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't tell my dentist, I don't floss regularly.  List an excuse, I've used it and still do.  I get the importance, so it's not a matter of that.  It's just that I don't do it.  I don't like it.  I don't like the whole process.That being said, I'm the perfect market for this.  I love it.  That's about as clear as I can get.  It's great. So easy to use.  Charge it up, the charge lasts from 11 days to many weeks (depending on the setting). You can have it go 1 burst, 2 burst, or 3 burst. Put it between a couple teeth, press the button on top, there you go. Fill it with water or mouthwash. It comes with a small bottle of mouthwash.  Very easy to hold and easy to manage. Though, my interest in watching it work the first couple times resulted in some splashes on the bathroom mirror.  It shoots a quick burst of air mixed with liquid, and that's it.  My mouth has never felt more clean, that's the truth.I like gadgets and tend to use a gadget if it makes things easier and more fun. This really is a quick and easy and thorough method. It's a little pricey, to be sure, compared to regular floss.  But, it's something that I'll actually use versus regular floss.

"I'll admit it. I don't like eating my vegetables. I'm already tall and strong, so the traditional arguments don't help. Except, well, there's my high blood pressure that's nagging at me if I don't keep on top of it with diet and exercise. Those servings of greens become necessary. But I don't want ta eat my peas!This fits in nicely to my goals. I want to keep my weight down in general, and take probiotics and fiber pills as well. Now, every morning, I get a glass full of veggies and so much other goodness. The price is high, higher than I'd want to add to my budget, but I realize this doubles up some of the other stuff I'm taking.The taste is about what I'm used to with powdered drink mix. There's a slight berry taste that is fine, but mostly it is a bit bland. No sugar added means it's not going to taste like soda or juice. If you're having the normal amount of sugar for our society, that's too much anyhow, so it takes a bit of time to get one's sweet tooth more sensitive. I wouldn't say it's necessarily good, but it's not bad. Fairly neutral. No vegetable taste at all, however, which is a boon for me.What one serving provides: 20g of protein, 6 servings of greens (yay!), 50% daily vitamins (so it's not replacing a multi-vitamin), 25% daily fiber, 1.5g omega3 (so no more fish oil supplements), a whole lot of antioxidants (equivalent to 3.3 cups of blueberries), a daily amount of probiotics, all at 160 calories. This is meant for providing a balanced nutrition to the day, and it really offers a lot in one serving.Worth the cost? Depends on how you're getting all this offers. For me, the price is high but since I'll drink this daily but very rarely get enough greens on a given day, it's a good investment for my health.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8B2F08ER8VQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0Y130U#wasThisHelpful","RY8B2F08ER8VQ","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Interesting, and well written, but closer to ""extraordinary possible origins of things that I quickly researched.""  It's hard with a book like this to fact check everything without spending significantly more time than I have, but I know a few things about certain things, and those things tended to have details wrong.  Big things? Maybe not, but enough small details to make me question the veracity of the topics I'm not familiar with.  Some issues might be differences of opinion based on murky history (I thought the first section on superstitions had a fair amount of supposition presented as fact), some minor things that are clearly wrong but not a huge deal (Tertullian was not a priest, he was possibly a lawyer and certainly a lay leader in the early church).  These add up over the course of the book to give that element of distrust, which ruins a book of trivia for me. It's not rigorously researched and reflects something fairly below even a wikipedia level of accuracy. It's a bit like having a lot of good facts for a few pages then throwing in something like ""Did you know that War and Peace was originally titled ""War. What is it Good For?"" (credit to Seinfeld for that reference)A 'fact' that would make you sound stupid if you're talking to people who know the field.  But the trouble is that it's not clear which fits the fact category and which are ""factish."" Maybe a lot of this is really authoritative, but introduce a bit of clear doubt and it's not clear what the percentage is between research and ""let's run with this version because no one is going to check."" Indeed, wikipedia is probably a much better resource, as the mistatements and misfacts (can I make up that word) would have been edited clean.  If I can't be sure something is actually the case, then it's not really worth it to me to find out someone's opinions. This book is sitting in a living room with Panati while he tells you what he thinks about things and stuff.  He's a smart guy, very knowledgeable, but not quite as knowledgeable as he thinks. There are clearly areas that are much more authoritative, it's just a mixed bag.  I wish I didn't spend the money on it.

"We've gone through a selection of point and shoots over the last 5 years. A problem has developed over the last few years as cameras that are great for outdoor shots or provide a nice image if well-set up just don't catch those moments of toddler delight.  With a new baby in the house as of last summer, we realized that we were taking a lot of pictures with only a small percentage turning out.  Time to step up. I have a budding interest in photography, with some friends who are professionals, so I looked at the DSLR possibilities. This one went on sale over Christmas, and I made a quick decision to go with this NEX-5TL instead.  I regretted it at first. I liked the idea of the control of a DSLR, going to the next level of learning and photography with it.  This one?  Well, the day I got it all regrets were gone.The pictures are astounding.  Low-light pictures come out so very clear, with great color and focus. We don't even use the flash.  Great for action shots and portraits.  The small size means that it's easy to bring, the best camera to use is the one you have with you after all, and having had larger cameras before, leaving them at home more often than not, this is a great bonus. The camera can be set to recognize specific faces and focus on those faces, a great feature when we're taking pictures of our two kids a lot as they move around or just look cute in less than ideal lighting.My wife and I also take this camera out on dates and other outings, so have made a surprising amount of use of the selfie-tilting LCD.  I had a camera with a rotating LCD and was sad to see that go, but with the selfie feature and the above your head tilt, this really fills almost almost every circumstance I needed it.This is an astounding camera for our needs. Small enough to bring, powerful enough to get shots in all sorts of situations and conditions.  The only critique I have is the touch-screen, which isn't very sensitive so usually takes more work than hitting the buttons. That's a very minor issue for me in light of the overall quality. Without reservation I recommend this camera especially to families who want to take a lot of high quality pictures without having to spend a lot of time setting up the perfect shot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y9TSRI0Y6PHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENZRP38#wasThisHelpful","R2Y9TSRI0Y6PHB","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a fan of fans. I get hot pretty easy, like a cool breeze on my face, like the movement of air around me.  Even when it's cold, I don't like still air. Which has led to a fair amount of fans in my life.  Desk fans, box fans, ceiling fans, window fans, floor fans, I've got 'em.Fans serve a variety of purposes for me, some provide noise (I'm addicted to fan white noise at night), some move air, some keep me cool.  I woldn't have though much of a USB fan, as I've had camping fans that have variable success.  Fans seem to be either too much or too little, too big or too weak. Making for awkward placement.This one hits a sweet spot. It's pretty quiet, so not going to address white noise needs. But it's a perfect size, sits very nicely on a stack of books.  I have a Verilux Tazza Productivity Desk Lamp that has a USB socket, so this plugs nicely into that and they sit together (this saves me using more power from my computer).  The speed is adjustable from a minimum to a maximum, turning the knob allows for precise control more like a dimming switch (not just 3 settings like most fans).  I wish the fan had more tilt on it, it doesn't really tilt much, that's why I have it on a stack of books.  That's my only complaint.I also like this as a potential camping or car fan, anywhere you can plug in a USB. So, this might get a lot of use. I'll update if there are any developing issues or short life span.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BURHWHEY83DL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQ1X6MI#wasThisHelpful","R3BURHWHEY83DL","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our place isn't big, but it's thin and long, with our router on one end of the house and the master bedroom on the other.  When we shut the door the signal doesn't drop right away but gets iffy.  In the garage, which is even further past our bedroom, the signal really degrades. I'm currently setting up the garage to do some various work projects, some on my laptop (it's quieter in there) and others using power tools. For the latter, I've been using online guides, so would love to have a steady signal.This provides a great solution for me.  Easily set up and adds a stronger signal at the end of the house. I can unplug it easy and put it in the garage for an even better signal when I need it there.  It's not as potent as my main router, either in speed or signal quality, but I don't need it to be.  My only minor frustration is that I wish I go the wireless AC speed, as that matches my router. My laptop doesn't actually pick up that signal, so it's not a big deal at all, with the wireless N working just fine for what I need.

"My almost 3 year old saw this and loved it right away.  When we opened it up and I showed her the pieces and how it worked, she eagerly took it and played with it, then we played together with this set later that day.  Definitely a winner with her.Two girl bears, not a boy and a girl like I assumed for some reason.  The pieces have a great amount of variety, with fun colors and prints, suggesting a lot of different styles.  Mostly old school, with most of the accessories reflecting decades past, so this set is new but feels classic, like it's something my wife had when she was young.The box is good, with a plastic cover  that slides on and off, and different sections for the pieces.Some minor complaints.  First, the pieces aren't sized that well. Some are too big and don't fit with other piece that well.  Want a bear to have a scarf? That and shoes are all she's wearing.  The magnets are a bit weak, and so the bears aren't really going to go on any pretend adventures once they get gussied up.  And the hats, because of sizing and weak magnets, don't really stick at all.  No layering is possible as the magnets only work if they're directly on the bear.Overall, for the price, this is a fun set. Longer lasting than paper, more durable and nicer than plastic, but with a few drawbacks that I noticed but my daughter didn't seem to be bothered by. She loves it and that's what counts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2002H52HQ0SJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I64DYU#wasThisHelpful","R2002H52HQ0SJR","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My third book is officially getting published tomorrow.  I don't exactly write for a living--my books don't sell that well--but I do write for a life.  I love writing, finding it a joy and a balm to my soul, though one that I took a while to embrace.Back when I finished grad school and decided that I didn't want to go into the field that I was educated for, I started to write, every day. And I read.  I read an essay by Jack London, I don't even remember which it was, and he mentioned how he would get up every morning and write a 1000 good words each day.  He could often write more, and early in his career he went well beyond this, only he figured that 1000 words made for a good goal and habit, a target that once reached could allow for a sense of accomplishment.  And 1000 words, he found, was what he could depend on to be good, more and they started to get suspicious.I've fallen out of the writing habit for the last couple of years--the new book was finished in early 2013--with other responsibilities clamoring for my time. Now I'm getting back to it, and thought about London's pattern again, the one that worked for me.  I saw Sarah Stodola's book and realized there were a lot more models out there.  I've read a fair amount of books by writers about writing.  Lamott and Sol Stein the most influential among them.  But not every writer writes about writing, so one is left wondering.Stodola provides a very welcomed study into the writing lives of 18 writers, from different eras and different styles.  London isn't mentioned, but I'm already familiar with his habits, so that's not a loss to me.  Over the course of the book, I learned and I listened and I watched as these successful writers sat as models for analysis.  Not really analysis, I guess, more description.  Stodola has done some wonderful research and provides a straightforward picture of her subjects.  Which I appreciate.  Some writers might want to intrude too much, Stodola is respectful to those who are giants in writing and masters in the craft.  I'm not as much of a fan of Stodola's own style, but that is a personal bias, as this is a very capable book.I gained some good tips, was affirmed in some of my own habits (they did that too?!), and sometimes had to come to terms with the very different personalities than my own, whose habits just wouldn't fit my personality or life.I definitely recommend Process if you're looking to get a substantive study of how masters pursue their craft on a daily and project basis. It's something I'm going to read again and again over the years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DMZ8FOV9QS96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477801081#wasThisHelpful","R3DMZ8FOV9QS96","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Installed this in my 2010 Dell Inspiron 9100 desktop. Had taken my old network card out a while ago to make room for a better video card and have been using a TP-LINK TL-PA4010KIT AV500 Nano Powerline Adapter Starter Kit, which has been working fine with my Verizon FIOS connection.  I had the Verizon wireless N router, so the adapter kit was getting me faster speeds than wireless signal. I got a TP-LINK Archer C8 AC1750 Dual Band Wireless AC Gigabit Router, 2.4GHz 450Mbps+5Ghz 1300Mbps, 1 USB 2.0 Port & 1 USB 3.0 Port, IPv6, Guest Network in September which I connected to the Verizon router (while turning off the signal of that router).  So, I had AC speed in the air, and no way to take advantage. The next month, I got a  TP-LINK Archer T4U AC1200 Wireless Dual Band USB Adapter and have been using that in my desktop along with the wired connection, but that adapter also got use with my laptop.We have a couple laptops, tablets, phones, Fire TV, etc. getting almost constant use in the house, so having a strong, consistent signal is great and having a signal that isn't getting swallowed up by other electronics is even better.  So, I thought it time to take the step with the desktop.  I'm a big dropbox user and we have media on the desktop as well, so a lot gets transferred between computers, not just from the internet, making a faster wireless a strong desire.Easily installed, had to run the setup from the disk to get it working right, but then everything connected great.  Got both signals working, not at the same time, and of course then committed to the faster AC signal.I'm getting a steady 877.5 Mbps, with occasional bumps up to 1.3Gbps.  The router is 2 rooms over, so not that far away, and it's giving me 5 bars of signal.  No drops yet. Very pleased. Will update if I encounter any issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BOHAIUIXM4VC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RL4A314#wasThisHelpful","R3BOHAIUIXM4VC","A2AC6GQ24S45GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AC6GQ24S45GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're wanting to punch standard 3 holes into paper, this Swingline is probably as good as you're going to get for a manual.Heavy duty construction, feels solid, locks in a closed position to save space for putting in a cabinet.  My almost 3 year old was able to push down on it and punch some holes through her coloring pages, so that shows it doesn't take a lot of force.My one minor complaint is that the tray underneath is a bit hard to close and tends to open a bit when I move it, getting little dots of paper. This is heavy enough to find its own permanent spot, though, so it's not a big deal.I'm a professor and writer, so I have a lot of paper even though I try to do most things electronically these days.

"Pretty straightforward, it looks like the picture, attaches in the regular way as other straps.  It's well constructed (as far as I can tell having it only a short while--I'll update later if it has issues).What I especially like is the material. It's soft and comfortable on the skin, much better than nylon straps or others that I've used that can be rough.  Given that it will be rubbing on the wrist for potentially long periods of time, this is important, as discomfort would lead me to take it off, and that entirely defeats the purpose.

"We have a little girl (almost 3) and a little boy (6 months) and that means we have a lot of parties ahead of us, to hold and to go to.  We enjoy cooking, and being creative with desserts.  This helps in a wonderful way.  Very easy and straightforward to use.  I got the 4-piece version which comes with 3 tips and a silicone bottle.  Honestly, I'd suggest going with the 8 piece.

"To be honest I was really impressed with these storage boxes. They are well made and look so much better in person. The price is wonderful for three boxes and each one is wrapped separately so they can't scratch each other during shipping. They are stacked inside each other when you open the box in a large bag and then individually wrapped with thin paper foam and a plastic bag around each.The pink is nice and soft and would look amazing anywhere, desk, shelves, stacked in a corner, bathroom, laundry or closet area. You can leave them with the opening up to hold things or lie them on their sides for a nice shelf like box.They came in Small, Medium and Large and like I mentioned can be stacked when not in use.My daughter quickly confiscated these. She is using the large to put her weekly outfits for school in which she picks out on Sunday. They are all folded inside. The second largest she wants for her collection of Big Eye Beanie Babies or Beanie Boos and the last she is using for DVDs.I think this is a great idea for a baby shower gift as well. Fill them with diapers and wipes, bottles, towels, wash clothes, sleepers and wrap into an amazing gift.Disclaimer: I received a deep discount for my honest opinion.

"My daughter loves doing her nails.The kit is pretty nice. The box shows off all the colors and some beautifully colored pics of well manicured hands and nail art work.The pens can be used as regular nail polish with the brush and all or as pens that you can squeeze the paint out with the finest pointThe nail polish isn't like normal polish. It smells badly like normal polish but it was kind of gloppy and thick using it as the nail polish brush. My daughter complained and asked if I would paint her nails. I thought perhaps it was because she can't do it herself but it was kinda thick when I did it for her. It took a long time to dry and she was in a hurry to do nail art.Patience is a virtue in many things but especially when doing art. I like using the nail polish pen and felt like I had total control using the pen.The polish came out easily and fine. You could totally draw on your nails. I was making swirls all over a notebook to test it out.My daughter opened the top and stabbed her finger with the tip of the pen I am not sure how she managed that but I think it is because those caps are definitely safely on.The kit also comes with a star mail file and nail stickers.There are tiny stickers you can stick on your nails to accessorize or the ones you can fill in with nail polish from the fine pencil.It takes some patience and there is a learning curve. When my daughter used the pen the polish started leaking from the top.I think it is a fun kit but not for anyone under 13","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SRNB1P5RQFL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV0XVDQ#wasThisHelpful","R3SRNB1P5RQFL4","AY3EENC2BGTGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3EENC2BGTGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yesterday I received these silicone egg rings to try out. They came in a box individually wrapped with Styrofoam inserts to help them keep their shape during shipping. I opened two up, gave them a quick rinse with some soap and water and dried them. Since I wasn't sure if I should spray them with cooking spray, I did anyway figuring it wouldn't hurt. Since last night I cooked eggs for my son and learned you do not need to spray them. Break the egg into the ring but make sure the ring is laying completely flat in the pan or you will get egg leakage. Basically that just means the egg white spills out from underneath the ring.  No biggie considering most of the egg stays inside.  I guess if  you are cooking scrambled eggs or pancakes the instructions say to put the ring in the batter and put down into the pan because it will start cooking creating a barrier for the egg or batter to stay inside. You can flip the eggs if necessary. As soon as your egg cooks on the bottom, slip off the ring or do like I do and put a lid on the pot to get a cover over the yolk.When you are done give them a soak in water and soap, dry them and they are ready to go again. These rings will come in handy for making pancakes, hamburgers and more.Disclaimer: I received a complimentary product for my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27ZM812JRK1MM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYCEZQO#wasThisHelpful","R27ZM812JRK1MM","AY3EENC2BGTGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3EENC2BGTGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used the wax on Saturday! When I opened the top I was concerned because the directions say to remove the top and the seal over the wax. The top was no problem but the seal impossible. It was completely attached to the wax and I was unsure if I could put the seal in the microwave. It was fine. 8 seconds in the microwave and I removed the seal.After that I stirred it with the wooden spatulas and put a sample on my wrist to make sure it wasn't too hot. It was fine so I proceed with my forearm. It was the place I figured I could see easily and control the amount of pressure.I smeared some wax on it, put a strip on, took a deep breath and ripped it off. Pain yes. If you have been waxed you know there is this moment when you think OK here it goes. Then you pull or the person waxing you pulls and it doesn't really hurt as much as you think it will. It stings YES. But not that bad. I moved onto the top of my hand where there isn't much but since I already had a paper and wax ready I proceed. Not bad AND it definitely made my arm smooth and hair free.Why not move onto my legs? I did...my legs are so smooth. I could never get that kind of smooth with shaving.Today, for review purposes I decided to to my knees. I tried to open the jar and could not. Not even a little. I ran it under hot water and tried again. NOPE! I ran it under hot water for a second time and wah-la...it opened. SO I suggest you always really clean the top of the jar and place it upright unlike me who closed it and tossed the box under the sink. Applying the wax again I concentrated on my knees. Apply the wax, put the paper over it. Run your hand or finger over the paper two times and pull against the hair growth. I think it would remove even if you went with the hair growth but I followed directions.  The hardest part of ripping that piece of paper off your skin is just before you pull. You are so sure it will be excruciating.  It isn't! Hurts yes but oddly enough, I don't mind it.It is truly amazing how easily the hair comes out. Takes way less time then when you shave or tweeze and the area is so smooth!!!I will be buying this again in the future with extra paper kits so I don't have to worry about running out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V2LZLAJS9WIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5R9E9C#wasThisHelpful","R2V2LZLAJS9WIY","AY3EENC2BGTGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3EENC2BGTGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My daughter and I dabble in art. We love painting, sketching, and all forms of mixed media so getting an easel was just one of the things we knew we would eventually get. The box was tall and light so when I started opening it and saw a bag with a screw driver in it I was surprised but quickly noticed that most of it was already put together. While I worked on the tall piece my daughter fit the shelves into the fitted slots on the legs. They are removable and in order to fold and store they will need to be removed. We don't have a place to keep it out so it will be stored and taken out when we need it. Thankfully it would only mean opening and reinserting the shelves.The easel comes in 8 pieces with four of those being the shelves. The tall piece needs four screws to affix it to the base. It comes with all necessary hardware.There are two pieces that slide into the large standing piece which will become the top and bottom for your easel.Pros:It was easy to put togetherIt looks wonderfulIt is completely adjustable to the size of your easelCons:There was a small crack in the large piece. It doesn't affect it in any way and was in the back so you can't even see it.The large piece is really really tall. I would probably cut a foot or two off.The placement of the back leg made it hard to put the bottom screws in easily. They got in but my hand kept hitting the back leg.The bottom drawers bang my legs when I stand close to the easel as you would to paint.All in all I love this piece and think the price is fairly good.Disclaimer: I received a product at a deep discount for my honest opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z9V8L8AIJD3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQWH1A4#wasThisHelpful","R2Z9V8L8AIJD3S","AY3EENC2BGTGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3EENC2BGTGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thought this was a very interesting product. I am not sure why tomato was chosen as I would have gone with a Cherry for Cherry lips but my kids love the tomato so I have had to hide it.It is strange to put this thing up to my lips and create a suction that at first made me nervous because my lips did in fact pull into the tomato easily. They stayed puckered and the tomato stays firmly on your lips with the suction you create making your lips plump up.How it works:Take the top of the tomatoplace the tomato top on your lips. You can work on only one or both. I chose both. You place the center of your lip at the line that separates the two bottom sections.Pull your lips into the tomato without allowing any saliva into the tomato and sit 2 minutes with your lips inside the tomato. If you lose suction and you will unless you have a perfect seal, just do it again. It is really easy.When you remove your lips not only look fuller but feel fuller.it doesn't hurt or create any bruising and while you look silly with a tomato hanging onto your lips it does definitely create a fuller mouth.Disclaimer: I received a complimentary product for my honest opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32U14PS4UTNLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015AEH42C#wasThisHelpful","R32U14PS4UTNLD","AY3EENC2BGTGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3EENC2BGTGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so impressed with this makeup mirror. Let's start with the packaging. It comes in a white box with the mirror name on the front and in two parts which easily pop together with a screw at the base. The mirror and base are inside Styrofoam that fits it perfectly to protect it during shipping.The mirror is double sided with 1X on one and 10X magnification on the other. It is perfect for make-up application or facial hair removal. You can pose the mirror in whatever incline you need for the best view and it doesn't slip. The mirror stays tight even if you have it laying at a completely horizon position on it's axis. Which means I can get those two neck hairs (why do I have hair on my neck?) that sprout up almost daily.We have it in the bathroom for the best lighting but I keep finding it in my daughter's room. I guess at 10 she is deciding she needs her own mirror.I received a complimentary product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

"I seriously need at least three more of these and two for gifts. I didn't expect much when just a little acrylic organizer with a few drawers but was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box. It is definitely a 4 piece acrylic drawer organizer but it is very well made. It doesn't seem cheap or flimsy at all. It is very hard and thick. All edges are sanded with the drawers pulling out and going back in very fluidly. They don't' get stuck or off track.There is a piece of felt in the each drawer and you can either have the two draws on the top or the bottom depending on how you flip it. The felt is not attached so if you flip it the felt becomes the floor either way.I see so many uses for this. We will be using this for tweezers, scissors and things in the bathroom but it could be used for:JewelrySmall collection pieces for displayPost it notes for your desk and pretty pensCosmeticsAND more.The next one I get will be used on my desk for my post its and pens and pencils.Great piece.

"I love these unbreakable wine glasses and think they make a great gift idea if you are doing a wine basket, new home basket or just because you are sick of breaking yet another wine glass!When these arrived my husband actually thought it was a beer cozy and tried to put his beer inside it saying it was too tight. We had a chuckle and I told him that these were actually wine glasses.He thought for sure that they would tip if you filled them and placed them down or that you would squeeze the liquid right out of them. I guess the squeezing thing is a possibility if you want to be an animal about it but hopefully you just drink like a normal human being.I doubt any wine will be drunk out of mine because my kids have confiscated them. I guess these could also be considered great for kids too. Not too young because like I said you could squeeze them hard enough and spill your liquid.My daughter was convinced they were glow in the dark because of the color but unfortunately for her they are not.They also come with bonus items and while I failed to take a photo of them in their box (kids took them out before I had a chance to stop them). Everything came in a white box with a circular potion in motion label sealing the box. Each glass (LOL I feel strange writing glass because they are NOT) was individually wrapped and there was a bag of extras. There were two wine corks thingies, (they seal beer too as my husband proved to me) and a bottle opener.This is a great set to give someone if you are giving the gift of wine.

"Sweet little speaker. It fits in my hand but packs a punch. It is bluetooth ready for hook up to your bluetooth music device BUT it also plays relaxation sounds that last about 20 mins.I have used these sounds more than the bluetooth but love that I can do that if I want to. The sounds include rain, brook, white noise and the ocean although I wish it had a few more sounds.You can also hook up your blue tooth to listen to a call. It is the perfect speaker for when you need to take care of things around the house, want to continue your call but need your hands. The speaker on my phone makes that impossible. The BeGrit has a microphone so you can use it on your calls.

"This Princess Table Top Castle Vanity from Velocity Toys is so cute. Very girls! Very pink!It comes in four parts. The mirror, the base and two pink pieces to hold the mirror in the base.  Once the arms are into the mirror you cannot get them out.

"We love our Keurig and love coffee. Sometimes there are three to four boxes of various coffee stacked on my tiny counter. First there is no room and second it is far from organized. Now that I have this carousel I can display all the various brands so we know what we have and what we can offer to friends.This has cleared up so much space on my counter and I love looking at it.  I love seeing all the different coffee available. It makes me happy and I love that it holds 24 K-Cups.Right out of the box it is ready to be filled.  The K-Cups sit in the holes securely and even with all the spinning we are doing, none have fallen out.  The best K-Cups to use are the ones in the plastic K-Cups not the ones that have a soft filter.

"The Muscle Roller Stick is used for Muscle Massage in Sports, Injury and Rehabilitation. It's great for deep tissue muscle as long as you apply a lot of pressure while rolling. It is great for increasing flexibility, loosening tight muscles and increasing blood flow to use the pain of muscle soreness.  If you can roll out dough, you can roll out some muscle pain.The stick has handles on both ends with these texture like balls around it that move independently of each other and the stick.  When I use it on my husband he likes me to roll with all my might. When I use it on my daughter or son they like it just rolled without any pressure. So far no one has used it on me. Wahhh...I have used it on my calves and thighs and really enjoy it. Can't wait to have someone use it on my back though..hint..hint.The stick is also light weight and easy to stick in your gym bag or suitcase so you can bring it wherever you may need help with a muscle ache.Disclaimer: I received a complimentary product for my honest opinion.

"I found the set up to be easy. If you look at it you will figure it out. Took me about 3.5 minutes to set it up right out of the box with no directions. After use, I was able to fold it right back up, remove the pieces I had to attach and put it right back the way it came.This aluminum tabletop easel is a nice size. It feels steadier than some of the wood ones I have used in class.Remove from the box, take everything out of the plastic (it comes in three separate pieces.The long, big piece seems confusing at first but simply open up the legs, tighten the screws. Insert the top canvas holder by loosening the screw and place it on the top slot. Slide to where you need it as it is completely adjustable.Take the bottom canvas holder and do the same.

"My daughter loves art. Together we must spend about 5-10 hours a week creating, drawing, painting, sketching and we are always looking for art supplies.This easel by US Art Supply is a wonderful addition. We love that it is wood and that it can be carried everywhere.It is also completely adjustable. I love my easel very high and she likes her almost completely flat. This works for both of us.We love that it comes with a drawer which surprised us. We love the easel alone and the surprise of the storage drawer for our supplies makes this even better.There is a latch on the easel part that is just a quick flip to open. Adjust for your liking. Flip down the canvas or book holder and you are ready to go.There was a tiny dent on the side by the corner of the top part. It doesn't take away from the product.There are two pieces of hardware on the drawer that I at first thought were just decorative. They are supposed to have flip latches but both were missing. I found one in the box but the other was MIA. They had snapped off during shipping I am assuming but they don't take away from the product either as the drawer will not slide out or at least at this time it  is not. Maybe as it gets more use but right now it is tight.It also comes with a paint palette. Love that tooDisclaimer: I received a complimentary product for my honest opinion.

I think that was why I was confused.We appreciated all the little details too. The little pink ribbon skull, the blue bracelets and phones.The Mega Bloks set features Lagoona Blue and Cleo. There are huge speakers a turntable and a table for the girls to sit and have a drink.This is a great set for Monster High fans which we are.We love the dance floor and how the light from the sound skull above, flashes light on the dance floor making it look like a light dance floor.You can add other sets featuring other Monsters and connect them.

"Honestly I wasn't sure how I would feel about a Chromebook. We have always had laptops here but with all of them getting older we needed to consider one and this is the perfect one for our needs.Whenever my 10 year old asked to borrow the computer I always felt like I had to move it, I had to plug it in because it may be too heavy, too cumbersome for her. The Toshiba Chromebooks 2 is incredibly light weight. It is nice and sleek, very compact and since it weights practically nothing I have no fear when I let her carry it around or sit with it at the table.It is really fast as we have cable high speed and it is not bogged down with a million programs running in the background like our computers.The kids do all their homework on here and having a second super fast computer makes everyone happy.We did a quick tutorial and set some fun, kid friendly apps up for the kids to get used to it. Now we have Netflix loaded up and when we need an extra TV we have that too because they can stream whatever they want through the Chromebook.This is so better than spending money on another laptop just to have a second computer in the house. For what they kids need this is absolutely perfect and reasonably priced.  Most people don't use all the features they have on their expensive computers anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZD63P6IMGUQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015806LMM#wasThisHelpful","RZD63P6IMGUQX","AY3EENC2BGTGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3EENC2BGTGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow...just wow... talk about a smart toy!Over the summer we received My Friend Cayla as well as My Friend Teddy.  Cayla is amazing and can literally be a lifelong toy that your child will never grow out of.Due to her speech-to-text technology, Cayla takes what is asked of her, finds it online via Bluetooth where she speaks it back to you.  You do need to have an Android or iOS device so you can sync through Bluetooth but once you are hooked up the possibilities are endless.Cayla's app is easily downloaded and once connected, your child can play with Cayla, listen to her read stories, discuss her photo albums even play games.When you first sync up, you will go into settings and add a bunch of information about your child so that Cayla can communicate with them on a very personal level. Cayla has her own personality, likes and dislikes and pulls from your information to talk to your child.Pros:  Price! I expected a smart toy such as Cayla to be well over $100.00. She is under.  A lifelong toy due to her capabilities and vast knowledge thanks to the internet.  Online Protection - Cayla has a built in predefined list of bad words.  She is a pose-able, adorable doll  Speech-to-text technology  Endless possibilities of play. I asked random questions and she answered more than 90% of them  She only takes 3 AAA batteries  Two toys in one! Not just an app, but a physical doll  Positive role, sweet voice that is always kind, confident and well mannered.  Her technology will only increase due to her connection to an app. As the powers that be change things on their end, so too will Cayla change. Can't wait to see what they come up with next.  The only cost to Cayla is the doll. The app is free! There is no monthly fee to use her.  You can use her as a speaker to play your music through your smartphone.Cons:  If you speak clearly, and are patient, Cayla will answer your questions. My husband was the first to use Cayla on his phone while I figured out what was going on with mine. You can't rapid fire questions at her, you must speak clearly and give Cayla time to find the answer to you. She doesn't have a brain she has a motherboard which allows her to take what you said, input it into her database or the internet and find the answer. You will see in my video that sometimes it did take time but patience always works with Cayla and in life.There is a learning curve. We are all expecting the doll to be mega smart. The technology is there but it is important to remember she is a doll. The first three times we used her, we didn't give her the time she needed to answer. We didn't wait for the heart to blink, it is the only time Cayla can hear you.Speak clearly, be patient, and this doll will amaze you. AND...as for all those endless, random questions your kids ask  you throughout the day; send them to Cayla and let her handle them. She probably knows more than us anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U00UB5FM3T04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010T4JV5G#wasThisHelpful","R1U00UB5FM3T04","AY3EENC2BGTGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3EENC2BGTGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am obsessed with making sure my face is hair free except my eye brows. For some reason I am constantly searching for my tweezer and never can find it. I get these little hairs in my chin and sometimes on my neck that I constantly need to remove. This Precision Grooming set is perfect for being able to control exactly what I need. In face the other day I handed the pointest ones to my 10 year old and asked her to get one on my neck that I couldn't see but could feel.These are stainless steel and come in their own handy kit which makes them super easy to find unlike the one I am always searching for.The ones I got were a beautiful blue. I have yet to try to tweeze a hair that wasn't tweezeable. Every single one so far has come out on the very first attempt. Usually there are those that slip out of the tweezers and have me pulling on air.Yes, the set is extremely pointy. Yes, they could be dangerous but use with precaution knowing that you will remove whatever it is you are trying to remove, a hair or a splinter.  The scissors have the tiniest tip, they are perfect for trimming any hair above my brow line.Favorite set ever and priced as a set so well.I received a complimentary product for my honest opinion.

"Theses Microfiber towels are perfect for so many things besides Yoga. They are amazingly absorbent and thick.I love using when I ride my stationary bike on the handle bars. I don't sweat but my hands do and slide all the time. I place a towel on it and no sliding.My husband takes one to the gym and says he uses it all the time. Mostly on the back of a machine where his head lies. He has no hair and sweats a lot. He hates the fact that he is slipping and leaving sweat everywhere. He told me he feels much more comfortable now and clean up takes way less time.The kids love these towels not only because of the colors but because their hair no longer drips all over their PJ's at night after their showers. The rub these towels on their head before coming out of the bathroom and no more drips!Looks like we need to purchase at least another set.

"Bought this to replace this coffee maker's predecessor as we love the slow brew setting. First one lasted 5-1/2 years which is good for something like this. Not only does the ""aroma"" setting make for tastier coffee, which we notice as we drink coffee black, it also allows for less coffee to be used. A coffee measure that is for ground coffee works well for unground beans at a 1 measure for 1 ""cup"" of coffee. Without the aroma setting I would be using at least 25% more coffee to get the same level of richness.Bitter coffee is the result of the water being too hot and removing alkaloids from the coffee beans and with the aroma setting this is avoided completely.As mentioned the newer model has a carafe with thinner and more fragile glass so care needs to be taken even when the carafe is cold.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RFL3GQYBGV8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TOAM98#wasThisHelpful","R1RFL3GQYBGV8D","A204K1OFE8OB9Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204K1OFE8OB9Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Best single book on cholesterol, heart disease, and statins I have read. It does the best job of covering the biological mechanics involved and does so in a way that a lay person can understand but without being dumbed down. The information provided references studies so anyone who want more detail can easily research further.One aspect that Graveline covers in detail is the FDA's Medwatch database which though poorly organized and categorized can be researched with time and diligence to find thousands of cases of reported physical damage from the use of statins. It is not only that statins provide only a 1.1% gain in absolute numbers for preventing heart attacks but that statins also lead to increases in cancers and diabetes and other factors that lead to disability or death.Information such as Merck having filed a patent for a combination statin and CO Q10 product which shows that this drug company was away of the downsides of statins, is something I have not seen mentioned in any of the books or articles on the subject that I have read. It speaks volumes to the corruption of the health care industry in this country and also to the unique perspective provided by Dr. Graveline.If you only care to read one book on statins or are looking for something to give someone you know is on statins and about whom you care, this is the one to get or give.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRESM3FLX9PMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983383553#wasThisHelpful","RRESM3FLX9PMC","A204K1OFE8OB9Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204K1OFE8OB9Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This light works very well within its limitations. The light beam is very broad at more than 120 degrees and bright enough on the high and often on a lower setting (output is adjustable). It is not truly a work light with its short battery life of 3 hours. If you can get the task done in 3 hours it is OK. If you need something that will provide light for more than 3 hours then you need to get either an 110v AC powered work light or one with user replaceable batteries.Intsun Portable Cordless 24 leds 30W 2400LM 3 modes CREE XM-L Rechargeable LED RGB Flood Spot Light Outdoor Camping Lamp Floodlight, powered by 3PCS 18650 3.7V Rechargeable Lithium Battery, battery included. (24 LED)It is smaller than my halogen work lights and it puts out less than 1% as much heat which helps in confined spaces. A halogen worklight easily becomes a space heater. No worries about getting burned as with the halogen worklights.A battery charge lasts up to 4 hours on a dim setting. It can be powered off the 12v DC brick that could be plugged into 110AC but that makes the light unwieldy and there is no mechanical strain relief so this is not really a solution.There are some aspects that could stand to be improved. For one the On-Off switch is on the bottom of the housing as is the place to press to adjust the light level. Better if they were on the back or top of the housing.Second is that star washers were used where the knobs are screwed into the housing for the handle and bottom support. They do nothing to prevent the handle from flopping around. I have replaced the metal star washers with fiber washers and that helped keep the handle and LED housing in position.Third is the charge indicator is worthless. When the charge is down to nothing the light goes out and if the brick is plugged in to recharge the battery then the LED shows as Red initially and then switches to Green. Whether the charge level of the batteries is zero or 100% the small LED indicator lamp shows Green so there is no way to know what the charge level is or even if it is at 100%.I would recommend this light as a backup light or for use when the 3-4 hour battery life is not a problem. At two-thirds brightness the battery charge lasts for less than 3 hours. For extended work I would recommend one of the LED work lights where the batteries can be removed for charging and a fresh set put in their place.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REVVL6PK30J0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PL9PIT8#wasThisHelpful","REVVL6PK30J0","A204K1OFE8OB9Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204K1OFE8OB9Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The breaking strength according to the Mile Marker website for this thickness of their synthetic rope is 15,000 lbs. or a lot more than is indicated on the product listing here.This is not designed to be used like a snatch strap which makes it a lot safer. Problem with a snatch strap is that if it breaks loose from either vehicle the strap and whatever is on the end of it becomes a potentially lethal projectile. It has taken out many a windshield and not long ago killed a good Samaritan pulling a vehicle that was stuck in the sand at Pismo Beach.It you have two vehicles it is much safer for both of them to use their combined traction with a tow rope to extricate the stuck vehicle.

"I have worked with a number of Epson printers in recent years and am a fan of the brand. This unit was no exception.Epson printers come well packed and with user-friendly unpacking -- there is light blue tape in various places that might wiggle during shipment, each with a tab to make it easy to remove. Plug in, install the ink cartridges, and give it a few minutes to run its setup drill. While this is happening, I went to the Epson site to get the drivers (as a Mac user, I'm often on a machine w/o a CD drive, and it's easy enough to go to the Epson site). I grabbed and installed the scanner driver and then read on the Epson site the info that the printer driver is now delivered through the Apple App Store (free), which is a good improvement. (I didn't need it since I have other Epson printers, and my driver is current). I set up wifi, did the suggested firmware update, and was good to print.As with any small in one, you will have a continued expense with the ink cartridges. Epson have chips in them to try to prevent you from refilling and things like that. Every once in awhile the electronics of the cartridge fails, but you can make a claim with them. It's all kind of annoying, and yet somehow I remain a fan of the printers because they just work and print so nicely. This one is no exception.Pros:1. High-quality double-sided printing2. Copier and scanner, too3. The new EPSON drivers allow printing from mobile devices4. Well packaged for shipping5. Easy setupCons:1. Cost of ink adds up over timeNote: I worked with an XP-610 and have an XP-810 at home right now. I prefer the 8XX series because of the document feeder at the top and I like the larger touchscreen LCD. I don't use the fax that's available on the 8XX series, but I like those other things.

"Since there are few reviews right now for this TV, let me point out that there are more for the Polaroid 50GSR3000 on Amazon. Looking at the Polaroid site, the difference between the FA model (this one) and the non-FA model, the FA model is 60Hz and the non-FA model is 120Hz. They don't have both versions showing up on the Polaroid site right now, but for the 55"" versions, the FA model has an 8ms response time, while the non-FA model has a 5ms response time. (You can google response time and get folks' opinions about that for different uses -- e.g., gamers don't much care for it.)I thought this was going to be too much TV in our little house, but yay, it fits fine, and wow, does it ever look great. My other TV is a Toshiba 46L5200U 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED TV (also from Amazon, almost three years ago), and the Polaroid is so much crisper in the images.I agree with the reviewer who said that instructions are lacking; even just putting the base together was a minor pain. For some stuff, you might find it useful to go to polaroidhdtv dot com to find the user's guide, and will also give you more specs than are here. I will put instructions for assembling the base and more specs from the Polaroid web site in comments below, to keep this from getting too long.I found the TV way too dark immediately out of the box, but after tweaking the brightness and contrast, I'm very very happy with the picture. I also think the sound is fantastic. My Toshiba is hooked up to surround sound, and I haven't done that with the new Polaroid yet, and the sound is surprisingly great for no external speakers. (I see in the reviews for the 50GSR3000 that some folks complained about the sound being wimpy. I dunno.)Pros:1. Great picture, and great sound. Maybe I have just this one pro, but that's what you want out of your TV, right?2. Energy Star rating -- estimated yearly energy cost is $12.Cons:1. Weak instructions.2. 60 Hz. Consider the 50GSR3000 instead... or one of the other screen sizes.3. I agree with the previous reviewer that the scanning for channels is a big drag, but yeah, TVs do that.Other:1. If you go chase down the online manual, you'll see that the inputs are towards the middle of the TV, and not easily accessible from the edges. There are pros and cons to either approach, depending on how your TV is set up, how you want it to look, and how you're going to use it.Again, I'm really delighted with this TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33WXNTHIE3OIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MIPWD4#wasThisHelpful","R33WXNTHIE3OIQ","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this bag, but it's just a little bit too small. It will just barely fit 8.5 x 11-inch papers, which means that they're hard to get in and out. But it'll work.

"Amazon tells me that I got this April 7, 2012I picked this tray for two reasons: because I like the bamboo and because I have a LOT of flatware, and it's capacious. I am not disappointed by those two things. I am disappointed because it's not made very well. I am regluing it today, or trying to, which leads me to visit Amazon and write a review.Pros:1. I do like the bamboo, quite a bit. It makes me happy2. I have a space-crunched kitchen, and this fits well in the top drawer3. I think I have service for 16 (two 8-person sets), plus some extra pieces like iced tea spoon, and this holds it all. Maybe I have service for 20, even, come to think of it.Cons:1. Everything is a little bit warped. I'm pretty sure it was when I got it, but it certainly is now. This make the regluing effort a bit questionable.2. What led me to reglue is that table knives started sliding underneath, out of their official bin. (This did, of course, over time, lead to increased wedging. FWIW, I have for years now just slid the knives back out and popped the dividers back into place, but the knives want what the knives want, and they do it again. Today, I had enough silverware in the dishwasher that I decided it was a good day to try to reglue.3. The back piece appears to be a veneer, so who knows what I'm gluing to, anyway.4. Whether over the course of time or initially shoddy construction, the dividers will not meet flush with the base. I was initially trying to glue and clamp and gave that up. I did try that for a few hours, and then decided to treat it more like caulking with my Elmer's: I am trying to make a barrier that will prevent the knives from slipping underneath again and continually wedging things up.Four stars because I still love the wood of this, the depth, and that it fits so well in my drawer. As I was hoping, it's a good use of the space that I have, and it's classy, even with all its flaws.FWIW, I have gotten over the need to have one specific item in each compartment. In the longest bin on the left, I have serving spoons, pushed towards the top, and iced tea spoons, pushed towards the bottom. In the next compartment, I have the knives, which was probably the worst choice for them, giving the wedging behavior, and I might rearrange when I refill the drawer. Next, I have forks, the real dinner forks. On the far right, I have the regular spoons at the top of the bin and the teaspoons at the bottom of the bin. I have almost no use for desert forks, so I put those across the top, in the smaller bin that goes sideways. And I can't easily reach the very top bin, so very seldom used things go there. I gather my intermingling of different types of silverware is a disappointment to some readers, but it really works well for me. Again, I am space crunched, and this is the optimal solution. I will probably swap the knives and the spoons when I refill the drawer, since this will give the knives less opportunity to escape. I think.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FQVK9KKEDK9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MM8T2W#wasThisHelpful","R3FQVK9KKEDK9Z","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have a huge head (23 or 24"" hat size), and these are uncomfortably tight for me. They need the pressure to do their thing of course, but need to either come in sizes or be adjustable.2. They don't always work well with eyeglasses. They work fine with my metal frames, which don't have a lot of bulk near my ears. But they bump up against my plastic frames, which have broader earpieces.

It's not yet available, but there will be resources specific to this kit available at littlebits dot cc slash ggkit3. Once you've decided you're on the littleBits path, you'll want to decide which is the best kit for you. There is a comparison chart at littlebits dot cc slash shop slash compare-kits -- again, as I write this, this kit is not yet mentioned there.In this kit:1. There are 15 ""bits"" -- the core electronic pieces that snap together to make things. I will list them below2. There are instructions to make 10+ projects (plus, because there are variations and there are/will be more available online)3. There's a bag full of extra things you need -- Lego-like boards for holding things together, wheels, batteries, glue dots, velcro, ...)4. There's a bag with cardstock (paper) pieces needed for some projects (and/or templates), and stickers for decorating things, including printable labels.5. There's an instruction book.LittleBits divides the primary components into four categories: Power, Input, Wire (connections), and Output. These are color-coded to blue, pink, orange, and green, respectively. I was wondering how this compared to the ""Deluxe Kit"" when I picked it, so I'll use that as a point of comparison for the provided core componentsThe 15 littleBits included in this kit are:POWER  2 power bits  (1 in deluxe kit)INPUT  2 slide dimmers (1 in deluxe kit)  1 light sensor (none in deluxe kit)WIRE 1 wire (4 in deluxe kit)  1 wireless transmitter (none in deluxe kit)  1 wireless receiver (none in deluxe kit)  1 split (none in deluxe kit)OUTPUT 1 buzzer (1 in deluxe kit)  2 dc motors (1 in deluxe kit)  1 servo and hub (1 in deluxe kit? it's called a ""servo"" there, so maybe a different part)  1 fan (0 in deluxe kit)If I've kept track of everything correctly, the additional parts that the deluxe kit has that this one does are INPUT: 1 button, 1 pulse, 1 sound trigger, 1 timeout; WIRE: 1 fork (maybe the same as my ""split""?), 1 inverter, 1 latch; OUTPUT: 1 light wire, 1 rgb led. The Deluxe Kit includes 18 ""bits"" in total, while again, this Gizmos and Gadgets Kit includes 15 in total.I'm currently of the impression that while there's some overlap, there's a number of obvious differences, too, and that somewhere down the road, these two kits might be wonderful complements to each other. I don't have the Deluxe Kit, so I'm not sure, but the one in my hands feels like an amazing introduction to this whole path and an excellent starting point.Pros:1. Amazing, amazing educational toy that makes doing these technical things accessible, appealing, and exciting for young learners.2. 10 guided projects and huge room to explore/design/create other projects oneself3. An active online community encourages sharing of ideas, questions, and accomplishments4. You can download Avery templates for printing on the labels -- nice!5. I really love that there is nothing that hints at gender hereCons:1. My only gripe is the way they did the project book, which has staples on the left edge (not with folded longer sheets and staples down the middle, but a stack of single sheets with three staples along the edge). This is not going to wear well. My suggestion is to immediately fold 1/4"" up or back along that edge to try to make it ""know where to open to"" and have a bit of a longer life span. Otherwise, the pages are going to start ripping soon.Other:1. The card-stock things, of course, are going to get spent and used up. I think having them as examples is important to the creative process and then your kids will need to come up with alternative means of accomplishing the same thing. I don't currently see a better solution (so I'm not calling this a ""con""); maybe they will provide refill packs.I'm laughing to myself right now because we've been working on clearing old stuff out of the house and it turns out I have my son's old electronics kit in a pile right across the room from me. Although he is a very technical person (he's now an engineering major in college), I could never get him to play around with me and the electronics kit. There was a barrier to understanding what was possible and what was cool about it, and a steep learning curve until you ""got it"". Littlebits erases the step up to the accessibility of electronics. I am entirely in awe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15LWDCOVDJN08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147YATSW#wasThisHelpful","R15LWDCOVDJN08","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a fan of Epson printers and have worked with several. The others are ""home office"" type all-in-ones, and this is the first one that I wouldn't use at home and will use at work. But it has all the great features I'm used to, plus a number of great things I wasn't even expecting.My previous work printer was an HP 4700 (or something close to it). That was a workhorse printer, and as near as I can tell, this Epson WorkForce is it's match -- plus, the Epson has a number of modern features that mean that it's a much better printer to work with.As others have described, this is a big heavy thing, and the only real question to my mind is whether you have enough space for it. The side wings that enable the long-lived ink supply mean that this really takes up a lot of room. As with my other Epsons, this comes enormously well packed, with blue tape tabs holding things securely for shipping, but easily eye catching and easily removable once its in your hands. The instructions were straightforward for putting in the ink cartridges and other minor setup things, and you will need to install printer drivers on your computers, and then you're good to go.Pros:1. Great print, copy, and scan quality (I don't use a fax, so I can't comment on that).2. Multiple connectivity options, including network (ethernet), wifi, wifi direct, USB, and Google Cloud3. Reasonably well designed interface on color touch screen for setting options4. Ink that lasts for a remarkably long time.5. I kind of expect double-sided printing at this point, and yes, this has it.6. I have gotten spoiled by Epson's wireless scanning (to my device) in the past, and this will continue to spoil me.Cons:1. The only drawback I can see to this printer is its large footprint. Again, it's a regular large-size work printer, but then has the earmuffs for the plentiful ink. (I see that there's another version of this with a different ink system if the size of the printer is an issue.)Basically, I love everything about this printer, and am delighted to have it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKTFZXEPECS72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JFF0#wasThisHelpful","RKTFZXEPECS72","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are so many things to love about this product.Pros:1. Human-grade food for your pooch. I feel so good about that.2. Also, responsible ingredients, including the wild-caught pollock3. My dog couldn't wait to eat it from the moment I opened the box4. Low-impact packaging. The notion of ""add water"" dog food is entirely new to me. I have bought some dog food from amazon in the past and I always feel so bad about how much packaging and labor is involved in getting it to me. This is a lot less of those things for moist food in the end, even.Cons:1. This can't sit around, like dry food does. My dog ate it immediately, but that's not her usual behavior. Usually, she nibbles over a stretch of time.2. Inside the box are two plastic bags (4lb. version); you need to cut these open and then find a way to reseal them till you've used things up. I just used a binder clip.3. I have also tried the grain-free turkey version, and this one -- not surprisingly -- stinks of fish.Other:1. I don't usually give my dog wet food, so that part is strange to me. Also, the having to wait part.2. My dog will ""eat anything"", but she also lets her displeasure be known when it's not something she was hoping for. Again, as soon as I opened the bag, I had her interest. She doesn't usually do this at meal time, and doesn't attack the food when I give it to her like most dogs do. She was very attentive as I was making this, and ate it immediately. (Since people are mentioning their breeds... she is a shelter dog, so I don't know, but certainly part lab and maybe part chow. )I am very happy to have discovered the Honest Kitchen dog foods, and am now feeding my pup about 50-50 this and her regular kibble.I really appreciate this product and hope I get used to the mixing part and that my dog continues to love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V27QG9T4Z2UG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZBI9DD6#wasThisHelpful","R3V27QG9T4Z2UG","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't even have a spiralizer and I love this book.What I have is an allergy to grains and a lot of veggies from the CSA (community-supported agriculture -- I pay for veggies every week, but don't pick what I get). I often run the squash through the grater on my Cuisinart and end up with a similar base for foods. For me, this cookbook provides a wealth of suggestions for what to do with that grated squash, which does start to get a little tiring after a while. And it's also has inspiring ideas for many other vegetables as well.As you know there are four main sections of recipes here: gluten-free, paleo, vegetarian and vegan, and raw food. Some of the recipes fit into other categories than the one they're in, so there's quite a bit to chose from for anyone on one or more of these restrictive diets.My only criticism is that there aren't enough pictures.... but the ones that are there are well done.(This cookbook is encouraging me to get a spiralizer, but in the meantime, grating is working fine for me.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EJ8Z2DHOBO37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778805220#wasThisHelpful","R2EJ8Z2DHOBO37","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love teal and was eyeing this bag for a long time before I decided to go for it. It is a very nice bag, and I'm glad I did.Note that it's 7""x10"", not 8""x10"" as currently listed on Amazon.Pros:1. Perfect deep teal color.2. Heavy, high-quality leather3. Loads of pockets to help keep things organized: back outside, front inside (just under the flap), slender inside pocket behind that, and then the main compartment has a zipper pocket on one side and an open stash pocket on the other side.4. Adjustable-length shoulder strap.Cons:1. I am tall, and to wear this messenger style, the strap is a little short... but it still works.Other:1. I couldn't tell online, but the buckle on the front is for show and conceals a magnetic clasp underneath. Similarly, the back pocket is not entirely open and has a small magnetic claspI was fortunate enough to get this bag at a considerable discount from its current price on Amazon and other sites, so I'm feeling pretty lucky about that. (Oh, I get it. I actually bought it from Amazon, but now it's only third-party sellers.)Among the things I most love about this bag is that I can expect to have it for years because it's such nice leather and so well made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLRBJJVMLKTXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5T59QS#wasThisHelpful","RLRBJJVMLKTXM","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to regularly feed my dog Eagle Pack, but moved and never found a seller in my new town. I didnt realize till today that Amazon carries it though maybe they didnt, a few years ago.Anyway, thats my primary comparison to the Wellness CORE food.I think both companies make products that are particularly targeted toward healthy food for our pets. Most of us looking at these sorts of brands are aware that the food streams for humans in our country are sketchy, with questionable additives and questionable farming practices; its the same, of course, for our dogs.The Eagle Pack is cheaper on Amazon, but it also relies on rice and other grains. This relies instead on potatoes for starch. There are downsides to both of those choices. As you might know, all rice grown in the US contains some amount of arsenic, which is implicated in cancer and auto-immune diseases. Its a naturally occurring substance, but historically was used as a pesticide, so in some fields it has been added. Rice soaks it up like a sponge, so it ends up in our food supply. Potatoes are less of a concern on my list, but you might not know that nightshades (which includes potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers) are implicated in rheumatoid arthritis. As my girl ages, this is something I think about.I should mention as well that my dog loves this, but the truth is that she just loves food, so that doesnt mean much. And even though I put out a bowl of this and the other kibble I had on hand (Trader Joes, cause Id run out), and she picked this she will fairly consistently pick anything new over anything familiar, so I still dont know that it means anything. But she doesnt hate it, I can assert that!This is an excellent product, and Im happy to have had the opportunity to try it. Its also wonderful to see that its available via Subscribe and Save, so I can get the 15% discount and not have to lug the heavy bag back from the store.

"Most of us are aware of the growing crisis in our healthcare system, but might not understand the breadth of this nor how to navigate the broken system when we need healthcare. This is such a wonderful book to learn about both.I'm not usually a fan of books that are full of anecdotes, but in this book each one is used to provide a very clear example that is anchored in the experience of the author, and many are backed up with references or resources.The book unfolds through three parts (each with mutiple chapters) that give advice on how to select and work with your primary care physician, how to escalate to an expert and deal with an emergency, and how to cope with a serious illness. The end of each chapter has a nice summary of the points in that chapter to recap.)A constant message throughout is that you should be an informed consumer of your medical care, that you should keep track of your own (and family members) medical history, and that you need to advocate for yourself and inform yourself.Since we all need medical care even in the broken system, this is a book for all of us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H0FZ800RRF6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038535228X#wasThisHelpful","R2H0FZ800RRF6M","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic cellphone case. It's just a little bit thicker than the black jelly case I was using before, but offers more protection against drops.Pros:1.

"This is far and away my favorite hair coloring. You couldn't find it for a stretch there, and I was buying it from off merchants when I could find it, and now I'm so excited to see that Amazon is selling it again.My hair is naturally what I've long called dirty dishwater strawberry blond and a friend more poetically called the color of honey. It's a reddish dark blond or maybe a light auburn, but isn't a fiery carrot top of any shade. For me, this covers (or disguises?) the gray that's creeping in and kicks up the red a bit.When I was unable to find this and trying to find ""my shade"" in other brands (hopeless), I was always embarrassed to be near other people just after a coloring because it all stinks so much. Not to mention what the hell am I doing to myself with those harsh chemicals. (For some brands, the included conditioner smells like fake coconut and that's a smell I particularly detest; the conditioner here is more of a neutral scent.)This won't be for everyone because it's not ""permanent"", but for me, I like that it gradually fades out and doesn't leave a line with the new growth. And I also like that it doesn't make my hair a monotone color... it adds color and leaves natural variation, and I think the result is very natural looking. For me, I try not to leave it on too long or it ends up a little redder than I'd like most of the time.FWIW, I have very long hair but just use one box. I do all the wrong things and color just after shampooing, so my hair is still wet from that. Plus, of course, the ends don't need much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FFQXZKUT7GXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1DRNGO#wasThisHelpful","R1FFQXZKUT7GXM","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love marcasite and sterling jewelry, and was excited to give these a try. I find them a little disappointing, but mostly a lot of fun. Now that I have it in my hands, the marcasites are smaller and stingier than I think they should be, and the silver is too whitePros:1. Fun baubles that look a lot like they're presented here.2. Marcasite and sterling silver, though the red part is glass.3. Not ""too heavy"", though definitely heavier than most other earrings I wear.4. Come in the lovely black with blue accents Amazon Collection box, so they are nice gifts.Cons:1. I think the design is a little quirky, and I don't quite get the swirly shapes on the back.2. I don't know what Amazon does with their sterling silver. It's very white, and sterling naturally has a warmer tone.3. I wish these were lever backs; I find the hooks and the plastic keepers don't look as nice to my mind. In this case, the wires look sort of cheap next to the rest of the earring, because they are relatively thin wires as compared to the relatively solid earrings.4. I am confused by the pricing on these; currently $46.25. These should be maybe $25 or $30.Other:1. The listing is off, saying 38 marcasite stones in one place and 8 marcasite stones in another. I think there are 23 stones in each earring and 46 total.2. As with the other Amazon Collection sterling items I've gotten, they are stamped on the back with ""PAJ 925"" and ""China"". Googling tells me that 925 refers to the maker; 925 of course refers to the silver, and China, of course, is the country of manufacture.I took the picture attached here both to compare with an more ""classic"" marcasite and to compare to the size of a quarter (and to show the little plastic earring back that comes with each earring). The older earring has had a chance to develop a patina, but I'm not sure the Amazon one ever will. It just seems like the metal is coated or treated somehow, and I wish Amazon were straightforward about what they're doing with their sterling.I think they're fun earrings, but they are a little disappointing, too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BQBJ41JCA6TN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C20OJ12#wasThisHelpful","R1BQBJ41JCA6TN","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've now tried three different keyboard cases for my iPad Air 2, and I don't think this is my favorite. It's a solid case and has a nice flat and responsive keyboard like Macs. I am not crazy about the way that the iPad is set in from the outer edge of the case, which seems to make everything bigger than it needs to be. However, it doesn't have a full keyboard, which won't matter to almost anyone reading this, but for me, it doesn't have an escape key, and that turns out to be something that geeky me needs to use when traveling (when accessing remote unix machines). For normal people, though, this is a pretty excellent case.Pros:1. Solid keyboard, with keys that are evocative of the lovely sleek Mac keyboard keys.2. Cutouts in all the right places3. Easy enough (but not too easy) to get the iPad in and out.4. The closed case has a reasonably nice aesthetic, to my mind... my favorite of the three cases. To me, it's the best suited to the aesthetic of the iPad itself... I would really love to find a case that's Apple-like and very sleek; the iPad Air 2 itself is so lovely and any keyboard case I've seen just stomps all over that. Le sigh.5. Has nice F and J bumps to find homerow without looking.Cons:1. No escape key. When I looked at this online, I was just checking for cases that have six full rows of keys and didn't check carefully enough about particular keys. Very few users will care about this.2. Can't adjust the angle of the screen relative to the keyboard, as you can with some cases.3. This is rather awkward to fold back the keyboard and just read from the tablet. It doesn't comfortably4.

"I used to always carry tiny purses, but larger phone sizes and the need for reading glasses mean that most of them are too small any more. This is a perfect size for those two essentials, plus some money, credit cards, etc.Pros:1. Accordion design -- there are three main compartments -- allow for expandability when needed (although stuffed would look weird).2. Reasonable price for what it is.3. Handy wrist strap, which is easily removable if you prefer a clutch.4. Gold chain provided, if you prefer a shoulder bag or cross-body bag. I am tall and this is plenty long for cross-body wear. Obviously at this price point, it's not a very nice chain and is sort of plastic-y5. Really nice set of pockets. There are the three main compartments.

"I got these not because I wanted business cards (right now?), but because I wanted to use them as gift tags and the like.Avery is great about providing templates for their products, and I've always been pleased to find the templates. I found the site hard to navigate to find the business card templates I needed, but eventually figured out how to move around and sample some designs of interest.You'll need to make sure you understand your printer to do two sided printing. I was frustrated that I didn't find a template that had both sides as one document; instead I had to get paired 'page 1"" and ""page 2"". I have a two-sided printer, so this seems a bit silly (and I guess I don't know how to use Word well enough to combine the two docs). You might want to do a test run on a regular sheet of paper to know what side is going to get printed on. For my printer (an Epson 810), a printed side one needs to be face up in the paper tray to print the next side face down.The cards don't quite separate cleanly, though you don't want them to separate too easily, of course, or they'll come apart in your printer. I imagine this is the right mix of sturdy and separable.All in all, isn't it wonderful that we can print our own cards. And these are a pretty nifty product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DH92HPPOW7LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008XPHB#wasThisHelpful","R3DH92HPPOW7LE","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have recently found the Vega line and am impressed with their products, including this one.Previous to trying Vega products, I used greens supplements, such as GreensPlus or PaleoGreens, and I still appreciate those products for greens. The Vega products I've tried -- this and the chocolate protein and greens drink mix -- also have protein and so, they can pass for a meal, and in particular, seem to work pretty well for me for an occasional breakfast.My only big gripe is that I don't generally favor sweet drinks, and I picked the ""natural"" flavor, hoping they would leave out the Stevia. No such luck; it's still sweeter than I would like.Pros:1. Non-GMO, non dairy, non soy (the major source of the protein is peas), vegan2. 20g protein, 6 servings of greens, vitamins and minerals, fiber, and even probiotics3. easy to mix4. tastes fineCons:1. Too sweet for my tastes2. A wee bit gritty, but very minimal for a product like this3. Doesn't stay well suspended, and I have to keep stirring, but again, that's fine for this type of product.My cons are not necessarily yours of course, and I do think this is a wonderful product.Note for those who think this is expensive: Have a look at PaleoGreens and/or GreensPlus to get a sense of what high-quality greens supplements cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQSXD08F2U0TF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0Y12VA#wasThisHelpful","RQSXD08F2U0TF","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unsurprisingly, this is a great little gadget. The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't have Amazon Prime.As you know, this fits into the same niche as Roku or Fire TV. I have a Roku and a Fire stick as points of comparison.Aside from not having Prime Movies, this is clearly the best of the bunch because of the added ability to ""cast"" from your laptop or phone to the TV screen. Awesome! (Because of the missing Prime, I'm still going to be using that Roku regularly.)I think it is strange that they don't include instructions in the box, but of course you can google that up.

"I have become the queen of over-the-door racks since moving into a house that has only one proper closet. I had five over-the-door racks in my house and one at work before getting this one to try out. (On the back of three bedroom doors, on the inside of the door of the one closet, and on the back of the kitchen door, which, following the time-honored Maine tradition, is the primary entry to the house.)The biggest problem with choosing an over-the-door rack that's going to work for you is knowing that you're buying something that will work with the thickness of your door. Standard/traditional interior doors are 1-3/8' thick, while standard/traditional exterior doors are 1-3/4"" thick. For most over-the-door hooks, if you get one for a thinner door than you have, you can't get it over the door. If you get one for a wider door than you have, it doesn't work, either. (Initially surprising, but if it's not the right size, it sort of starts to fall off, and it's no longer flush across the top and you can't close the door.) This clever design will accommodate both of those widths, and of course, anything in between.(Note that at work, I have a 1-3/4"" interior door, and exterior doors can be as wide as 2-1/4""... so you will still want to measure before ordering.)I don't think this would work well for doors less than 1-3/8"", but it should work for doors up to 1-7/8"" -- that's the spacing between the vertical plastic pieces at the top.Another thing to consider is the clearance at the top between your door and the door frame. I can't put this on the back of my front door because there's not enough clearance there, though it works fine at my kitchen door. If you have a clearance problem, you might fare better with hooks that have a metal brace across the top... That style is usually much thinner than this plastic version.Oh! it's also possible that due to the thickness of the plastic, you're not going to like the way the door closes when it hits the jamb. In other words, maybe there's enough clearance at the top, but not between the top front of the door and the inner jamb the door meets up with.This is just shy of 20.5 inches wide and it's 7.5 inches high.Another thing to consider is what you'll be hanging up. The rubber-coated hooks on these will help protect clothing.I can't think of anything else that are ""gotchas"" when buying these things... everything else is sort of aesthetics and obvious functionality. Do you like the way the hooks look and do you want single hooks or double hooks?I'm giving this four stars because it solves the pesky problem of variable door widths (within the stated range), but the thicker plastic on the top means that it won't work on my bathroom door, as I was hoping. (It does work fine for other doors in the house.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSH7VMAK2OV8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034MWFBI#wasThisHelpful","RSH7VMAK2OV8U","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For reference, my favorite bluetooth speakers are Bravens. I have tried a few of those at work (e.g., 600 and 570) and always been pleased. That's not a fair comparison to this, since it's a larger speaker. However, the HP Roar Mini still compares well.I've used this mini HP Roar for both listening to music and for participating in a conference call. and for the price and the size, it's great. There is an advantage to the smaller size, of course, that it's not going to take up much space, either on your desk or in your bag if you're travelling with it. Also, the smaller speaker has a longer battery life.Pros:1. For the current Amazon price ($44), this is a a good balance between the quality of the sound and functionality and the price.2. It's aesthetically pleasing, including especially the speaker itself, and also the back.3. You can also plug in an external device directly if you prefer.4. Relatively easy to set up and use.5. It comes with a little bag, but see the cons section.Cons:1. The instructions are very minimal, but everything works as expected. This would be more confusing to someone who hadn't used a Bluetooth speaker before, though.2. The little bag is too small. It just exactly fits around the speaker, which means a. it's hard to get the speaker in and out, b. one end of the speaker remains exposed, and c. it's hard (but possible!) to also store the charging cable in the bag. Also, the bag is a mesh. So it will help keep some things off the speaker (e.g., dust or cat hair), but not all things (e.g., grit or sand). I do kind of like that it's stretchy, though.Indifferents:1. To be clear, this is not the best sound you're going to get out of a portable speaker, but that's because it's small. I think the quality is better than one would expect at this size, thus my rating.This is a great little speaker, and would make a nice gift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E7V592JMIYGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVV140K#wasThisHelpful","R1E7V592JMIYGA","ASFW4ZMNZJKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFW4ZMNZJKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm giving this five stars because yes, it's the same active ingredients in the same percentages as Frontline Plus, so it is ""the same thing"" as claimed and available at Amazon, which is a win.I had previously thought that flea and tick meds had to be bought from the vet, so learning that these products are available at Amazon is  wonderful news to me. I tried to do some googling to learn what had changed, and found this: ""EPA-registered spot-on products are in fact available as ""non-restricted use"" products that are commercially available through a wide variety of sellers - the EPA does not determine who can sell these non-restricted use products, and there is no ""over the counter"" vs. prescription classification of pesticide products. Basically, it's up to the manufacturer to determine how they want to distribute their product."" (That was via AMVA dot org.) Part of the thing here is that these are not categorized as medicinal. They're categorized as pesticides.I also learned from that site that the pesticides used in ""spot on"" flea and tick treatments for dog are under an EPA investigation, due to reports of adverse effects in dogs. This includes the ingredients in this product (and Frontline Plus) as well as the different pesticides in Vectra 3D, which my vet had recently switched me over to. (In my reading, the adverse effects are markedly more likely for puppies and smaller dogs.)Sentry fiproguard Plus and Frontline Plus for this weight class have the following active ingredients:Fiprornil 9.80%(S)-methoprene 8.80%Vectra 3D hasDinotefuran 4.95%Pyriproxyfen 0.44%Permethrin 36.08%Vectra 3D is both a repellant and a killer, and the repellant characteristics are why it is preferred by many people. In the reading I just did, some folks use both products, on a staggered schedule (one or the other, every two weeks).My dog and I have both had Lyme disease at this point, and I am hoping not to repeat that. So, although I am concerned about the potential adverse effects of the pesticides, I am more concerned about the critters, and I think I will adopt the staggered schedule of the two different products.Anyway, for this product:Pros:1. Available online / from Amazon2. Yes, same chemicals as Frontline PlusCons:1.

"Okay, so you buy something like this because you're silly, and the color makes you happy. Guilty as charged. It's lovely glittery green, and yes, it makes me happy.But then you worry that it's all style and no substance and that doesn't seem to be the case here. It's very solid, including the jack points. And yes, it will charge your phone. My only complaint is that it smells totally weird, heavily perfume-y. I charge my phone in my kitchen and find that an especially annoying scent.Pros:1. Gorgeous.2. Sturdy.3. Charges your phone.Cons:1. Smells perfume-y or incense-y -- strongly. I've tried wiping it off with a damp rag, but no luck yet. (Ah! Windex worked better.)The sparkly color is a very happy-making thing for me, so I'm glad I got this.I will use this as my primary charging cable, and will update if something goes wrong.

"I am using this rod at work, where afternoon sun is too bright for the light-duty shade that is already in the office window. (Strange to say that there's too much sun in the winter, but for me to work on the computer, it was just not good). I have very lightweight curtains up there (chambray voile from the Company Store).The stainless look is perfect for the aluminum-framed windows at work, and in general, I do like the aesthetics of this. I first tried to use a standard white tension rod, but it bowed out enough that it kept falling down. So far, so good with this one.I am concerned that even with the lightweight curtains, the rod bows a bit. Note that I'm towards the outer ends of the span this is supposed to work for, and if you've got more like a 60-inch window, it will likely work much better. Most curtain rods that cover a long span like this have a center support. I liked that this one didn't have that, but yeah, there's a reason that most long curtain rods have a center support. I might try to figure out how to rig something up.Don't be an idiot like me. I was trying to figure out how to get the curtains onto the rod, and pulled the two pieces apart at the middle. It all went back together, but that's not what's intended. Instead, the flat end pieces will screw off, a much better approach.If you care: This product is made in China.Update: six months later... this has been working great for me. No problems whatsoever.

"Just providing another data point here.I have been using Roku for years, and got this for the little TV in the guest room since I didn't want to spend a lot.Like the Roku, it works well in the sense that you can use the internet to stream content from places like Amazon Prime or Netflix. (I use internet services for TV and movies, and don't pay Time-Warner for TV cable service.)Things that are wrong:1. Once something is playing, mine hiccups from time to time, skipping a moment of content.2. The interface is amazingly terrible. I always think Hulu is bad, but this is even worse. Amazingly, it's especially bad with accessing Amazon content. I can't imagine what they were thinking.With the Amazon content on the Roku, I can easily navigate to my Watchlist for TVs or Movies. Here -- WTF? -- the movies and TV shows end up in the same listing.The bad user interface is a software issue, so I'm hoping that Amazon will step it up and we'll get updates and the usability of the device will increase.The hiccuping, I'm not sure; maybe it's a firmware thing that can be addressed with an update, or maybe I got a defective unit.

"This is a great little blender, just what it should be for the price. I'm using it to make smoothies, but it's easy to see how it could tackle other small mixing jobs well.A clever thing about this design is the way that the blade fits first onto the food jar, is then inverted, and placed on the motor. While this means that you can't add things from the top as you would a normal blender, it enables walking away with your drink... or if you're using it for soups or cooking ingredients, easily schlepping things to the stove -- or to the fridge, for storage.Pros:1. Small counter footprint for small jobs.2. Clever design with the inverted jars.3. Easy to swap in standard mason jars.4. Two sets of jars included, and more available for sale if you want them.Cons:0. This is as great as I was expecting, and I don't have any.Indifferents:1. This is just a preference thing, but I find the black drink lids weird -- there's just too much plastic there in your face when you're drinking. So I just end up drinking straight out of the jar.2. Yes, it's only one speed, that's part of the price point. I think it works fine.Note:As the instructions indicate, and as is true of blenders and food processors, you need to have enough liquid in the container so that the solid ingredients can move around.I'm a fan of green smoothies, so I'm usually running vegetables through this and/or protein-powder shakes.

"This is an EXTERIOR SHIELDED CABLE/WIRE, with NO CLOTH.What that means, is that you have a webbed outer jacket over a PVC inner jacket over the actual single wire you usefor hook up.It is heavy. splitting the outer shield web away from the inner PVC for tinning/attaching to wire, or terminal/lead, is a royal pain (I believe this is where the ""plastic melting"" comments come from).Again, this is an OUTER SHIELD wire that may come in contact with other wires, and ground them out.As far as I am concerned, the only good thing about this wire, is that it will give you almost a 100% shield; if you don't need that (and I don't know any applications that come to mind that do), you would be better served using the 22-Ga Rickenbacker Style Pre-tinned Grey Wire  from MojoTone which you buy per foot at about the same price. This is a double jacketed wire with an easy to get to shield wire between the two jackets, and has the same gauge wire in the middle. You can also get Tensility wire from Digi-Key that comes in pre-cut rolls (1 meter, 5meters, Etc.) and uses product numbers like T12**-*-ND; The asterisk's is where 22, 24, or 26 gauge, and length are defined.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V1H08Y9GKO3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FL8SBG#wasThisHelpful","R3V1H08Y9GKO3Y","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using these filters with my upgraded intex 1000 gal pump, for about five years in my 1500 gal. exercise iPool.While the iPool is small, after a few dust storms, and fires (I live in the desert), I was not able to get the water clear, even if I put ina new filter, so I finally had to pump out a portion of the water as I vacuumed out the bottom, Via the pump inlet to the pool.THIS IS THE ONLY METHOD THAT WORKS 100%, other than emptying the pool.I have read of other people being able to use pantyhose to filter out what the type A filter does not, but this does not make ANYsense at all, as the filter has a much finer weave than pantyhose do???? I have actually tried this method, and all I get is a largecloud of silt forming outside of the pantyhose. I have used thick white cotton athletic socks for this purpose with half way decent results, as what you get is a dirty looking sock, which is the silt.  As far as adding something like diatomaceous earth to coat the filter, this just seems like a recipe for disaster, in that your pump could be overworked due to the blockage, and stop working!These filters will last for years (not weeks or months), if cleaned out on a regular basis.  I have no experience leaving these filters forweeks without cleaning, and this my result in you having to replace them, especially if you are just to lazy to clean them out byspraying them off with a garden hose spray nozzle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ZR3TV21NUEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CCJ9GO#wasThisHelpful","R20ZR3TV21NUEM","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For a basswood body guitar, this guitar is heavy.  It is actually heavierthan my roadcore 320M, which has a mahogany body.  This makes no sense atall, accept, it makes you start to wonder if ibanez is just using whatever wood is available atthe time to make their roadcore guitars.I am not a big fan of rosewood fretboards, and this guitar backs up my trepidation of this wood, asit has an alarming tendency to shrink over time, and expose fret ends.  Again, we are assuming ibanezis using rosewood.The guitar is right on the edge of finger rash, and hopefully a couple of fret oil treatments will help.The three Core-Tone pickups and 5 way selector switch give you a large selection of sounds,and the pickups perform surprisingly well, which, in my experience of late is a positive trend ibanez is heading in.I would not pay full retail on this guitar (and did not), but as a three single pup guitar, it plays well, with no fret buzz, andis comfortable to hold.The 330T is out of production and replaced with a different color guitar (430T), but made exactly like this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQLFSJJ5HC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I03T2EO#wasThisHelpful","RIQLFSJJ5HC6","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My first PH3-12R-03 went into operation in 2011. I had no problems with this unit until last night 07/16/15 when it started to makea shrieking sound. This was fixed with a thorough cleaning. (See Addendum for fix/cleanup.)This unit is a better heater than a cooler, but for a small room (I use it in my 190 sq.ft. bedroom) it does an OK job at a low price.I would not try to use this unit in anything over 300 sq. ft.With any portable air conditioner, you must keep the exhaust hose as short as possible, and if you can, insulate it.  You also must keep the room as air tight as possible just like your whole house conditioners,  for best results.I bought a second unit in 2012, as a back up, and tested it when it came in, and everything worked.The unit was covered up, and put away in a closet. I pulled the unit out early in 2014, and the compressor did not come on, so what I had was  fan only. I tested the run capacitor and it was OK. I got further into the unit, and found out that the Solenoid coil and 4 way valve are made by Sanhua, and the scroll compressor is made by Shanghai Highly (Hitachi), and looks like a custom unit that you can only get in China. As stated, the origin of the PH3-12R-03,  is China, so Soleus air is ONLY a reseller, and buys these wholesale from China.  This may be the reason for the terrible service, as they REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING, SINCE THEY DON'T MAKE THEM!  As other reviewers have stated, the help you get from Soleus air is pitiful.When you call (the only way to contact them other than mail) and if you get through, you are assigned a number, called back, and taken through a list of questions like ""is the filter dirty"" when you have just told them that the unit may be two years old, but is in new condition, as it has never been used, which told me that I was talking to a drone on the other end of the line.The return shipping is totally up to you, so my second (non working) unit is pretty much for parts unless I go ahead and use a piercing saddle service valve (sold by Amazon) and charge it with R410A, in hopes this brings it back to life.Between the two units,  maybe I can keep one up and running at all times.I am running a Koldfront AP12000S-1 as backup, that I picked up JUST FOR THIS REASON.The AP12000S-1 actually cools better than the PH3-12R-03.Addendum: 07/26/15I removed the panels on my working unit, and thoroughly brushed and blew out four years of grime and dust throughout the unit, but especially the coils and fins which were close to completely blocked, even though, I actually run two air register filters on the outside, in addition to the piddly slide out filters that come with the unit . The unit is actually pretty easy to clean, and this should be done at least every 2 to 3 years. Panel removal is as follows: (1) Remove 6 screws from front panel sides and tip forward.  (2) Remove 2 screws from black top cover, and then use a dead blow, or rubber mallet and tap the cover off, as it is held on via 6 plastic fingers on the underside of the cover. (3) Remove the remaining screws from the sides and back of the unit, and then take off the two sides.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BK3E2XTSSWQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008OE98IO#wasThisHelpful","R1BK3E2XTSSWQJ","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stopped buying the Club C (classic) once I found basically the same shoe (Kirkland Court Classic) in Costco for a fraction of the cost.Costco like so many other (too big for your britches) companies stopped making the $12.00-$14.00 shoes, so now I am back to theexpensive Club C's.  Reality is, that at $40.00, these shoes are close to the cheapest CLASSIC tennis shoes you can buy thesedays.I ordered a half size larger (11 instead of 10-1/2), and am glad I did, as the shoes are snug, which should go away after some use.The tread is not as aggressive as the Court Classic, but is not made up of a heal and toe section glued onto a sub sole, but a one piecesole cap that (if I remember correctly) lasts longer than the heal/toe pieces that have a tendency to come apart over time.  What the Club Cwill do, is sooner or later crack somewhere just ahead of the arch.

"The following will be a REAL review of this product, NOT ""I like it"" or ""It works""I am cleaning (Roebic K-570), and adding to my leach field, that was installed in 1986, so the existing two leach lines have lasted 28 years.I contribute this to living in the Mohave desert, as this is unheard of in most other regions of the U.S.The Advanced Drainage Systems (ADS) Distribution box 1369AB is made from the same material as your one gallon milk jug (HDPE # 2), and is also a blow molded product, albeit, a lot thicker. The inspection/cleanout is 6"" O.D. The Septic tank inlet is 5-1/4"" O.D. All other side and back holes (7) are a little larger than 4"" O.D.If you are not using ADS plumbing for this box, you will have to first find a product that will adhere HDPE to PVC, and that you can actually find in your area.I did tests using left over cap pieces from the 3 outlets on one side, and the back outlet (which can be easily removed with a hack saw), and pieces of 3/4"" PVC irrigation line I had laying around.THE RESULTS:Clear Silicone adhesive: NOOatey Blue: NOOatey All Purpose Cement: Fair adhesion, which works fine for slip fits.Liquid Nails: YES. (I used this product as a fillet sealer on the outside (tube to box) to add flex strength,  plus auto rubber undercoating as a final sealer, as I did nut trust the Liquid nails in this environment without some  type of a sealer coating over it).If transitioning from the HDPE box to PVC septic lines (which most of us would do) I would recommend using 5"" long cutoffs of your 4"" tubes to adhere to the box outlets first, and then use straight, and 45 deg. couplers to get to your actual perforated leach lines.You will have to chamfer, and hog out the mating I.D. surface on your 4"" cut offs a bit to fit over the slightly larger than 4"" O.D. outlets on the box.I would also recommend using the Fernco P1002-44 rubber coupler to attach your septic 4"" PVC outlet line, to the distribution box inlet, as the 5-1/4"" O.D. is an oddball size. This also lets you slide the 4"" line into the box first, and then back onto your line coming out of the septic tank which you can then glue in place.You will have to do a lot of prep work if using this box, and the reason I chose it, was because it had three outlets on one side, which is what I needed to add two more lines to my existing leach field.The box is a bit flimsy, but does have a good pan down to collect solids which is where a lot of (so-called) leach field failures happen; at the distribution box, not the leach lines. The box outlets will also flex 10 to 20 degrees, which makes line assy a bit easier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PFQHN27FKPML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UL4A64#wasThisHelpful","R1PFQHN27FKPML","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just rebuilt the rear end section on this scooter for a neighbor who took it out, and told methat the rear axle had broken in the first 30 minuets of use.Being a retired Electro/Mechanical Engineer with a full repair and fabrication shop, many of theneighbors bring me their broken stuff.  For instance, in the last week, I have made this gent polycarbonate (Lexan)spacers for the trucks on one of his skateboards, fixed this cheap scooter, and added 12 inches to the down tube,on his latest scooter where the handle bars were to low.This scooter has some serious engineering problems, that I call the trifecta of bad engineering design.The foot board is made of an aluminum half H section that continues back to fork around the rear wheel and holdthe axle bolt with thin wall spacer tubes, which hold the wheel in place.What went wrong on this specific scooter, was that the forks flexed to much, which made the wheel try to go sideways, whichover stressed the thin wall spacers, and then finally broke the fancy axle bolt at the bottom of the tap for the fancy allen screw.Again, the initial cause of the axle bolt failure was the foot board fork being too long, and in turn allowing flex which set up thewhole domino effect (trifecta).I am sure there are far better scooters available for this price.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SNGCMB3ESPXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTX9TS4#wasThisHelpful","R1SNGCMB3ESPXC","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Had to bring in a smaller bass amp for my bedroom, and switch out from my Ampeg BA112 (50 watt version), soI compared them even though this is kind of like comparing apples and oranges, but it was there, so what the hey.I was actually looking around for a smaller cab 1x12 to replace the larger BA112, but there is no such thing  The orange, and Kustomare a bit smaller than the BA112, but not enough. This is due to a bass amp (more than guitar amp) needing a larger cab for lower frequency resonance created by the speaker, so in most cases, you have to match the speaker size with the cab: Small Speaker=Small Cab,Large Speaker=large Cab.The Rumble 15 (I also have a Rumble 100, 1x15 Combo) sounds much better than I had anticipated, considering my other two bass amps are a 1x12, and a 1x15.  The BA112 is much louder, and can handle the E without breakup which the 15 cannot. With this one exception aside, the 15 has excellent sound (at about half the volume), and you will have to adjust from the larger amps by turning up the guitar, and amp volume morethan you are used to.For the price, and small footprint, this is a great choice for the bedroom (apartment, Etc.) where room, and volume is limited.For those that (unrealistically) expect a big sound out of this 8 inch speaker amp; GET REAL!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30NCH911L4B8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWINK1E#wasThisHelpful","R30NCH911L4B8C","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As stated in the title, you will probably have to make a special table for this belt sander, as it sits much to high onyour typical 32"" leg length high table. (Unless you are 7.5 feet tall). The leg length you will end up with will be from 17"" to 20"" which is around what a chair seat is.  You will also have to Lazy Susan it if the table is against a wall, as you need to rotate the unit to get to the front, the side, and the back when the belt is down so that the belt is moving away from you, instead of coming at you. This is easily done with a round piece of ply with a center bolt going through the ply, and table, and then running four Round Head Carriage Bolts up from four holes in the Lazy Susan ply, which then attach via nuts to the unit. I bought this unit to remove LOTS of material, so the 100 grit belt that comes with the unit came off in short order for my favorite 80 grit belts. I have not (and may never) use the disc sander, so can't comment on that, other than saying I would rather not have it. The unit is LARGE, and a bit heavy, but not as heavy as a table top planner.As stated by other reviewers, the dust collection sucks, and also does not blow, but kind off puffs a little. The black plastic tube needs to be all the way in, as it is just sitting loose in the unit; this is probably the worst part of the sander.You may have to shim the work table mounts to get the table to actually sit correctly.When installing a new belt, you may get a bit of belt slap (ticking), but this will go away when the belt is on the unit for a day.This is a great unit for a hobbyist, and OK for light professional use, but understand, that this is a heavy weight unit, and not something thatcan comfortably be hauled around.When you add in shipping cost from other retailers, this is by far the best price you are going to get on this unit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJSOPSCT3JA26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035K0XCC#wasThisHelpful","RJSOPSCT3JA26","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I do sympathize with all those Fender fanatics out there, trying to pushthe Squier to the Epiphone level.The bridge pickup was DOA, and I only revived it after shooting a good amount of Deoxit D5 into the toggle switch, which is the normal first (go too) place if a pup does not work, as it is VERY unusual for a new pup to not work if hooked up right, as there are NO MOVING PARTS except for magnetic fields.Don't get me wrong, I agree that Squier is an up and coming guitar manufacturer that is makinggreat inroads into the under $300.00 guitar market, and it would have really pissed me off (if I didn't know anything about guitars, like a lot of the Squier market) and had to return this guitar, as the fit, and over all feel, is just great, even though work had to be done beyond the dead bridge pickup thing, like getting the strings down, and then adjusting the saddles to stop a couple of fret buzz areas. The guitar is also VERY HEAVY for a Basswood Squire and comes in at 8.25 Lbs.I purchased three Bullet HH's recently, because they impressed me so much, and this Jaguar is a better guitar than the bullets which seem to have fret buzz problems that require fixing.They no longer make these guitars, which is when I normally swoop in and get the close out deals.The guitar, with it's fixed bridge fits my style of playing which tends to the blues/jazz/rock.I read a review where someone was saying that there was no intonation adjustment on this guitar; so what is that screw on every saddle????","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLEDU6KNEZKFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HZDFSI#wasThisHelpful","RLEDU6KNEZKFB","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"THIS EBOOK HAS THREE MAJOR PROBLEMS:First:  The music and tab notations cannot be enlarged, and are very hard to see.Second:  The included MP3 files are HTTP MP3 addresses, not MP3 files which means you have to be online to hear the music samples; this may or may not be true of the Kindle readers, I don't know.Third:  When you click on the HTTP MP3 file you also get the VERY IRRITATING ""New Oxford American Dictionary"" window; REALLY!When you order a printed music book, you usually get readable music and tab notation, and a music disc.A printed book would have it all over this ebook.Lynne does a great job of explaining the basics of bass guitars chord patterns/progressions with play along HTTP MP3 tracks. Using the Kindle PC App., I can actually hold the bass guitar and follow the book using my remote mouse which makes more sense than fumbling around with a reader that has to be held close to see, and screen touched to move it along.Bass is not my main instruments, which are guitar and keyboards, but bassic basslines is a good starting point.This is my first try at a Kindle file on any device.  The one I am using, is the one that does not cost me anymore money than the ACTUAL e-book (Bassic Basslines) which is by using the Amazon Kindle for PC App. on my computers at home.The Kindle for PC executable file can be copied over to each computer (or loaded from the Amazon site, or other searched sites),  and once you register each computer, your purchased e-book and a few free ones will be available to read.I believe the computer monitor has it over an i-pad, or Kindle reader because of monitor size (obvious) and speed of execution.One of the most important reasons I was staying away from the e-books, was because my eyes are not what they used to be.  This degradation of site is due to age, and (you guessed it) using computers almost my whole life.

"I have over 150 guitars in my collection, and have returned a couple of mid level Fenders that just did not do it for me.FIRST THINGS FIRST. Leave the guitar alone! If you want to replace the tuners, get the same trapezoid tuner, or go to: http://amateurluthiery.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/replacing-the-tuners-on-a-squier%C2%AE-by-fender%C2%AE-bullet-strat%C2%AE/ and make up your mind.What is important on a nut, is NOT what it is made from, but the string to string dimensions, the height (rise and fall), and the proper groove cuts. Bone IS NOT THE BIG ANSWER TO ALL YOUR GUITARS ILLS, and may just add to them, as bone is NOT consistent, and is hard and soft throughout (plastic is consistent). The pickups DO NOT NEED REPLACING, and deliver great punch, sustain, and string response.I bought this low end (I thought) fender just to see what all the hubbub was about.The rationale: If I didn't like it, I could always change out the neck and put a new loaded pickguard on it.For a little over $100.00, this thing just rocks! I just picked up two more on sale at under $100.00 each, so now have 4, plus misc. necks and bodies.The most important thing to me, is that it is made in Indonesia; why you ask, because Indonesia has been producing the best offshore guitars for the last 6 or 7 years, and in my humble opinion blows Korea out of the water on low end guitars.First off, the tuners don't blow as bad as you are led to believe; this may change after a while, but as new tuners, they are just fine.The neck is straight and unfinished which makes it fast. The medium frets are right on the edge of giving you some finger rash, so a little light sanding may be in order.The strings are cheap (Duh!)After installing the (included) extra tremolo spring (I always use 4, this way I don't have to block it), I gave the truss rod a half turn down, lowered the saddles, and corrected the pup angles (closer to high e, further from low E), and voila, other than the stock strings, and frets needing a little dressing, the guitar played just as well, or better than at least half of my mid range $400.00 to $600.00 guitars.The black hardware is great; I get so tired of looking at chrome.....................Pickups sound like they are mid range (6-8K), and come across with good punch and sustain.The shining star on this rig, is the VERY lightweight basswood body. While it may be more dent prone, I don't usually go around banging my guitars into hard objects, and if I did, at $100.00 to $120.00, who cares!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R200Q7SOQI8Z8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004B8IKO0#wasThisHelpful","R200Q7SOQI8Z8H","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had my iPool for 4 years now.I am going on 70 but am still in very good shape, but have just goneon low dose BP medication so have cut way back on the salt and startedcardio routines which (duh!) includes an exercise pool.I was an Olympics hopeful in my teens and trained every day at theSan Diego Town and Country Club (At that time, the only one in Mission Valley) asit was the only Olympic sized pool available to me except for NAS (now Marine air station)on Kearny Mesa.Never made it due to finances; as so many American athletes succumb to, butdid swim for the Marine Corps.Full size lap pools and pump pools are insanely expensive, or take up to muchroom, and I have other things to do with the money I live on.The pool took me about 6 hours to set up at a medium pace and doing other thingsin between. (You know us old folks; we wonder off once and a while)Putting the side rail pieces in was a bit of a challenge, as you need to pay attentionto exactly what side you want the harness on, ladder on, and pump on (which by the wayiPool calls a filter).While we are on the filter subject, iPool recommends replacing the Filter which is thewhole frigging unit once a year and says you should only run it for 4 to 6 hours a day.I have had my iPool for a few months now and agree with the other reviewers aboutthe pump; IT IS A JOKE!Don't even think about using this piece of junk, as it does not move any water.Along with your iPool, go ahead and buy an Intex 637R (56637EG) filter pump from Amazonat around $40.00 which hooks right up to the iPool 1-1/4"" fittings. Use the supplied strainerand water inlet nozzle and just shove them in the holes where the iPool supplied dome strainerswould go.Also, the resistance cord does not last that long (rubber tube). I replaced the set up with fine strand nylon ropes, instead of spending $30.00 plus shipping for something that will go bad after two years.The ladder has been upgraded from the standard iPool which has a problem with the inside bottom rung not being cushioned.Once your in the pool, it is a great workout, and fulfills all of my requirements which saysit should take care of just about any one out there.I agree with a comment from another reviewer that the tie points should be set at the end unlessyou are trying to literally hold up a non swimmer or small child and then you move them up.3 feet or 2-3/4 feet is more than enough to swim in, so don't get excited about water depth.The cover is cheap, but works very well, even with the ladder and harness rig in place, but if youlive in a hot climate like I do (Mohave Valley AZ) you need to leave the cover off, or make sure you have a layer of water on top of the cover so that evaporative cooling of the water can take place. If you leave the cover on without this layer of water on top of it, the small pool will get very hot and feel like a bath. To winterize, I take off the overhead tubes, and use a 10'X 12' heavy duty canvas tarp with grommets that is very well tied down (does not touch water) so that the high winds that come in winter do not rip the cover apart, as would happen with the standard plastic cover. Also, a heavy duty canvas tarp will cost you about the same as the plastic iPool cover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35HYGR3VJSVXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UQV8DA#wasThisHelpful","R35HYGR3VJSVXQ","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Checked gig bags, and they were actually more expensive than this hardcase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UMMH8KWAAMZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002FOBOY#wasThisHelpful","R2UMMH8KWAAMZU","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To start off, before anyone gets their feelings hurt, I am an Ibanez guitar lover, and have over 20 of them.As delivered from Zzounds, the guitar was a complete disaster.The best part of what was delivered, was the guitar case which is a semi-hard case consistingof nylon fabric cover (like a gig bag) with molded and covered, hard foam interior sections.The fret job is the worst I have ever seen on a new guitar; the frets are clipped, with no dress at all.After tuning the guitar and taking that first strum, I wanted to throw up, as it sounded like a badly madeshoebox guitar.Next, I went through the frets which were pitted, and discovered that two of them were loose and high which caused the high e and Bto go dead from the seventh to ninth frets.Because I have over 120 guitars in my collection, I have to work on a lot of my own guitars, and posses the tools andability to do most work including fret, bridge, neck replacement, Etc. Etc., pressing the two frets down and redressing themis no big deal, other than time. I have found the best way to check for high frets (not seated properly) is to use a short metalrod,  1/2"" to 3/4"" Dia., and about 3"" long. You want the rod to sit on 3 to 4 frets at a time. By holding down the rod hard on the frets,and then pressing on one side and another (rocking), and moving it from fret set to fret set, you will be able to discern a slight rocking when a fret  is high.So, bad frets found, pressed and dressed back into place.  Fret edges block filed at the proper angle, filed, sanded, and crowned.Oh, by the way, the fret radius is 9.5 inches.When removing the strings, the nut popped off, and one of the bridge pins broke off, so replaced all the pins, and put a little white glue on the nut and cleaned up the grooves, as they were full of plastic filings from cutting the grooves. I later replaced this deeply cut nut for one that ACTUALLY worked.Replaced the 11-52 strings with new Martin 11-52's, and will probably go with 12's after I am happy with the set up.Tightened the tuning pegs down, as they were flopping around, and treated the fretboard.The guitar sounds great now, but the frets edges will need more work (normal), as I continue to play the guitar.I must admit, that I bought two guitars the same week, and the other was a flawless Epiphone EJ-200CE with NO PROBLEMS!Up front, this did spoil me a bit.To get this guitar right, you would have dumped $200.00-$400.00 at your local guitar shop for a $165.00 guitar.Methinks this makes no sense.......................","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D9M00GXZ0WWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7E3VTU#wasThisHelpful","R2D9M00GXZ0WWC","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Projector: YES.  Monitor: NOT SO MUCH.I bought the Ipevo due to a review I read saying it was a good way to enlarge text tomake reading easier; NOT! I may use it's other functions later, and I may buy a digital projectorfor it, but at this time it is pretty much useless for my current purpose.This is mainly a document reader/camera to be used with a projector, or via your computer and the software included with the package; other reviews go over these functions in depth.If used just for enlarging via monitors, it does not enlarge an 8.5 x 11 inch page enough to make it useful, unless you are using something like a 30"" to 50"" TV screen/monitor, which is the same thing as projecting the image.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DVMOYV1IQ4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ETT3WB2#wasThisHelpful","R1DVMOYV1IQ4L","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE EXACT GUITAR DIMENSIONS ARE: 43"" Long. Upper Bout: 12-9/16"" Wide.  Waist: 10-3/8 Wide.  Lower Bout: 17"" Wide. Upper Bout Thickness: 4-3/16"". Lower Bout Thickness: 4-3/4"". Body Length (including neck heal): 21-1/2""This may be the ONLY place you are able to get this EXACT dimensions, as EVERY Web sight has a different flavor.The guitar, is flat out gorgeous!I am a guitar collector and hobby player with over 100 guitars in my collection.I have stayed away from jumbos in the past, because I am mainly an electric guitar player, and thelargest acoustic I am comfortable with is the Ibanez PN15 Parlor.I wanted a bigger sound as close to the high priced Gibson SJ200/J200 as I could get, and I think this guitardoes just that.  The guitar is made in Indonesia, which I personally like about it, rather than China made.  There is anongoing battle between which is best, but I have had better luck with Indonesia, and that is all I can speak of.The finish is flawless, with no finger rash.  The stock strings are great, with no need to change them out. The action is low, withno fret buzz, and no need for any truss adjustment. I think I lucked out with the set up on this one.I just ordered the Epi hard case from Amazon for this guitar, as their price just blew away everyone else by at least $20.00.I have not tried out the electrics on the guitar, and did not buy the guitar for this function, so look elsewhere for this.Due to my trepidation about the guitar size, I was very pleased that being a jumbo, the guitar felt playable, and reach around wascomplete, without wanting to play in front of a mirror to see where my fingers were placed. I have one guitar (made in Canada...ahemmm) that is 5"" deep, and I just can't play it.This is a VERY well made guitar, with a full rich (not muddy like the Canada guitar) sound, and worth at least twice the asking price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WV4CXUVDWN4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002F6PKM#wasThisHelpful","R1WV4CXUVDWN4B","AKYDGCKCY7H9F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKYDGCKCY7H9F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am not much of a hat person (mainly because they make my hair flat), so I will not be wearing this in public often, but this makes an awesome selfie prop! I don't really like how it looks the traditional way, but to the side or turned around, it is really cute (of course, this is a matter of preference). The colors are bright and stand out against the black background and give it a cute spring look. The stitching is very well done and it's put together sturdily. The bill will bend slightly so you can shape it how you want it (and the logo on the bill is just a removable sticker). Unless you have a really small or really large head, it should fit just fine; there are 7 snaps and you can adjust it so it will fit you. It actually seems a little big on me because it comes down a little past my ears if I push it all the way down, so the fit isn't perfect, but I never wear other hats so I don't know if this is a common problem or if it's just the size/shape of my head or the hat.

"I really wanted to love this necklace, but the chain ruined it for me. First of all, my chain came with no hook closure. There is no way for me to wear the necklace with this chain unless I want to tie it in a knot or something. Secondly, the chain is a lot shorter than I expected. It describes the necklace as a ""long necklace,"" so I expected it to be like a sweater necklace length, coming down to mid-chest. It actually hangs more like a pendant - not that I can wear it with this chain anyway since there is no closure. The chain itself seems decently sturdy and didn't break when I tugged on it, but I'll be disposing of it and buying a new and longer chain.The skull itself is gorgeous, detailed, and intricate. It is not as big as they make it seem in the picture unless that person just has REALLY small hands. I am a 5""3, 19 year old girl, so my hands are pretty small as it is, and the skull is still much smaller than pictured. I will add a picture of the necklace in my hand so you can get an idea of the size. This is not a bad thing, however, at least in my opinion. It's big enough that you can see the detail without being so big that it's distracting. It'll be a great piece to wear on Halloween and Day of the Dead (it looks quite a lot like a sugar skull). The skull definitely makes a gorgeous necklace, but the chain needs a lot of improvement, so be prepared to buy your own chain with this piece.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD5DUMTTQS2UI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QC7PHS#wasThisHelpful","RD5DUMTTQS2UI","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave these as a gift to my little brother and they were a big hit. You get six boxes, three jujubes and three jujyfruits, all in a pretty black gift box. The jujyfruits are my favorite (I actually stole a box back from him they were so good). They're what you would expect from a gummy candy: chewy, fruity, and addicting. The jujubes are also fruity, but they're a lot more chewy than the jujyfruits. I wasn't really very fond of them because of how gummy they were - they stuck to my teeth pretty badly - but they were my brother's favorite. They taste good, just are very chewy. I have never heard of either of these before, but apparently they were one of my mom's favorites when she was younger, so she was very surprised to see I had some and has already ordered some for herself.

"I already have tons of different kinds of cellulite creams, so I gave this to a friend to test it out. She's been using it for just at two weeks now and is actually seeing results. Her problem areas are thighs and upper arms, so she's been focusing on that. The smell is pleasant and not overbearing, and it goes on smooth without leaving a greasy or sticky residue that lots of creams do. She's been using it 2-3 times a day. It is very moisturizing, and while it's not a miracle cream, she has been seeing some results (even I can tell the difference). The areas of her thighs she's been using it on are a lot smoother than before. The difference isn't quite as noticeable in her arms, but there's still some skin tightening. There is still cellulite there and we both doubt that it will go away completely, but she's very happy with how well it's working so far and asked me where I got it so she could buy some more when she runs out of this.

"This works okay, but it's a bit of a hassle to use and it's definitely NOT painless. The coil works by trapping the tiny hairs in between the coils and ripping them out, which is effective but, again, not painless. It's also a bit of a hassle to use. It's a nice tool to have, but I probably won't be using it often. The razor, however, is painless and much easier to use than the coil. It comes with a cover you can keep over the end to protect the blade and protect you from cutting anything with the blade. It's not very sharp, but it is sharp enough to trim facial hair. I have peach fuzz on my upper lip, and the only reason you can see it is because it's shiny and blonde and catches the light. I don't want to actually shave it off because I don't want it to grow back darker, so this razor is perfect for me because it trims it to where it's not noticeable but doesn't actually shave it all the way down. If you have very dark hair that you're trying to get rid of, you might want to use the coil or another method that actually removes the hair completely, because this razor is not sharp enough to do that.

"These bottles are adorable! I got some hermit crabs for my little brother recently, and they need to be sprayed with water once a day to keep the environment moist. I didn't realize until I needed one that I didn't have a spray bottle, so I had been using a cheap one I'd gotten at the store that sprayed a stream of water more than mist. As soon as I got these we switched them right away, and these work so much better. The water comes out in a nice mist spray, not a hard stream. The bottles are pretty small, but we don't use much water out of them every day, so the size is big enough that we don't have to refill them often (plus there are four of them and this is the only use we've had for them so far). The tube goes all the way to the bottom of the bottle, so you shouldn't be left with much, if any, excess in the bottle that can't be sprayed. I got a light pink, a dark pink, a white, and a blue bottle. Since they're the perfect size for small perfume bottles, I've been thinking about using the unused ones to experiment with making my own perfume.

The markings on the front show the milliliters in the syringe - each highlighter part goes to 5ml. I tested them all out and they work great, they haven't dried up or anything. I am a little worried of the plastic part shattering in my backpack, so I've got to be careful with them, but I've already gotten tons of compliments on them when I take one to use in a class.

"These would be super cute jeans if the sizing wasn't completely off. I got size 16 and could tell without even trying them on that they would be way too small. I measured the waist as being 31"" in circumference and checked the size charts several different clothing store websites; these jeans are an 8 or a 10 if you go by normal US size measurements. The leg to waist width ratio also seems to be off; the legs of the pants seem to be very wide, but I'm not able to fit in them, so I can't try them on to make sure. Very disappointed in the sizing; I don't understand why it's so hard to get the sizing correct when there are tons of measurement charts out there that tell you what the measurements need to be.If you actually fit in these jeans, they're super cute and seem to be pretty good quality. The lace on the outside of the legs feels decently sturdy; I would still be careful with them, but I don't think they'll just fall apart. The design of the lace is very pretty and the jeans themselves seem to be made of decent (albeit thin) material.

"This is a beautiful all-you-need set that's great for beginners or more advanced artists. I gave it as a gift to my little cousin. She loves to draw, but has never really experimented with painting before, so she was thrilled to have this set to start painting with. It comes with 24 paint brushes of all different sizes and shapes in a really pretty blue carrying pouch, a white painting palette, and a small sponge. The palette is pretty good quality and sturdy with a hole for your thumb. The paint brushes themselves are gorgeous and you have such a large variety that you have a brush for whatever you might need to paint. The carrying pouch has a flap that protects the ends of the brushes and a strap to help secure it and keep it closed. My cousin is in an advanced art class in school and her teacher has already told them they'll need certain kinds of paints and brushes later in the year, so now she's all set except for the paint.

"I plan on surprising my eight year old brother with this on Christmas, and he's gonna have a blast with it! The Santa hat is really pretty and soft, but it is a little on the small side. If you have a larger head, I would recommend looking for a hat that was larger. It'll fit my brother just fine, though. The only real complaint I have about the hat is that the ball on the end is slightly pink on the side that was pressed against the red part of the hat. It is not very noticeable and doesn't even show up in pictures very well, so it's not that big of a deal, but it does make me worry about the red of the hat staining anything else. The beard that comes with it is pretty good quality as well, although the end looks a little odd. It has a stretchy strap that you put around your head and over your ears and it stays in place just fine. There is a hole for your mouth. I had to trim some of the ""beard"" part so it didn't overlap onto the mouth hole, but after doing that, it was comfortable and not itchy at all.

"When I first took these out and felt the material, I was really disappointed because they feel very similar to another towel I own that isn't absorbent at all and does a horrible job of drying things. I expected the same from these towels, but I tested out the small blue towel after washing my hands, and I'm thoroughly impressed. It works much better than the regular hand towel I have by the sink and is so much thinner and more compact. I got the three pack with a small blue towel (about the size of a hand towel), a larger grey towel, and an xl orange towel. I'm not the biggest fan of the colors, but considering how well they work, I think I can look past that. With all three towels in their pouches stacked on top of each other, they still take up less space than one folded towel I have in my closet. They also have loops attached that can snap undone so you can hang them up; I will probably be cutting them off because I don't need them and they'll annoy me, but it's a feature that could come in handy for other customers. They dry very quickly as well; the hand towel was barely even damp after I got done drying my hands. I will probably keep the medium sized one in my car for emergencies, but the small one is destined to be a dish towel and the large one will go in my closet with my bath towels. I had planned on keeping the whole set in my car, but I love them and want to use them more often than once in a while in an emergency!I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z3RXVW1CTWXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0132E1FJ0#wasThisHelpful","R2Z3RXVW1CTWXL","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the blue one for a couple days now, and these seem to be really good quality! I've had shower sponges before that fell apart and unraveled the first day I used them; thankfully, that doesn't seem to be the case with these. The only downside is that they are a little on the small side. They're probably about the size of my fist or maybe a little bigger (and I'm a 5""3 female, to give you an idea of my fist size - it's not very big). They get the job done, but I do prefer larger sponges to cover more surface area.Still, these aren't bad at all and they'll definitely be used! It comes with a white, a blue, a lighter pink, and a darker pink. They all have small multicolored sponges trapped inside the mesh that add pretty pops of color and help make the sponge more absorbent. This is a good thing because you don't have to use as much body wash (at least in my experience), but has the downside that they don't dry as quickly or easily, which doesn't usually matter, but if I'm packing my sponge to take with me on a trip, I don't like it dripping everywhere.

"I tend to prefer jelly type vibrators, but I'm pretty fond of this one, as well! I'm still not sure if I like the rechargeable feature better than battery powered, but it is definitely convenient when you don't have any spare batteries and to save money. However, the charge does not seem to last as long as with battery powered toys (I think the booklet it came with said an hour, and that's pretty accurate in my experience).It has three buttons, a power button and two back and forth buttons that you can use to cycle through all the different options. They do not let you loop through the options; once you reach the last one, you have the press the other button to go back. This is very handy if you're looking for a specific function, but can also be kind of annoying since it's more button pressing than you would have to do if it would just loop through all the functions instead. The power is pretty decent; it varies by setting, but it can really pack a punch at its highest. The functions are pretty varied so you'll be able to find one you like, and it has standard continuous vibration as well.The charging port is kind of difficult to find at first because it's so small. I actually thought mine was a dud and didn't have one - I had to search for a couple minutes to find it! The loop at the end makes a convenient handle to hold on to.

"This is a really nice shower head with good water pressure! The shower head we had before wasn't detachable, and I'm liking this detachable one a lot better. It doesn't have as many functions as the one we were using before, but the functions it does have are pretty unique. The rainfall is pretty standard, but the waterfall is very neat! It comes with everything you need to set it up, including the mount you can keep it fixed on in the shower. It's improved our water pressure quite a bit and looks a whole lot nicer than the other shower head. The hose is pretty thin and flexible, which is a good thing. A relative I stay with a lot has a detachable shower head but the hose is quite a bit thicker around than this and ends up being bulky and getting in the way during showers. This one is thin and long enough that you can do pretty much whatever you need to with it, great for kids, dogs, or hair coloring!

"Overall, I'm very happy with the results I've gotten from this hair mask. My hair is still hurting from the bad at-home bleaches and many colorings I've put it through, so it needs all the help it can get!Before I go into how well it worked, I do want to mention that the packaging is a huge problem in my opinion. It comes in a small tub; when you take the lid off, the actual product is covered in foil-like wrapping, which is fine except it's nearly impossible to get off without puncturing it in the middle and plunging your fingers into the hair mask. There needs to be a pull tab so you can pull the wrapping off without the hassle.Aside from that issue, I have no problems with this mask. It smells really nice and works pretty well. I have really oily hair naturally, so I was hesitant to use this for the full 5-7 minutes for fear of making my hair too oily. I ended up leaving it on about 4 minutes in the shower before rinsing it out. I used it after shampooing, but before conditioning, and after my hair dried it looked the same as normal - not too oily at all. The difference was not as extreme as I was expecting at first (which is actually a good thing for me, since that means my hair was not overly oily), but over the past few days I have been able to tell a difference in the softness of my hair - I haven't been able to stop playing with it! I initially only planned to use it about once a week to help keep my hair in good shape, but I think I'd be okay using it 2-3 times a week without oiliness being a problem.

"I am in love with this thing. I spend a good amount of my time on the phone since most of my friends live far away, and I also fall asleep on the phone pretty often. I hate the in-ear type earphones that are most popular nowadays, and it's hard to find a good pair of classic earphones that have a microphone, are good quality, and don't break after a week. Even if I do manage to find some good earphones, the cord is extremely irritating when I'm trying to do stuff and I always get tangled in it when I fall asleep on the phone. Earphones are better than having to hold the phone up to my ear all the time, but this headset is infinitely better than earphones.This is the first time I've ever used a headset, and I love it so much. It comes with an extra plastic piece to put over the part you insert in your ear if you need a replacement, as well as a snap-on piece that fits behind your ear to make it more secure. I used it with this piece to begin with, but it made my ear sore after about an hour of use, so I took it off, and it actually stays in my ear even without this piece. I'm not sure how, since my earphones are ALWAYS falling out, but this thing stays in place. It's amazing.The sound quality and mic quality are also pretty great. I can hear just fine out of it, and although according to my friends I'm not quite as loud as I was with my earphones, I'm a lot more clear, so it's still easier for them to hear me. I don't really like listening to music out of it since I prefer being able to hear my music with both ears, but the music I have listened to has seemed to have good sound quality too. I would like a little longer battery life (it lasts about 8-9 hours), but it isn't too bad and will probably be fine for someone who uses their phone a normal amount in a day (I would say I use mine more than normal). It comes with a USB charger, so you can charge it with your computer. It has a LED light on the back that indicates when the battery is low, when it's charging, when it's fully charged, etc - this light is VERY small, and I almost didn't notice it at first, but it is there.

She wears a size medium, but they were as big as a size large in a different brand. You should definitely size down with this product. However, aside from that, they are great. She can still wear them and they still help, they just roll down often when she's walking, which is why she needs a medium. The fabric is light and breathable and doesn't make her hot; it's also thin enough to wear under pants without being bulky or noticeable.

"This has REALLY come in handy for me over the past week. I'm a college student and I have to have everything written down if I want to remember it. I have an on-going to do list that I keep in my notebook, but being able to map everything out on a calendar on the wall has been really helpful, since it's right in front of my face and I can't ignore it. It is pretty big, but I have a whole wall open with nothing on it, so that's where the calendar went. The square for each day is big enough for just about anything you might need to write, and if it isn't, there is a notes section with more room at the bottom (I just put differently colored asterisks to correspond with the day; for instance, if I have something long to put in the 15th that won't fit, I put a green asterisk in the 15th box and then write whatever it is in green in the notes section). It makes it very easy to keep up with everything you need to get done.It is laminated, so it is pretty sturdy and you can use expo markers on it. They wipe off pretty easily depending on the marker and how long the writing has been on there, but even if it's a little tough to get off, all you have to do is use a wet washcloth or some cleaner and it'll come off easily.

It comes with three bands: a blue one, a black one, and a neon orange one.

The blue and black band have only one small stopper holding them in place, and it does not hold very well. I wore the blue band at first, but the stopper/button thing fell out and got lost, so now I'm wearing the black band, which has a more secure fastening piece (I will add a picture - it fastens through two of the holes instead of just one). I have not had any problems since I switched to the black band.The charger is really neat; it plugs into a USB port to charge, but the other part doesn't plug into the band. It's actually a case that you snap around the band; you connect the two metal parts in the plastic case to the two metal parts on the bottom of the band. The case holds it in place while it charges. The screen part cycles through four screens when you push the button located on the side of the screen. The first has the time, battery percentage, date, and several other symbols I haven't figured out yet (mostly because I haven't read the instructions). The second has the number of steps you've taken so far during the day*. The third has the number of calories you've burned that day (I guess it takes into account your steps as well as your basal metabolic rate, but won't take into account any exercise you do that doesn't involve walking, so keep that in mind). The final screen has the UV index, which is really cool to me since I'm very light skinned and this will come in handy for me when deciding if I need sunscreen or not! This might not be a very useful feature for darker skinned people. Throughout the second, third, and fourth screens, the time is also displayed very small in the top left corner.*Note: This is the biggest problem I've had with the band so far. Somehow I went from 0 to a little over 100 steps while I was in bed this morning, so I'm a little suspicious of the accuracy of the fitness band. I know they cannot be completely accurate, but accumulating over 100 steps while laying down seems a little much.The app is also very easy to use. I tested out a fitness band before that had an app with tons of glitches, was hard to read, and measured in cm and g instead of inches and lbs. I've had no such problems with this app yet. There are no glitches that I've found, you're able to input your weight and height in ft/inches and lbs, and there are no painfully obvious grammar/spelling errors. You don't have to have Bluetooth on your phone on constantly for your band to work; it syncs the data whenever you turn the Bluetooth on. I'm not sure how many days' worth of data it stores (it's probably in the instructions that I haven't read), but I turned my Bluetooth off Sunday morning to save battery and just turned it on again at 12:30 AM on Monday and it synced the data from Sunday, so it stores at least a day's worth of data so you have some time to sync it to your phone.The app shows you your steps, calories burned, sleep time (although I'm suspicious about how well this works too), and UV index for each day you use it (you have the option to scroll back and forth between the days). It lets you set daily goals, goal reminders, and even has a silent alarm that wakes you up with vibrations in your fitness band. It has a ton of features and they all work great as far as I can tell. It could use a little improvement in accuracy, but overall it has a lot of cool features and a really useful app, so I would say it's worth the money.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16X4KIU44AAPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013RTKK46#wasThisHelpful","R16X4KIU44AAPD","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love, love, love these knives. I stay in a college dorm and previously I only had one set of utensils - a butter knife, a fork, and a spoon. I primarily ate in the college cafeteria last year so it wasn't that big of a deal that I didn't have many utensils, but this year I have a kitchen and I'm  cooking more, so these knives have really come in handy.They came in a really pretty box that can be used to store them as well. The blades are made of gorgeous white ceramic (this is actually the first time I've ever used a ceramic knife and I really like them), and the handles are curved and fit well in your hand. The blades are pretty sharp - the small one seems to be a little bit sharper than the bigger one - and they each come with a black slotted cover you can put over the blades to protect them. I have not used the bigger one as much because it is not as sharp and I haven't needed a knife that large so far. I tested it out on a chicken breast, but the small one cut better so I just used that. The small one seems to be better for slicing, while the large one would be good for chopping. (I actually lost my one and only butter knife, so the small one has also been handy for spreading butter and peanut butter as well; a butter knife would obviously be better, but it works in a pinch!).These are really pretty, sharp, and good quality knives and I'm very impressed with them.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIK3AYWPR2HK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYUNCLG#wasThisHelpful","RIK3AYWPR2HK0","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The pictures really don't do it justice; this necklace is dainty, detailed, and absolutely gorgeous. It's always a gamble buying inexpensive jewelry because it's so hit or miss (miss more often than hit), but this necklace is DEFINITELY a hit. It looks like a much more expensive piece of jewelry. I received the silver one; it came with nice little bag to keep it in. The chain is normal pendant length, and the part of the chain where you can hook the necklace is about 2 inches long, so you can adjust the length even tighter if you wanted (if I tighten it all the way, it's a choker on me). The chain seems good quality, too; it is very dainty, so I would be careful with it, and it does get tangled very easily since it's so thin (I actually just spent thirty minutes untangling it before writing this review!), but it doesn't feel like it will snap more easily than normal.

"This is a really handy scale, and not just for kitchen measuring. It will measure up to 11 lbs, so it should be useful for just about any measuring you need to do that needs more precision than a normal bathroom scale. I've used it for several science lab activities for class and it's very accurate; I've had no problems with calculations. It also has a liquid feature that you can measure liquids in cups/milliliters, which is really neat in my opinion even though I will probably never have a use for it. It has an auto-off function, but all you need to do to turn it off if you don't want to wait is hold the button down. The buttons are touchpad, not actual buttons. The battery is included and has a piece of plastic in it that you have to pull out before using, so the battery isn't already half dead when you get it. The scale is small enough that it can be stored out of the way easily (I just keep mine in a drawer), but it has a big enough surface that you can measure larger items on it.

"I am not a fan of white pillowcases, not to mention it doesn't go with my bedroom color scheme at all, but I made an exception for this pillowcase because it's so amazing. It's so soft, and both sides are the cool side of the pillow because it stays so cool at night. I've also noticed a huge difference in my skin and hair since switching to this instead of the cotton pillowcase I was using before. My hair is a lot less tangled when I wake up, which is a really great benefit in my opinion because I'm not losing as much hair in the shower while getting out tangles; I have thin hair as it is and less hair loss is always a good thing. I've also noticed less breakouts so far. I washed my pillowcase as often as possible, and I'm sure it wasn't the only factor to my breakouts, but it's definitely not as bad now that I've switched to this pillowcase, at least so far.

"I absolutely love these! I got them for my college dorm room. I was a little worried they wouldn't stay up because the walls here are not completely smooth - they're a little bumpy - but it's been a week now and they're staying up just fine. I cut the wires to make them fit the wall that I wanted to put them on, and they look great. The wires did start peeling after just a few minutes, but that can be easily solved by overlapping the birds with the wire slightly, and then the birds hold the wire to the wall. The birds are holding up just fine, and they were very easy to peel off. There were a couple of places that didn't want to peel, but if you tried on a different area (for instance, the beak wouldn't peel so I just started from the tail instead), they come off fine - no problem at all. I'm not sure how long they'll last or how well they'll hold up after resticking them because I got them all right in one try, but I'm hoping to be able to use them again next year. They're super cute and really brighten up a room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXRZLRR8MBJ1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCY4KV6#wasThisHelpful","RXRZLRR8MBJ1G","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm really torn on this shampoo. On one hand, it makes my hair feel amazing, very smooth and silky. But on the other hand, I'm pretty sure I actually started losing MORE hair in the shower after switching to this shampoo. This could be because I was just paying more attention to it since this product is supposed to decrease hair loss, but at the very least, it did not stop the hair loss at all, and definitely did not make it better. This shampoo is NOT sulfate free, which was also a big disappointment to me; for a shampoo that claims to be so good for your hair, you'd think they'd at least not use sulfates, which are horrible for your hair and actually accelerate hair loss. Also, my hair seemed a lot more frizzy when I used this shampoo - that could have been because of the heat, since it was pretty hot that week, but I'm not sure. I stopped using it after a week because I was afraid of losing more hair; my hair is thin enough as it is after years of bad at-home dye and bleach jobs. I will probably try it again soon to give it another chance; I will update if I notice improvements.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EXO4F2D5CMZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KU8FYN0#wasThisHelpful","R3EXO4F2D5CMZ7","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: I did NOT buy this product on Amazon. I received a sample directly from the seller to review.I am definitely lacking in makeup skills, so I probably won't use all these brushes, but I know enough to be able to tell that they're good quality! I had a set of brushes before these that I never used, mainly because I hardly ever needed them, but also because they were horrible brushes - every time I used them I would end up with loose bristles shedding all over my face. Now that I have these, I was very happy to throw the old ones in the trash! These have not shed at all since I've had them, and I've used them a few times to test them out. They did have an odor when I took them out of the package, but after washing them with shampoo and letting them dry, the odor is gone. I like that the tips of the bristles are white so you can see the pigment on them; my old brushes were completely black, so I could never tell if I had enough product on them or not. With white bristles, it's much easier to tell, and also much easier to tell if you've gotten them completely clean after washing them. The color combination is really pretty, they feel really nicely made, and they fit well in your hand. Like I said, I am not a makeup connoisseur, but these are definitely all the makeup brushes I'll ever need - there are 5 bigger, chunkier brushes, and 5 smaller, skinnier ones. They fit perfectly in the pouch that comes with them, so storing them and keeping them clean is easy.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSLQ8Y5U0SKBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012SBVNY0#wasThisHelpful","RSLQ8Y5U0SKBI","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: I did NOT buy this product on Amazon. I received a sample to review directly from the seller.This is a pretty good quality wig, especially for the price it's selling for. The red is very bright and the hair does not look completely real - you can definitely tell it's a wig, in other words - but it would be fine for cosplaying or as a Halloween costume. I just wouldn't recommend wearing it out on a date or to an interview or anything like that. The ends are more wavy than curly, but the style of the hair is very pretty (and if I'm not mistaken, you can style it yourself, too, although I have not tried). The bangs are a little long for my tastes, so I trimmed them and I like them much better now. It comes with a wig cap, which is very handy especially if you have long hair, and a comb. The wig doesn't tangle as easily as I thought it would, so that's a definite plus! I put it on for about an hour and when I took it off there were hardly any tangles (I know an hour doesn't seem like too long, but I've had wigs before that got tangled if you so much as looked at them). You can clean it by using shampoo just like normal hair.

"These are super cute containers that are great for portion control, but I do think the quality could be better. As soon as I removed them from the packaging, a few of the colored tabs fell off some of the containers (not the actual tabs themselves, just the rubber-feeling colored part) and I was not able to get them put back on where they would stay. Additionally, and a much bigger problem - many of the lids would not snap down all the way, making the ""leakproof"" claim disputable. On one of the smallest containers, the lid would not stay on at all; I think it's because of the size of the container, since I had the least amount of problems with the bigger ones.Aside from the design flaw of the lids, these really are great for portion control diets. Portion control of every type of foods is one of my biggest challenges and also, in my opinion, the key to healthy eating. I have a bad habit of just counting calories when I diet, not actually eating healthier, so I'll eat carb-filled calories and no healthy calories. The portion control containers allow you to have a reasonably filling meal (it's a lot more food than you would think at first!) with the right portions of every food group. These also come with a few recipes; I did not really like them, but they're a good place to start if you're new to this! They're also dishwasher safe, so they're easy to clean after using them. I do not use them for every meal because I'm a college student with limited funds and kitchen space, so it isn't really an issue for me, but if you plan on using these for every meal, I recommend buying more than one set unless you're a fan of washing dishes.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S707BZUR6UPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011X7G9IA#wasThisHelpful","R1S707BZUR6UPF","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are so many cute designs I had a hard time picking which ones I wanted - I want all of them! I ended up going with the groundhog ones though because I like the color combinations, and they're just as cute in person, although the groundhog doesn't really look like a groundhog to me (more like a bear, maybe). Either way, they're super cute and well made. I'm on my feet a lot every day and if my socks aren't thick enough, my feet start to get blisters or feel like they're burning because of the friction. These are perfect - thick enough that friction pain isn't a problem, but still breathable so I can wear them outside during summer in the south. I also like the length of these socks.

"I wear a size 10 so I was a little worried I wouldn't be able to wear these, but they fit me pretty well. I think the sizes need to be explained a little more clearly - these socks are apparently 9-11s, which I took to mean they fit women with shoe sizes 9, 10, or 11, when in reality, they fit shoe sizes 5-9 (confusing, right?). The ankle part is a little unforgiving and doesn't have as much stretch to it as the rest of the sock, but I think that is a good thing - for people with smaller feet, it won't be a problem at all (although it makes me, Bigfoot, have a little more trouble getting them on), and it makes them stay up really well since it's so tight they won't slip down (not tight enough to cause discomfort, though). I don't know why, but I always have the problem of socks slipping down my heel when I walk a lot, but so far I'm happy to say I have not had that problem with these socks. They are pretty thin, light, and breathable, so they're perfect for wearing during the summer.

"I really like the design on these shirts! I got the tank top, and my only issue is that it is definitely not suited for people with boobs. It says it is unisex, but the tank top, at least, is designed more for a male. It would have been so cute, but the chest area puckers in a weird way on the side of your chest between the breasts and the armpit because it is not designed to accommodate a fuller chest. This would not be a problem for someone with a flat chest, and this would not be a problem if you got the tshirt instead of the tank top. The armpit area is also cut much lower than I would have liked, to the point that my bra is exposed.Aside from the design problems, I really like the tank top. The navy blue is very pretty, the design is unique, and the material is thick (not the flimsy kind of tshirt material that rips in 2 days) and will hold up well.

"These are absolutely gorgeous temporary tattoos that hold up very well - think of them as the slightly grown up version of the temporary tattoos you plastered yourself with as a child. These are gorgeous, have a metallic sheen, and hold up very well if you're careful with them (although if you put them on your hands, they tend to not last nearly as long). It comes with 5 sheets filled with gorgeous tattoos, which could be used in an endless amount of ways if you have imagination (I don't, but that's not the point). I used them with my niece and let her choose which ones and where to put them for both of us. They go on the same way as your typical temporary tattoo - cut one out, remove plastic, put it face down where you want it, apply a wet cloth, and you've got a beautiful tattoo that holds up for a good few days before starting to look bad. I really like the concept of these tattoos; you have small designs like feathers and arrows, but you also have strands that can be worn to look like a bracelet or a necklace or other jewelry. They definitely look a lot classier than regular temporary tattoos (to me at least), and they hold up much better as well. I'm very impressed, and while I will probably not be ordering more for myself (what can I say, even though they're gorgeous I feel silly as a young adult wearing temp tattoos), I will definitely be getting some more for my niece, who absolutely loved them.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RSR7421UGJRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01118NN30#wasThisHelpful","R3RSR7421UGJRI","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The biggest flaw about this phone mount is that you can't listen to any CDs while using it, but since that's part of the design, I don't feel like it merits having a star taken off. A friend of mine has a horrible sense of direction and uses a GPS pretty much wherever she goes that isn't in the immediate area, but in one of the big cities closest to us there's been construction done and a lot of new roads added, so she gets turned around pretty much every time she ends up in that part of town, which is often. Upgrading the maps on her GPS would cost a ridiculous amount (I think over $100, maybe $200), so I suggested that she just use her phone as a GPS instead, which is a much cheaper option. I gave her an air vent mount that I had but she didn't like it because it didn't hold her phone very well. She didn't want a suction cup mount either because she just got a new car and was afraid it would leave marks, so I got this one for her to try out. It is unfortunate that she can't use her CD player while using this mount because she likes listening to audio books while driving, but other than that flaw, it's great. It fits securely in the CD player, and her phone (I forget what kind she has but it's some sort of offbrand Galaxy S4 lookalike) fits in it just fine, even with her case (although the case is not very bulky). Everything is secure and doesn't fall out, which was the case with the air vent mount. It does swivel, which comes in handy when you need to adjust your view or let someone in the passenger seat look at the screen.

"I absolutely love this bag - the design, the color, the size, everything about it. It looks like a smaller bag was just increased in size; a lot of times, larger bags have odd proportions and just look bulky, but that is not the case with this bag. I was actually surprised when I received it by how spacious it was. When you receive the bag it just has the hand strap attached, but there is a longer attachable shoulder strap included in one of the many pockets it has (and seriously, it has a bunch). The color is a very pretty brown; maybe it's just the younger generation opinion coming out in me, but it looks almost retro, like something I would have found in the back of my mom's closet and enjoyed carrying around at school and showing off when I was younger. It's made of very sturdy, thick, and good quality material; I'm sure it would show some wear over time, but it would definitely take a while and a lot of rough handling before you started noticing any signs. It feels very durable, which is a wonderful quality to have in a travel bag. It's large enough that you can fit pretty much your whole house in there; I'm pretty sure I could pack for a week in this bag with no problems (and I don't pack lightly). It definitely holds more than my backpack does without being larger. It's less bulky than my backpack is, and in fact, I used it instead of my backpack on my latest weekend trip. It has tons of smaller pockets - you have to search for a good 10 minutes before you find them all - as well as a very spacious main pocket. The zippers are good quality, as are the straps, which is definitely impressive, because let's face it - the bag can be made of the strongest material in the world, but if the zippers and straps are no good, then the bag is basically useless.

"I gave these to my cousin as a gift - she recently got an oil diffuser and only had a couple bottles of essential oils, so this was a nice set to go with her diffuser. I do think they could have been packaged better - when I got them they were out of the piece of cardboard that's supposed to hold them in place - but thankfully they were still intact and not leaking or broken. It comes with six scents, and I think the differently colored labels are a nice touch. The scents are basic ones that you find in almost every set, but they do smell nice. It does come with an ebook that gives you ideas for other uses than just oil diffusers; I passed that along to my cousin as well who was very excited about it since she's a very artsy person and loved some of the ideas that were in the eBook (I think she's wanting to try making scented candles with them first). This is a very nice set with a wide range of scents, and the eBook with inspiration is a very nice addition to this set. Highly recommended.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OI2WIB1YKRRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V0NZFBK#wasThisHelpful","R2OI2WIB1YKRRL","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this cream for about a week and a half now and have already noticed results, which is a very good sign! I'm really excited to see how well it improves my cellulite in the next month or two. It's August in Arkansas, which means it's definitely shorts weather, and while I am confident enough about my body to wear shorts without much anxiety, it definitely would be nice to get rid of or at least reduce the cellulite on my inner thighs, which is my main problem area. This cream goes on smooth without being too stick or oily or plain unpleasant like cellulite products I've tried in the past, and it has a nice scent - not too overwhelming, but it doesn't smell medicinal, either, which is great. I've only been using it for a week and a half, so no miracles have occurred, but I have definitely noticed some improvement - the skin is firmer, smoother, and less bumpy than before, especially the very upper part of my thighs. It comes in a good sized bottle, so it will last me for a while longer, but if it keeps working as well as it has been, I will definitely be buying more when I run out of this.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R283UPPX4YV4GD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U7O6KAS#wasThisHelpful","R283UPPX4YV4GD","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I tried two sets of batteries and made sure I was putting them in correctly; it just doesn't work. The component that holds the batteries is not well made and actually slides out of it completely, connected by a wire in the bottom.

"NOTE: I did NOT order on Amazon. I received a free sample from the seller to review.I really, really wanted to like this dress... but there are too many major issues to ignore. First and foremost, the sizing is horrible. I wear an XL in most things but sized up to XXL and it was still way too small. The waist part where the bodice meets the skirt is not stretchy AT ALL, so even if the waist part fits you, if your bust or hips are bigger than your waist, there's no way you're getting it on since there is no give. See the measurements I took below (might be slightly off, but if they are, it won't be by much); even compared to the size chart, this runs way small. If you compare the actual measurements to the size chart, this is between a medium and a large; if you wear a 10/12, the XXL will probably fit (at least in the waist!).As far as the material goes, the quality was about as I expected. Don't expect a designer-made dress, but the quality was acceptable. It was about equal to or even a little better than some pieces I've gotten at Forever 21, quality-wise. However, there was a very noticeable black stain on the cream colored part of the skirt (see pictures when they are posted). The design of the dress is very pretty, although I would say the skirt is not exactly as shown in the pictures. However, the sizing and the stain are huge issues to me, and if I had actually paid for the dress, I would have been returning it. Most (or all?) of the other reviews that I've read have not mentioned a problem with stains, however, so as long as you will fit into the dress, I would recommend it.Measurements for XXL:Bodice (from shoulder to waist): 15.5 inchesWaist: 30 inchesFull sheer skirt: 25 inchesShorter coverup skirt underneath: 12.5 inchesI received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NGP304CRO7A5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBLFGHO#wasThisHelpful","R1NGP304CRO7A5","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is such a neat steamer - I didn't even realize that these existed, but I wish I had found them sooner! I got the yellow and green one and I love it. It is pretty small but it can hold a surprising amount, and it can be folded up flat so you can store it easily or take it with you easily if you wanted. I've only used it for mixed vegetables so far, but it works like a charm. I wash it by hand to make sure I get the inside clean, but it's very easy to wash and then it's ready to use again.

"I have gotten several pairs of seamless cotton socks from this brand for my boyfriend and he loved them, so we decided to try these out since less foot odor is never a bad thing and he didn't have any black socks anyway. He is a size 12 and these fit him great, and he says they are very comfortable. Neither of us knew what to expect from bamboo fiber socks, but they are very soft and unlike other reviewers, we've had no problem with durability. They've been washed at least three times by now and are still in great condition. The cuff is thick and tight so the socks stay up even when he wears them all day, and although it doesn't get rid of odor completely, it's definitely reduced compared to normal cotton socks. They are dress socks, so they would be great if you needed to dress up, but they're also good for casual wear; he works in Home Depot and has worn these to work a couple of times now without a hitch. He spends all day on his feet, so comfortable socks (and shoes) are super important. These definitely fit the bill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJUFPGF6LWUDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U90C2ZC#wasThisHelpful","RJUFPGF6LWUDL","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these as a gift for my boyfriend because he loses socks quicker than he can buy them. They'll fit sizes 8-12.5 in men's, which is a pretty wide range; his foot is on the larger end of the spectrum (he wears a size 12) and these fit him just fine. One thing I really like about them is the fact that they're seamless. I don't think it matters much to him, but the seam on the toes drives me crazy when wearing socks, so I'm considering getting some of this kind for myself! The top part of the sock is pretty snug, so it doesn't roll down even when he wears them all day. They're cotton socks and they're a good thickness - not so thick that they're hot or make your shoes tight, but not so thin that they don't protect from rubbing. I honestly didn't like the color combination at first, but after seeing them in person I like them a lot more; they're dark enough that they don't draw attention if seen under your pants leg, but they still have an interesting design and aren't boring, solid-colored socks. He's very happy with them and we will most likely be ordering more when he starts running low again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LGGYD6RFPRB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UU77ILM#wasThisHelpful","R1LGGYD6RFPRB5","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave this case to my little cousin who recently got an iPhone 6 for her birthday. She tends to like pretty design cases more, but she thought this one was really neat since it could charge her phone. She has a couple of other cases meant mainly for decoration rather than protection, but they're very hard to get off her phone, so she doesn't have one on most of the time. This one is slim and lightweight, so she carries it around in her backpack at school so she can charge her phone easily and discreetly. It's a very slim case, but I would love to see it with prettier designs; the colors are plain and I don't like the text on the back of the case. Still, it's very useful and serves its purpose, which is primarily to charge your phone, not to look pretty. It's nicely made and doesn't feel cheap like some cases do, and the cutouts are precise and clean (a pet peeve of mine is when cases look cheaply made, but that's not a problem with this case). You charge the case separately and then put it on your phone when it's running low on battery, and the charge lasts a surprisingly long time; her phone rarely dies while she's out or at school now that she has this case as backup.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RFHBEZ4WFR7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YEFWK0A#wasThisHelpful","R3RFHBEZ4WFR7F","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pillow is great, but if you prefer soft pillows, this is NOT the pillow for you. I love super soft pillows and I'm used to using feather pillows, so this pillow was way too firm for me and made my neck ache the first night I used it. However, I gave it to my uncle, who prefers firm pillows, and he loves it. It really is a good quality pillow, it's just not for anyone who prefers pillows that are softer. The memory foam is thick and plush, and it actually also makes a great cushion to sit on. It comes with a really soft removable cover, but I also put it in a pillowcase; the first pillowcase we tried didn't fit it because it was so thick, and it was a tight fit in the second one, but it did fit.

"I've never really needed to use a callus remover before because I lotion my feet every day, but I have been more active outside and busier this summer and have neglected my lotion routine, so this has actually come in handy a lot. I like the fact that it plugs in rather than uses batteries; I have so many battery powered electronics that I spend a fortune on batteries every month, so I'm glad to not have to add to that expense. It works really well even on the toughest areas and fits well in your hand; it even has ridges on the side so you can get a good grip while using it. I've never used one before so I didn't know what to expect, but it isn't painful to use at all, and although it is a little gross, it works wonders to buff away the dead skin until you get to the smooth skin underneath. I always apply lotion right after using it and it leaves the skin super smooth and much softer than before. It also comes with an extra roller and a cleaning brush, which I didn't realize would be so useful until I actually used the callus remover. It says the color is red, but it is actually pink, as shown in the pictures.

"NOTE: I received this product for free to review from the seller. I did NOT order on Amazon.I'm used to standard leashes you hold in your hand, so this took a little getting used to. I would recommend caution when using this - if you are a small person, even though the elasticity in the leash does help you not to be pulled around as much, I still would not advise using this with a big dog that could overpower you. Just use common sense and you should be fine! My grandma used this with her poodle and was fine, but she could not use it with our big German shepherd. I am stouter than she is, so I tested it out with the German shepherd, and she did jerk me around a little bit (she is very hyper!) but I was able to keep control of her. If your dog is leash trained already, you should have no problem. The belt part will fit waists up to 46"", so one size fits most. The leash is a little short for my liking, which is why I'm taking off a star, but that's because I'm used to giving the dogs lots of leeway while walking. If you need to keep your dog right beside you when walking, this leash is perfect. It stretches out quite a bit, but it does put strain on you when it's stretched out all the way; however, this might not be a problem for someone stronger/taller than me. It's sturdy enough that the very hyper and huge German shepherd puppy did not break it.

"After finding myself in several situations where I had to ask someone to open a bottle for me in the past year, I decided I needed my own bottle opener, but never got around to getting one. I'm glad I waited until I got a chance to snag one of these, because they're awesome. The box came with a label warning saying it contained chemicals known to cause cancer/birth defects in the state of California, so that's a little concerning (I'm guessing it's safe to use or it wouldn't be sold?), but other than that concern, I love this bottle opener. It's a pretty big bullet, which is good because it's easier to get a good grip on it. It fits really well in your hand and it makes getting bottle caps off a breeze. There's a small lip that attaches under the edge of the cap, which makes it easy to get the it off in one fluid motion.

"This is definitely the best method of preventing mosquito bites that you can find. I hate bug sprays because they're sticky and I feel like I need to shower after using them, and mosquito netting doesn't work if you're out and about, so I've really grown to love mosquito repellent bracelets. I've tried patches, as well, but I definitely prefer the bracelets because they're easier to keep up with and can be worn multiple days in a row. These bracelets are particularly nice because the design and colors are actually cute and they're a practical one-size-fits-all. I've tried some in the past that were adjustable via a button, and it didn't stay on as well and it was more of a hassle to get on than these, which can just be slipped on. I often sit outside at night so I usually have at least 5-10 mosquito bites on me at any given time. I wore one of these bracelets last night when I went outside and didn't get a single bite! Each bracelet lasts up to 11 days after you open the pouch, and there are 10 bracelets in the pack, so you're protected for the whole summer (unless you share). There's a variety of colors, so you can even mix and match with your outfit if you wanted. My pack came with 3 green, 3 blue, 2 red, 1 orange, and 1 purple.

"This is going to come in handy so much for me - I wish I had ten of them because the possibilities are endless! It is pretty roomy; out of all the items that I carry around with me when travelling, the only things that won't fit are my lotion and my conditioner, and that's only because the bottles are huge. Everything else can be stored in this easily, which saves so much space, and since the pockets are clear and it has a hook so you can hang it somewhere in the bathroom (or wherever you'll need it), it saves a lot of time digging around in a bag to find what you need. It does fold up, but it is a little bulky when you have it filled with stuff, and there is no latch or anything to keep it folded up - I'm thinking about adding a velcro strap on it myself so I don't have to worry about it coming unfolded during travel. There are ten compartments total: 2 large ones on the bottom, one long one on the next row up, three medium sized ones on the second row from the top, and four smaller ones on the top row. There's a lot of variety in size of the compartments, so you can find a place for pretty much anything from pill bottles to shampoo bottles. The compartments also zip up so your things are secure and don't spill out of the bag. I will probably keep this one hung on my bathroom door for easy access to what I need while still saving space, but I'd also like one to put in my closet for various odds and ends, and it would also be great for a first aid kit or to store office supplies in next to my desk - which is why I need about ten more!

"My little brother has been wanting an ant farm for some time, so he was very excited about this one. He's only had the clear gel ant farms in the past, so this one will be a new experience for him. I do wish that the sand colors were different; especially for an ant farm called Rainbow Ants, it seems like there should have been more color variety and black and white should not have been included. It could be much prettier with a wider variety of colors included and the black and white taken out. The red, green, and blue are pretty, although I would have preferred a brighter red. The tank itself was much thinner than I expected, but that's not a bad thing; it will make it easier to see the ants, especially since visibility will be harder than in a gel tank. It is curved slightly and is a nice looking tank with a secure lid. It also comes with a mystery stick (I have no idea what it's for - maybe for moving the sand around, but it is not long enough to fit too far down into the tank) and a small magnifying lens you can use to see the ants up close. It says there is a coupon for free ants, but as with most things, free isn't really free - you have to pay $3.50 (shipping and handling) for approximately 25 harvester ants. We can't order ants right now because it is too hot where we live (you're supposed to order when temperatures are between 40 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit, I believe), so we might end up catching some ants on our own to use. Since I obviously haven't gotten any ants yet, I can't speak about my experience actually keeping the ants in the ant farm, but the materials are nice and it's a good kit (aside from the odd color choices for the sand).I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YVWZUPPINX11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001SHBYMC#wasThisHelpful","R1YVWZUPPINX11","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in a college dorm most of the year and I use a blackout curtain to block out the light in the morning. While that setup is great for sleeping in, my last plant didn't really appreciate the lack of sunlight and didn't make it through the year. I'm super excited to be able to use it in my dorm this year so I'll be able to have a plant without giving up my backwards sleeping schedule. It fits in place of a normal light bulb, so you can put it in just about anything. I have an extra desk lamp that was never used last year that I have it in right now. I don't move into my dorm until next week so I haven't tested it out on my plant yet (I got a pack of African Violet seeds that I'm going to plant when I move in), but I have had it on one of the house plants in my grandmother's house and it's definitely flourishing more than it was before, so I'm excited to see how well it will do in my room. I definitely do not have a green thumb as it is, so I'm glad to have this light because my seeds will need all the help they can get if they're being tended to by me. It doesn't produce any heat which means it won't damage your plants or your lamp (my desk lamp will melt with normal bulbs if the wattage is too high or they're left on too long; this is the second one I've bought since I melted the first one). It's also long lasting - I can't attest to that since I've only had it a few weeks, but I'm hoping the claim is correct and I won't have to worry about buying another one for a few years!

"My hair is my biggest vanity, but I probably don't take care of it as well as I should. I'm a sophomore in college and I've been coloring my hair since 7th grade, so it's definitely not in the best shape it could be. I used to have pretty thick hair, but after using Splat hair dye and bleach for a year (this was two years ago) to color my hair blue, purple, and pink, my hair started thinning and was in horrible shape. I'm still nursing it back to health, so I was very happy to try this shampoo out considering it's loaded with good-for-you oils and vitamins and is sulfate free. Sulfates are the components of shampoos that makes them lather up when you're using them, but they're horrible for your hair. I used this shampoo for a week and I'm beyond thrilled with how it improved my hair (I stopped using it after 7 days to test out a different brand, but I will definitely be coming back to finish this bottle and probably ordering another one). It does not lather up as much when you use it because it's sulfate free, which does take a little getting used to, and you have to be careful to not use more than you need to make up for the fact that it doesn't lather as well - using way too much shampoo is easy to do and will cause you to run out quickly, especially if you're not used to sulfate free shampoos that don't lather as much. It smells nice, but the smell is very subtle and I don't usually notice it. Right before I started using this shampoo I colored my hair again (professionally - no more at-home kits!). My hair always feels thicker after a fresh dye, but it feels more coarse as well, and it usually takes 2 weeks to get it back to as soft as normal. However, after a week of using this shampoo, it was back to as soft as it was before I had it colored, which is a big achievement! Sulfate free shampoos are also great for colored hair since they help preserve the color longer. A little over a week after a dye job and my hair is soft, shiny, and looks very healthy.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R354Y8F8I6L9SW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQNCHE0#wasThisHelpful","R354Y8F8I6L9SW","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The charcoal pencils also come in different levels of hardness, so there is a lot of variety, and assuming you know how to use them, you should have everything you need to create the perfect sketch or drawing. It has a sharpener and an eraser specifically for the charcoal pencils as well as a sharpener and eraser specifically for the graphite pencils. It really does have everything you need! My friend has used it a few times since I gave it to him and loves it. He didn't have a nice set like this and used plain #2 pencils to draw with, so he was very thrilled to get this set.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW6FPQRWVJS4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWCQSV6#wasThisHelpful","RW6FPQRWVJS4A","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun activity for kids of any age - my little brother loved it and I had fun, too. The package comes with two gloves (pink and green), a bottle of bubbles, a small tray to pour the bubble solution in, and a bubble blowing tool. The gloves looked REALLY small when I first took them out of the box and I was worried we wouldn't be able to use them because they'd be too small - even my little brother's hands are bigger than the gloves, and he's only 8. However, they stretch tremendously. I was able to fit one on my hand - admittedly, I do have small hands, but it still stretched an awful lot (I'll post a photo for size comparison). You might not be able to fit your hands in these gloves if you have huge hands, but most children and women should be able to fit them, as well as some men if you have smaller hands. The bubbles last a surprising length of time when you're handling them with a glove on. We shared the gloves and each put one on, but it would definitely be easier to catch and handle them with two gloves; he kept forgetting he couldn't touch it with his hand and ended up popping a lot of them until I gave him both gloves and let him continue on his own. The bubble blower is neat, I like it better than the traditional wands that are in most bubble bottles since it seems to be a little easier to use and the bubbles turn out bigger. This is a fun activity that would be even more fun if it came with two pairs of gloves!I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MASBD6PY2TCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Z57APU#wasThisHelpful","R3MASBD6PY2TCR","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These bags are awesome and a lot bigger than I expected - which is a good thing! I usually put my delicates in a pillowcase to wash them, which works just fine, but this is definitely a much nicer solution. The only complaint I have about them is the colors - orange and purple seem a little Halloween themed, especially the orange zipper on the largest black bag - but that's not a big deal at all and definitely doesn't merit a lower rating. I like the size variation because I can use a smaller bag if only washing a few things or the largest bag if I'm washing more - I could probably fit every delicate I own in the largest bag, honestly. It comes with five bags, two small size with orange and purple zippers, two medium size with orange and purple zippers, and one large size with an orange zipper. You do need to tuck the zippers in before washing so the bags don't come open, but as long as you tuck them in you shouldn't have a problem. The mesh is good quality and the zippers are sturdy. Also, not only are these good for washing, but they'd be great for packing, too. I am moving back to college in the next week and will definitely be utilizing these for packing some clothes since they're large enough and you can fit a lot in them. They're good quality and definitely a better option than washing clothes in a pillowcase!I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZEML154ZTXYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9KQPWU#wasThisHelpful","R1ZEML154ZTXYE","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got my S4 almost a year ago now and have been using the same case ever since I got it because I'm so picky about phone cases. I need one that looks good, works well, and doesn't make my phone too bulky. This case fits the bill - mostly. Turquoise is my favorite color, so I love the colors on this case, and the design is nice looking; I like that the whole case isn't turquoise but it still has that nice pop of color. However, it is definitely GREY and turquoise, NOT black and turquoise, which is what was listed when I purchased. The case was a little hard to get on over the buttons since the turquoise plastic part is so hard and unyielding, and once I finally got it on over the rubber part, it didn't fit just right because the rubber was shoved out of place. The case is a little thicker than my last one, but it still fits in my pocket just fine, so that isn't a big issue for me. The buttons are still easy enough to press while in the case, but the cutouts are a little messy for the headphone opening and other openings at the top. It's a double layer case, which I definitely prefer since I find them to be a lot more effective than cases that only have either the soft silicone or the hard shell, but the plastic feels kind of lightweight and not as good quality as my old case, and the silicone part is not secured enough at the top and bottom and pops off easily. It also comes with a screen protector, which is wonderful since I actually didn't have one on my phone before - I had ordered one but it didn't fit my phone correctly (that's what I get for ordering off eBay I guess), so I just haven't been using one. This screen protector fits a lot better, so now my phone screen is protected as well. This is a good cheap options for a phone case and the design looks nice, but it is a step down from my $20 case that I'm used to having on my phone.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRN472IQJLTXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BXCWEM#wasThisHelpful","RRN472IQJLTXS","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always heard about how great aloe was but I'd never actually tried it. I've definitely been missing out! I'm amazed by the number of uses it has and by how well it works. I'm very light-skinned, but I bought a pool this summer and have been spending a lot of time outside, so I get sunburned fairly often when I forget to put sunscreen on. I put some aloe on it and it was almost instant relief. I recommend keeping it in the fridge for an extra cool feeling when applying it. I've also used it on mosquito bites with just as much success - it really helps take the itch out! Those are the only two things I've tried it out on so far, but there are so many other things I've read that it helps with that I want to try - cuts and scrapes, blisters, and even on hair (I am a little nervous to try it on my hair, though).

"This body butter is amazingly hydrating and feels amazing on your skin. I usually use cocoa butter and I like it a lot, but I think this might work even better. My only complaint is that it's a little oily - not enough to bother me on my skin (it just feels soft, moist, and not greasy at all), but enough that I can't use it on my face since I battle oiliness there anyway. I put it on right after getting out of the shower and drying off, and after one use I could already feel the difference, especially on my legs - they get really dry when I don't use lotion for a while for some reason. It also smells and feels great when you put it on, definitely better smelling than the cocoa butter I usually use! It smells good without being overbearing.

"This is definitely one of the neatest items I own. It does take a little longer to use than a normal clip or twist tie, but it doesn't take too long to heat up and seal and it does keep things fresh longer than clips since it is more airtight. It's not just for food, either - I have several bags that are supposed to be able to be vacuum sealed to keep bugs and moisture away from clothes/blankets, but they don't actually work. They were expensive so I stowed them away in a closet, but now I'm able to pack them with old blankets that I want to store and use the mini sealer to seal them and keep them safe. It works on things with a thickness up to 3 mm, which doesn't seem like much when you first read it, but if you actually look on a ruler, 3 mm is pretty thick! I haven't found anything that I needed to seal that I haven't been able to seal yet. It does take a little getting used to when you first use it, and it's a little different on every different type of material you use it on (chip bag vs. sandwich bag, etc), but once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to use.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AFZOVCYK34YV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WESOWNM#wasThisHelpful","R3AFZOVCYK34YV","AJUNQAGGQS28N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJUNQAGGQS28N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave these to my grandmother because she's been looking for bowls that were microwaveable and dishwasher safe for a while now, and for some reason has had a hard time finding them, so she was thrilled to get these (plus they're also airtight and freezer safe). They have a vent in the lids for when you put them in the microwave, which is really neat - I've never seen bowls designed like that before. Usually, if you use containers like these in the microwave at all, you need to take the lid off before microwaving, so it's very handy that you don't have to with these - just pop them in the microwave and you're good to go. My only complaint about these containers is that they're kind of small. The sizes listed are accurate, but I would have liked larger containers since we've found that a lot of the time these are too small to fit all the leftovers in, even the biggest size.

"This is not really a history of what we understand as physics today, but rather a history of intellectual attempts to understand nature around us on some basis other than the supernatural. A large part of the book covers centuries of metaphysical thought. It contrasts competing lines of reasoning, and explains their shortcomings in describing how the universe actually works, which is what we expect of science today. How much you like this book, and your inclination to continue reading this book, will depend a lot on how interested you are in this topic.It is only around the time of Galileo that modern science begins to emerge, with a focus on experimentation and the description of the universe in mathematical terms. This begins the story of physics that is normally taught today, although this author takes an unusual path. In this book we find the practice of physics, rather than the enduring results, highlighted. We see the public lectures and demonstrations, the influence of practical inventions on the advancement of physics, and the underlying metaphysics that evolves but never really goes away.The story continues through the development of relativity theory and quantum mechanics, and into the post WWII era of big science. But then it sort of peters out. Only snippets of current physics are covered, although the author finds room to discuss plate tectonics which, while a great discovery, is not currently considered ""physics"".If the early parts had been condensed a bit and the finish stronger I would have gone for four stars. But as written this book leaves me somewhat unsatisfied.I was provided a copy for review by the publisher.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AB25MQKNMTQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DJRHQG#wasThisHelpful","R1AB25MQKNMTQP","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short book has two parts, the first being about the prediction of and then failure to find the Planet Vulcan. The second is about Einstein's development of the General theory of Relativity, and how it explained why there was no need to hypothesize a new planet. Despite the piece of the subtitle claiming ""How Albert Einstein Destroyed a Planet"", Vulcan was gone before before Einstein arose.After the fortuitous discovery of the planet Uranus, careful tracking of its orbit suggested there was an unaccounted for gravitational influence on it. Astronomers has gotten very good at using Newton's law of gravity to calculate the influences the planets had on each other, and thereby predict their orbits. But Uranus' wasn't quite right. The brilliant, ambitious, and cunning French astronomer Urbain-Jean-Joseph Le Verrier predicted the orbit of another planet, and at his request the Berlin Observatory observed it. (Alexis Bouvard has earlier predicted the existence of another planet, and John Couch Adams also predicted an orbit for it. But it was Le Verrier who convinced someone to actually look for it based on his prediction.)Successfully predicting the location of the planet Neptune made Le Verrier's career. Then another opportunity arose. His calculations of the orbit of Mercury didn't match observations. He postulated another planet within Mercury's orbit, ""Vulcan"", and predicted where it might be seen.Unlike the case of Neptune, where there was initially little interest in actually looking for it, many people wanted to be the first to see Vulcan. And several did, or so they thought. But it could never be found again after any of those observations. Eventually it became clear that there wasn't another planet within Mercury's orbit. The error in calculating Mercury's orbit remained a mystery.The book then jumps to Einstein, and his sudden and amazing rise to the forefront of physics. In particular, his development of the Special Theory of Relativity, and its modification of Newton's gravity. But the Special Theory didn't account for accelerating objects. Einstein spent about ten years working on and off on the General Theory. It made two significant predictions that could be measured fairly easily. One explained the orbit of Mercury. The other was that the sun would bend the light from stars twice as much as Newton's theory predicted. The 1919 eclipse allowed the second prediction to be tested, and General Relativity was established. And Mercury's orbit was understood.This is actually a short book broken into two shorter books. The stories of Vulcan and Einstein share nothing other than the motivation to explain Mercury's orbit. The first part will appeal to those how enjoy historical tales of mistaken chases. The second will appeal to those who want a brief history of Einstein's development of the General Theory. How many will enjoy both is harder to predict.Interestingly, the author didn't delve into the later controversy about another predicted planet. With one found (Neptune), and one never there (Vulcan), there was later a concern that Neptune's orbit wasn't quite right. That turned out to be an error, but it did lead to the prediction of yet another planet. When Clyde Tombaugh searched in the predicted area he found, by a sheer fluke, Pluto; Pluto actually had nothing to do with Neptune's orbit. Had astronomers known how small Pluto was, and that its orbit was eccentric, inclined, and locked into a resonance with Neptune, they might never have called it a planet. But, believing it was a large body perturbing Neptune's orbit, it was considered a planet for decades. And its demotion to a minor planet thus became a big deal.I was provided a copy for review by the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E0TTPI9KHJW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812998987#wasThisHelpful","R1E0TTPI9KHJW2","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read American Indian Stories and Old Indian Legends (Dover Thrift Editions), I was interested to learn more about Zitkala-Sa. The only biography I could find was this one, aimed at middle school children.Much of Zitkala-Sa's early life is taken from her own writings, which I had already read in the book noted above. The later parts are somewhat sketchy, perhaps because there is not a lot of material to work from. Some insight is gleaned from her letters, and from those we learn that she could be headstrong and manipulative. But that isn't really too surprising after reading her own published writings.While I would have liked a more extensive biography, this is a well written book and wholly suitable to its target age group.

"Although long interested in Native American history and culture, until I ran across this book I had never heard of Zitkala-Sa (Red Bird). That was clearly my loss. She turns out to have been an extraordinary woman, and one worth becoming acquainted with.This collection of works has three sections. The first are her reminiscences of her time on the Yankton Reservation, and then her time in a boarding school where they tried to take the Indian out of her. In her case the results yielded a very complex figure. Being unusually intelligent, western learning and music appealed to her. But she also retained a profound resentment for the way whites had treated the Native peoples. This part is very well written, and is both compelling and informative.The next section has some of her writings in defense of Indians and demanding that the country honor the treaties it had signed with the native nations. These works are far more formal in style, and of more historical than literary interest.The final section contains translations of stories she heard from elders when she was a child. Most are about Iktomi, their culture's trickster, and contain moral lessons relating to his failures to attain what he wants by subterfuge. The stories vary in quality, but that is to be expected from such collected stories; the translations all seem well done.This is a short, inexpensive book that provides a great introduction to an extraordinary woman.

"Ian Tattersall has been at the forefront of the understanding of human origins for decades, as well as being a prominent writer in the field, and this is his opportunity to look back, from the twilight of his career, at the development of the field.While this book covers the history of the field it is, by the author's intent and admission, a personal view, not a not an attempt to be comprehensive or balanced. Tattersall spends a lot of his narrative on misinterpretations, closed mindedness, dead ends, quirks of personality, feuds, and the like. This helps to elucidate the rocky path paleoanthropology has followed to get us to our current, and still disputed, understanding of our ancestry. He provides a good discussion of what molecular and DNA testing have told us, and also why it has sometimes met opposition from cladists when molecules have seemed to tell a different story than bones, or at least how one person or another has evaluated bones.This is a short and easy to read book that contains a lot of information, history, and authorial insight.

You can get Rachmaniov's own, amazing, recording, in admittedly very dated sound. Then there is the wonderful recording by Earl Wild. Most every great pianist has recorded it, often very well. This one's no slouch, but not the best, either.The primary interest is the selection of her own pieces, three improvisations and a work for piano and orchestra.
