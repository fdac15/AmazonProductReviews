"I got this for my nephew after he hurt his tailbone while riding his bike on a course near our home. These bicycle shorts are great; he tells me that they are very comfortable and that they keep him very cool while also giving him great protection. They seem to fit true to size too; he wears medium sized clothes so I got the medium and he tells me they fit perfectly. Overall, I'm very pleased with this find and highly recommend this product.I received this product free to review.

"This is a cool product that my hubby really likes. Since he switched to a job in the city, he has been using his phone more on his commute. He plays games, reads books and watches HD movies. He uses this very slim and compact case to carry an extra micro SD card with more video files. It also lets you carry extra Sim cards and includes a very handy USB micro SD card reader. Overall, he really likes this product. The quality is good, the price is affordable and I would highly recommend it.I received this product free to review.

"Ever since I was a kid, I have really enjoyed reading in the shower or bath. I used to cover my books in plastic so that I could do this, but now that all of my books are on my phone, I pop my cell in a waterproof cell phone case and use that to read in the shower. My mom recently mentioned that she wanted a waterproof case too so that she could take her phone to the pool when she goes for her swimming classes. I decided on this product as it is exactly what I was looking for. It‚Äôs super easy to use; you just drop your phone inside the case and fasten the clasps at the top to seal the case shut. This case is super slim and doesn‚Äôt affect the touch screen function at all. The blue color is very pretty and it has a nice strap that you can use to securely hold your phone.

"With four kids, you never know when you are going to need to mend something and I love compact sewing kits like this one since I can carry with me everywhere. I have one in my handbag at all times and plan to keep another one in the car. I have larger sewing kits, but they are rather bulky and heavy and are a pain to get out of my crafts closet. This kit is great because it has everything you need and is super light and compact. I added a few more safety pins as I know that one will never be enough, but it has plenty of everything else. There are eight spools of thread in a variety of useful colors as well as a thimble, scissors, measuring tape, needles, etc. all in a nice case. Overall, I am very pleased with this product and think that it‚Äôs an excellent value. I highly recommend it!I received this product free to review.

"I was very excited when I was found this particular product because we found that the carpet in a corner of our basement is mildewing. I am using baking soda, vinegar and some other solutions to try to clean this area, but it still smells weird, so I hung this on the wall just above this corner. I was very happy to learn about this product. We have a pretty big dehumidifier and an air purifier down there, but I wanted to find something small to put in our storage closets and in the boiler room. I also wanted to find something that was natural and non-toxic. This natural bamboo charcoal bag seemed like the ideal solution as it had everything I was looking for. It's very easy to use; I just hung it on an existing hook on the wall. After about a week, I went downstairs to check and it was noticeably dryer and less smelly. I am planning to purchase a few more so that I can put them in our closets and shoe cabinet.

"One of the few things that I don't love about having a fur baby is the fact that he often pees in odd places, which can cause us to be rather unpleasantly surprised at inconvenient times. Upon receiving this product, we were delighted. This is a well made UV LED flashlight that helps you find stains and UV-sensitive markings. This flashlight is very compact and has a nice weight to it, without being too big or heavy; it feels really good in your hand. I also like that it takes AAA batteries (not C or D batteries, which I rarely have in the house), which are included as a nice touch. It works very well, but you should note that it really works in the dark. Overall, I‚Äôm very pleased with this product and know that we will continue using it!I received this product free to review.

"This aLLreLi HD 4K(3840x2160) Mini Displayport to HDMI Cable is 1.8 m long and 4K compatible. We were really happy to see that this cable is extremely well made. The connectors are gold-plated and the cables look quite durable. We tested this cable to connect my laptop to both our television and our projector. The picture quality improved significantly after we switched to this cable. We are changing to Macbooks at work, so I will update after I test it with my new Macbook as well.

"I love lighting candles in my home office or in our bedroom at night; I love the way they smell and they help me relax and get a good night‚Äôs sleep. I really like this set of party votives as it has a lot of really delicious-smelling green tea scented candles. I absolutely love matcha/green tea and the fragrance of it, so this was pefect for me. The candles smell great and help me relax when I am in the bath or before I go to bed. They burn very evenly and for a pretty long time. I also love that they are made right here in the U.S. because this always makes me feel more confident about a product.

"I went on a trip to Asia a few years ago and was pleasantly surprised to learn that they use bidets everywhere in Korea. Seriously, every public and private bathroom we stepped into had a bidet. While it was a little daunting for me because I had never used one before, I soon found that they are fantastic. They make your rear end feel so clean and you can use them in conjunction with or in lieu of toilet paper. I really wanted to get one for our bathroom at home, but everything I  saw very expensive and/or they would require us to hire a plumber to help install them, so I was very pleased to find this one. It is very affordable and super easy to install. It is so easy to use too; even the labels on the control are upside down so that you can easily read them while you are on the toilet.

"This micro USB charging cable is so cool. I am constantly losing or breaking my cables because I carry them to and from work in a ginormous handbag with tons of other things. This cable is super well made and sturdy. It lights up to look like the power is flowing into your cell phone and the speed of the lights slows down when it is almost done charging. The lights even turn off when it is finished charging. I think it charges relatively quickly; I am just really happy with the quality of the cable and how nice it looks while it is charging.

"Sliced tomato really nice... but making fries out of a potato almost crushed the cheap plastic as I tried to get it through the slicer.

It has four thickness levels to choice from... more blades and it works. The blades are also super SHARP. It has rubber feet that hold it in place better. You can elevate it at one end. Most important, the plastic housing doesn't feel like it will break, when pressure is applied while slicing fries. As for the one made in Germany, I had hoped it would be better, but it's not.

"I've had five of these Magnavox HDD / DVD recorders and normally I love them.  I have two 533s in use, and a newer model in reserve.  Another 533 died after a storm -- probably an electrical surge killed it -- but was otherwise great.  This older model H2080, though, has given me lots of trouble.This recorder kept resetting to factory settings at least every 48 hours.  I noticed that at 11:58 each morning the machine would automatically start whirring -- perhaps it confirms its clock setting at 12 noon? -- and often this would lead to everything resetting.  I never had anything scheduled to record at 12 o'clock, so I can only guess that this was some sort of maintenance function in action.  At any rate, I got tired of rerunning the antenna setup and re-entering my timer list every other day.

"I'm frankly puzzled by the enthusiastic reviews for this movie.  The film is clearly aimed at very small children and will likely frustrate adults and intelligent children with its clich√© humor and poor plotting.  The motivations of the characters (albeit LEGO toys) are missing and there is a moralistic message of co√∂peration that is undermined by the success of Clutch Powers as an individual and by the lack of character development in the other LEGO figures who are having difficulty getting along until they aren't.  This message is much more effectively delivered in ""The LEGO Movie"".  That film, along with the LEGO Batman movie, is eminently preferable to this boring and puerile effort.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5X2XP7IYAEK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030ZIZRC#wasThisHelpful","R5X2XP7IYAEK7","A2NE7D8GC41UCL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NE7D8GC41UCL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's nice to have this ""Raffles"" double film set.  I like the books and both films stick to the initial Raffles story pretty well, except for offering Hollywood endings.  The 1939 David Niven film is a fairly-close remake of the 1929 Ronald Colman ""Raffles"", but the 1939 is much better paced and, apart from its crime-does-not-pay required ending, is a superior film.  I say this, despite the fact that I prefer Ronald Colman to David Niven.  If you like 1930s and '40s crime film series like ""The Thin Man"", ""Boston Blackie"", ""The Lone Wolf"", and company, you'll probably enjoy these two Raffles movies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QQ09QALQSZZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU1YG6G#wasThisHelpful","R2QQ09QALQSZZJ","A2NE7D8GC41UCL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NE7D8GC41UCL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Zorro Rides Again"" is okay, but certainly undeserving of the over-the-top reviews I've read at Amazon.  The story is so-so, with Zorro coming out of retirement after someone starts impersonating him maliciously.  The acting, apart from the leads, is pretty bad -- like mediocre community theater -- and the Castilian lisps are overdone.  Preteens may enjoy the play, but I think most older children, and all but a few adults, will find it far less engaging.

"About half of these cartoons are good, the rest are rather mediocre.  These Disney cartoon collections are over-priced and niggardly-supplied -- just eight cartoons of varying quality.

"As another reviewer mentioned, the picture is worth a thousand deceptive words, because what you're getting here is a big piece of burlap with two sets of black concentric circles printed on it.  Pretty simple.  Burlap is hardly self-healing, as the advertisement claims.  Sure, the arrow goes in and you can pull it out and the burlap thread has largely been thrust-aside, but it pretty-much stays that way, so you'll quickly end-up with lots of little holes.  Still, it's not terrible and lasts long-enough, I suppose.  Yet for this price a piece of burlap seems kind of a rip-off....  If you're willing to spend $25 for a true self-healing target, I recommend the Arrowmat Arrow Mat 1 Spot Target 17""x17"".  Mounted atop a few layers of neoprene and you've got a nifty long-last self-healing target for about $50 -- much less than a standard brand-name self-healing archery target.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REL22E80MK9Y0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001IVFRNU#wasThisHelpful","REL22E80MK9Y0","A2NE7D8GC41UCL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NE7D8GC41UCL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Don Ricardo Returns"" is a B-picture, and a rather-poor swashbuckler at that.  Isabelita is fairly-bad and the fellow who plays the friar kind of stinks and Fred Coby is just okay.  In other words, the acting isn't going to win any awards.  Neither is the editing.  The direction is pretty poor too.  So what does ""Don Ricardo"" have going for it?  It has some fine fencing, a serviceable story, and humor.  Just the same, if you haven't the means or willingness to do some home-editing, I don't recommend ""Don Ricardo Returns"" unless you're a completest swashbuckler-collector.  As for me, I've put ""Don Ricardo"" through the Corel Video Studio Pro treatment, removing stupid bits, paring-down overlong scenes, and trimming the entire film by almost ten-minutes.  This effort has taken a D+ movie and made it a C+, and I've had lots of fun in the process!","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ILRTZGPOCIVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AVCYJ0E#wasThisHelpful","R1ILRTZGPOCIVX","A2NE7D8GC41UCL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NE7D8GC41UCL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This arrow-rest is okay, as far as it goes, but I've found a better, much longer-lasting, and less-expensive alternative.  The Bear weather arrow-rest is initially accurate, but quickly wears away and that can lead to inaccurate shooting.  Tired of these disintegrating arrow-rests, I drilled a small hole through the side of the riser (on my recurve bow) opposite to where one places an adhesive arrow-rest like the Bear.  I then screwed-in an inch-long wood screw, bent-up the protruding part slightly and screwed-on a standard plastic drywall anchor.  I've found that arrows fly more accurately now, and the drywall-anchor arrow-rest lasts longer and can be inexpensively replaced.  The wood screw lasts as long as the bow, of course.  In brief, this Bear weather arrow-rest is as good as the other brand-name arrow-rests, but a 5-cent wood screw and plastic anchor provide a far-better solution.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2681BUXU7F31O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AVDKQ#wasThisHelpful","R2681BUXU7F31O","A2NE7D8GC41UCL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NE7D8GC41UCL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Volume 3 has the best artwork in the series to date, and the most consistent, and these were my favorite chapters of the story so far (other than the fine Jimmy Olsen prologue in Volume 1), so things are moving in the right direction as I'm concerned.  Some have criticized this volume for not having enough action, but I think the story-telling is quite exciting.  I really enjoyed Superman / Kal-El adjusting to life on New Krypton, training the Kandorians in their yellow sun powers, keeping an eye on General Zod, and gently trying to show everyone a better way.  Perhaps my favorite story is ""World of New Krypton"" Part Two, where Commander El (Superman) is ordered by General Zod to stop a herd of rampaging though-beasts ""by whatever means necessary.""  His solution is so essentially Clark / Superman: clever, compassionate, efficient, and as non-violent as possible.

"I'm enjoying this New Krypton story arc.  Volume two has somewhat better artwork than volume one.  The six chapters in volume two lead up to the creation of New Krypton in synchronous orbit with Earth, and Superman departing for his new home.  There are lots of confrontations and fisticuffs, General Lane and Luthor continue to scheme and attack Kryptonians, Aunt Alura needs a hug, and Superman just wants everyone to get along.  The many story threads are still dangling at the end of the volume, so I was left feeling a bit at sea, but I'm having a pretty good time reading and looking forward to the rest of the tale, so I consider this $10 well spent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2840F6X50C1BP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401223192#wasThisHelpful","R2840F6X50C1BP","A2NE7D8GC41UCL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NE7D8GC41UCL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read about this blu ray player in ""Sound and Vision"" magazine several months ago and was excited by the possibility of owning a 4K blu ray player with Technicolor certification -- for just $100!  After checking at Amazon from time to time over the succeeding months, I finally found the player available in January 2015 -- though selling for $130.  I checked around and purchased it from Sears.com for $90.The set-up was very easy.  I simply unplugged the coaxial digital audio cable and the HDMI cable from the back of my old Samsung blu-ray and plugged them into the Seiki player.  The full list of inputs is: HDMI, LAN, USB, Coaxial Digital Audio, a stereo pair of RCA audio inputs, and CVBS (yellow RCA video -- why would anyone buy a blu-ray player and use this feeble connection?  I wish it had S-Video instead).I've tried four different blu-ray discs, a DVD-RW, two DVD-Rs, and a DVD and they all played without a hitch and look fabulous.  (The manual lists BD, DVD, DVD-R/+R, DVD-RW/+RW, VCD, CD-R, and CD-RW as all compatible, by the way.)  I haven't fiddled much with the settings on the Seiki yet -- the user can adjust resolution, t.v. system (NTSC / PAL / Multi), color space, sharpness, video mode, and video noise reduction, among various other things.The remote control is so-so.  There are a lot of buttons and they are pretty small (and I have small hands).  It took me a few seconds to find the play/pause button!  Still, it's a serviceable remote and I hope to incorporate its functions into my universal remote.The player itself is attractively sleek and modern looking, with its gently curved surface and its three large buttons (open/close, play/pause, and power).  This elegant design does make stacking other components on the Seiki a bit tricky.  I have a small DVD player and a small all-region DVD player on top of the Seiki and they're stable enough, but it wouldn't handle anything bigger on its roof.  I also trimmed and kept the manufacturer's cellophane over the three big buttons, since as these face upward they are likely to be dust catchers.The bottom line is, I'm very happy with my $90 purchase and couldn't be more pleased with the ease of setup and the quality of the picture from this Seiki blu-ray player.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FTME3VTJEVBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MB54M9W#wasThisHelpful","R3FTME3VTJEVBD","A2NE7D8GC41UCL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NE7D8GC41UCL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd never seen this version of ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" before purchasing these discs, though I'm a swashbuckler collector and a fan of Richard Chamberlain from ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers"" films.This is an excellent, if somewhat altered, rendition of the Dumas story.  The first hour is rather leisurely paced, though entertaining, but the second half really hums.  The story has action, intrigue, betrayal, romance, and lots of gorgeous costumes and locations.

"I'm enjoying this New Krypton story arc more than I thought I might, though the Jimmy Olsen prologue is even better.  This first volume of ""New Krypton"" begins after the ""Superman: Brainiac"" book, following Superman's defeat and capture of that Coluan scoundrel.  The best story and artwork in Volume 1 is the first, ""From a Cub to a Wolf"", from ""Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen Special 1"".  Jimmy is investigating a shadowy figure, and his investigation leads him to Cadmus and to the strange desert town of Warpath.  The Jimmy Olsen story concludes in the next chapter, ""The Worst Night of His Life"", but the artwork is far inferior.  In fact, apart from the first story / chapter, the artwork in this volume ranges from mediocre to juvenile.  Really, I'm surprised that DC allowed such poor penciling -- the sort you'd expect from a high-schooler who might, one day, be pretty good.  People look past one another, poses are awkward, and figures frequently look unnatural.  However, the storytelling remains good throughout, but the first two chapters of Jimmy Olsen are the real treat, and worth getting this volume for.  The New Krypton storyline starts with the third of five chapters, and begins with the tale of what happens after the bottle city of Kandor is restored to full-size (next door to Superman's Fortress of Solitude) and the Kandorians are free to roam Earth with the same powers as Superman.  Hijinks and tomfoolery are the results.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUKCT894M5MBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140122329X#wasThisHelpful","RUKCT894M5MBY","A2NE7D8GC41UCL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NE7D8GC41UCL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Superman for All Seasons"" is a marvelous book.  In four season chapters it offers a fresh and very moving version of the Superman origin story (Smallville and Metropolis parts, no Krypton).

"We purchased this to help burglar-proof our home.  It wasn't too expensive, and not too hard to apply, and it does frustrate prying eyes, so we're happy!February 2015 Update:My husband and I applied some of this film to both sides of the glass on two cabinets.  It took several hours for seven panes, but wasn't difficult and we couldn't be more pleased with the results.  The effect is that of an antique mirror, and only with low indirect light can one see the inside at all, and then only indistinctly.By the way, the key to separating the adhesive backing from the film is a piece of Scotch or packing tape at a corner -- one piece on each side, with half the length of the tape on the film and the other half held between your thumb and forefinger on each hand. A firm (but not violent) pull will separate the layers.

"~BACKGROUND~I purchased this throwing brace for my 10 year-old son who has had a history of inconsistent throwing motions which effects his accuracy and his velocity due to his fear of making a poor throw.  My son is 4'5"" tall and scrawny.  ThrowMax recommends an Extra Small (up to 4'7""), but I went a Small (4'8"" - 5'2"").I have been coaching little league for the past 6 years.~PROS~- Appears to be well made with quality materials- When properly placed on the arm it works as described:  > keeping the elbow up  > preventing the elbow from from going too far ahead of the rest of the arm  > preventing side arm motion  > preventing arm only throws- Includes a paper with various drills to help improve throwing motion~CONS~- The instructions leave a lot to be desired:  > The instructions nor the brace itself does not indicate which end of the brace is the top and which is the bottom.  I had to search the web to find pictures of people wearing them.  > There are 3 flexible bars in 3 widths on the brace that run from top to bottom. The instructions are not very clear on where the bars should be on the arm.- As others have stated, the straps irritate the skin causing discomfort..  The design/material could be improved.- Most kids' arms are thin and taper down in size from their shoulder to their wrists.  The brace therefore slips down unless it is strapped in fairly tightly - which causes discomfort as stated above.~TIPS~The listing on Amazon does not show the sizing recommendations, so I've typed them here for reference from ThrowMax.Extra Small - up to 4'8"" heightSmall - 4'8"" - 5'2"" heightMedium - 5'3"" - 5'8"" heightLarge - 5'9"" height~CONCLUSION~The Small fits my son just fine.  Since the instructions were lacking and to understand how it worked I tried it on myself to figure out strap tightness and proper placement.  I'm 6'2"" and 175 pounds and the brace fit me and worked just fine.  There was only the discomfort from the strap.  I did not have any issues with the brace sliding down since I have some muscle definition which prevented the sliding.Overall a nice product and I recommend it to correct throwing motions.  Just be mindful of the potential for skin irritation and discomfort that others have stated in their reviews.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IUIJVLSOGXEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F4BKCI#wasThisHelpful","R2IUIJVLSOGXEN","A62S8THB8S60B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A62S8THB8S60B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**Update 09/2014**Since my review I have smoked many pork shoulders/butts, chicken breasts, turkey breasts, whole chicken and fish with NO ISSUES.  I will reiterate the need for proper maintenance and technique to use not just this unit, but ANY smoker.  Disregard the bad reviews - if you learn to properly smoke then this unit is a great bang for the buck.~Background~This is the first smoker I have ever owned or used.  To this point I have smoked numerous pork butts, pork shoulders, briskets, chicken and fish.I have uploaded a picture of 16 pounds of Boston Butt.  After an overnight brine of apple cinder vinegar base and 6 hour rub, I used apple chips and smoked for 18 hours at 225 degrees.  The end result was a nice dark and crispy bark, great smoke ring - (which some raters stated is not possible with an electric smoker), and juicy, tender meat that fell off the bones.~Pros~- Food quality is on par/better than other methods such as charcoal and propane.- Easy assembly.- Easy to use - plug and start.- Easy to maintain temperature since it's electric.  Trust me, I know charcoal using smokers who are constantly checking temperature, adjusting air flow/temperature.- No need to purchase or worry about charcoal or propane. My brother-in-law owns a charcoal smoker and he spends far more time maintaining the meat, charcoal and chips and prepping and cleaning up.- Two racks that can easily hold 10-14 pounds each.- Lid has a ""hook"" that allows you to hang it from the smoker itself.- Great bang for the buck.~Cons~- The screws inside!  These are a hazard as you can scratch your hands and arms, snag clothing, etc.  This can be a pain if you are pulling the top rack to mop the lower rack and reaching inside to mop.- No side door.  This would be extremely beneficial in being able to add more chips and empty the drip tray.  I'm pretty handy and plan on modifying my smoker and installing a side door.- No thermometer - only low/medium/high temperature settings- Too airtight, but easily solved by not sealing the lid as tight as possible.  Others have suggested drilling holes in the lid and/or sides.- Not the most durable handles, but as long as you don't beat on it it should last.~Tips~- Buy Old Smokey Replacement Grease Absorbents to replace as needed.  It can be found here on Amazon.- Leave the lid slightly ajar to allow some air to escape.  This will prevent the condensation buildup inside the smoker.- To clean: Use a pressure washer.  If you don't have access to one, put some water and vinegar/lemon into the drip pan and crank the smoker up.  Let the condensation build up.  Turn off, and wearing thick gloves, use a grill or wire brush to scrub the inside.- Purchase a thermometer to monitor and maintain appropriate temps: 2"" Thermometer- Purchase a heavy duty outdoor extension cord Fellowes 99597 25-Feet 1-Outlet 3-Prong Indoor/Out Heavy Duty Extension Cord~Conclusion~Traditionalists will say ""charcoal tastes better"", but a blind taste test would strongly beg to differ as I have made pork that bbq loving people have said is ""the best"" they've ever had.I'm sorry, but those that are giving this smoker 1 star clearly have no clue or idea of how to properly smoke meat.  The end result is how YOU use the smoker - it is not a magical cylinder that transforms meat into juicy, tender goodness.  Proper technique in prepping and maintaining the meat, choice of chips, maintaining the proper temperature for the appropriate duration all add up to a great final product.If you have any questions or need guidance I'd be more than happy to answer them - just leave me a comment!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DJIJ9AX0CV3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F54551U#wasThisHelpful","R1DJIJ9AX0CV3Q","A62S8THB8S60B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A62S8THB8S60B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sure, there‚Äôs a lot going on in this book. Covert ops, a wanna be paranormal detective. Supernatural shenanigans. But that‚Äôs only part of it.I‚Äôm huge on character driven stories and Get Real has some fun ones.I fell for Francesca immediately. She‚Äôs snarky, sexy, and so ready to become a paranormal detective and kick some supernatural butt.Enter bad boy Rafael. Ooh, he‚Äôs swoon worthy to look at, has the under the lashes come hither look down pat, and a mouth begging to be kissed.When Francesca and Rafa catch each others eye at a party, the heat goes up in the room. When they end up together in the bathroom, their kiss is steamy.If you‚Äôre thinking, oh no, another love at first story, you‚Äôd be right, for a few minutes. Then Rafa drops an ice cube on the passion and walks away, leaving Francesca gasping for air. You can bet she‚Äôs not happy. She knew better than to go with a bad guy like Rafa. See if he ever kisses her again.There are some other fun characters, but these two really had me going. The snarky dialogue, their inner thoughts, all of it cracked me up.What happens next, you ask? You guessed it. Francesca and Rafa wind up having to work together as the world around them starts going wiggy. And that‚Äôs just as fun. The two of them are as busy trying to ignore their attraction for each other, as they are for trying to stay alive.Nothing but fun here. Looking for a little mystery and danger, some witty dialogue, and steamy romance? You should read this book. I promise you‚Äôll laugh.I received this book for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UTWLEWS2A8RM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010GLMPSM#wasThisHelpful","R2UTWLEWS2A8RM","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I couldn‚Äôt help but feel something familiar when I started this story. Reminded me of certain other books I‚Äôd read. That‚Äôs not uncommon when there are so many stories out there.  So if this happens to you, don‚Äôt stop reading. It‚Äôs the author‚Äôs job to spin their own tale, to move from familiar to fresh, to new. And that happens soon in this book.With so many characters, it‚Äôs hard to discuss all of them. I do have some favorites though. There‚Äôs Ember, or course.  Her powers are out of control. She‚Äôs a danger to herself and all those around her.Then there‚Äôs Mace. He‚Äôs a grim, a reaper of sorts. He has to consume souls to survive. He‚Äôs what you‚Äôd call a good bad guy. Sexy, snarky, and as spicy as his name implies. Like the chemical spray, he‚Äôll burn ya.Ember‚Äôs first encounter with Mace ends with a shovel to the back of his head. Their next encounter is electric. They‚Äôre like magnets. Each one‚Äôs power is drawn to the others, whether they like each other or not. The humorous dialogue and situations lighten the mood.A couple more I want to mention are Kai and Rhys. One human. One werewolf. Both are a mess of anxiety and unrequited love. Puppy love.After Ember‚Äôs father dies, she‚Äôs lost and alone. But not for long. She‚Äôs soon whisked away to a new life. One filled with supernatural beings from werewolves, to witches, to reapers, and more. And, she‚Äôs one of them. Except, no one seems to know just what she is.Living with a wolf pack isn‚Äôt easy. They are all touchy feely and Ember abhors being touched. She adjusts and soon becomes a part of the rambunctious family.It was a lot of fun getting to know the pack. It doesn‚Äôt take long to recognize who‚Äôs who. They really do have two natures, and they seem to blend together.Lots of questions to be answered. What happened twelve years ago? Why can‚Äôt anyone remember? What does the Grove know? And why is Ember alive when she‚Äôs supposed to be dead?I usually fly through books, especially those I loved as much as this one. Yet, at just over 500 pages, it took me several days. I did have to sleep and show up for work. But, the book stayed with me. I thought about it while at work, wondering about the answers I‚Äôd get. I‚Äôd crawl into bed at night, determined to stay awake and finish it, falling asleep and startling awake when the book fell out of my hands.What‚Äôs funny is, as anxious as I was to get to the end, once I got there, I didn‚Äôt want it to end. I was that into it. That connected to the characters. And I loved the world the author created.The good news is there‚Äôs another book in the series coming out in 2016. I‚Äôll be waiting for it.One for all fantasy fans, no matter your age.I received this book for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DY02VHHIK7HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692498729#wasThisHelpful","R3DY02VHHIK7HB","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jack McBride has a past. A wife who‚Äôs AWOL and a defunct career with the FBI. He leaves all the rumors behind and takes a job as chief of police in the small town of Stillwater, hoping for less crime and more time to devote to his son, Ethan.What Jack doesn‚Äôt expect is a staged crime scene of murder/suicide, and a cold case rising from the grave when skeletal remains are uncovered in the woods. No coasting along in this town. He‚Äôs neck deep in rumors, gossip, conspiracy, and suspicions.Ethan may be only thirteen years old and labeled a troublemaker, but what I see is a chip off the old block. He has his father‚Äôs curiosity, penchant for seeing through the lies, and a natural talent at observing people and scenes. He‚Äôs confused about his mother‚Äôs disappearance, and angry at his father, always testing him, but he knowsJack loves him and begins to see that as they adjust to their new life.I don‚Äôt want to forget Ellie Martin. She grew up in Stillwater and knows everybody and pretty much everything that‚Äôs happened there. She‚Äôs had a rough life, but she‚Äôs moving on, starting her own business and leaving all the bad behind. She hopes.Jack turns to Ellie for help with the towns history and denizens, and is surprised to feel a growing attracting towards her. He can‚Äôt seem to stop thinking about herEllie isn‚Äôt wanting anything to do with Jack. He‚Äôs big city, she‚Äôs small town. He‚Äôs got a questionable marriage status and she‚Äôs recovering from a really bad one. But, she can‚Äôt seem to stop thinking about him either.Hmm, me thinks a romance is happening whether either of them wants it or not. I love those kind. Leads to all kinds of humorous dialogue and situations. Lightens the mood and gives you something more to hope for.I wish I was good at explaining. This book doesn‚Äôt have many big action scenes all through it. There‚Äôs a lot of meet and greet and following the main characters. getting to know them, learning what makes them tick. It‚Äôs compelling. That‚Äôs the word. The writing is so good you‚Äôre compelled to keep reading. It doesn‚Äôt feel slow or boring. It keeps you reading, seeking answers, hoping for what you want to happen to really happen.A solid mystery. Genuine characters. Compelling writing. It all works to give you a great read.I received this book for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HFX5K3UFPHGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1634502264#wasThisHelpful","R1HFX5K3UFPHGP","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Sasquatch! Yancy Lazarus meets Big Foot. How could I not love this book.Yancy has charmed me from the very beginning. Not by his looks, he‚Äôs okay. Not by his smoking and drinking, does way too much of that. And definitely not because of his behavior. But, in spite of it.Now, he‚Äôs teamed up with a sasquatch who needs his help. Seems one of his kind has gone off the rails, munching on flesh, cannibalizing his own species, and liking it too much.Now, these beings like their privacy. They‚Äôve managed to stay secluded, with everyone believing they don‚Äôt exist. One rogue sasquatch could put them on the front page and here comes the hunters. Not good at all.In comes the big bad Wendigo. If it isn‚Äôt one thing, it‚Äôs another, and the state of Montana may be one big ghost town if Yancy doesn‚Äôt take care of it.If that isn‚Äôt enough, Yancy‚Äôs still trying to stop the supernatural beings and their plans for armageddon.When I wasn‚Äôt snortin with laughter, I was talking out loud. Cheering Yancy on. The poor guy just wants a break. Some time off to smoke, drink, and jam some blues. Not today, YancyAs with the first two books, I ate this up. The author kept the suspense ramped up, threw in some new supernatural beings, put Yancy through the wringer, and continued to make me laugh.I‚Äôve been thinking about who should play the part of Yancy if there were a movie. I‚Äôm going with Russell Crow or Gerard Butler. Picture them in Gladiator and The 300.Still lovin Yancy Lazarus, and still wanting more.I received this book for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F9WSTMCR34KP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163REPD6#wasThisHelpful","R2F9WSTMCR34KP","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again, Yancy Lazarus is on the job.He‚Äôd like nothing better than to enjoy some good blues music, chain smoke some cigarettes, and throw back some shots, chasing them with a few beers. But nope. Instead he has to rescue some kid who‚Äôs been kidnapped and dragged below to the Winter regions.It‚Äôs no pick-nick there. lots of tunnels, bitter cold, and some really nasty Fae that want to eat him for dinner.Known as the Fix-It man, it‚Äôs just another case and with a few bumps and bruises, and spilled blood, Yancy takes care of business. Except, it doesn‚Äôt stop there.Things are hinky. Others are scheming to open the supernatural gates, inviting in all manner of beasts. Can‚Äôt be good for mankind, or Yancy. It‚Äôs gonna get tricky without his VIS, his powers.Aah, Yancy. You can‚Äôt help but love him. He‚Äôs not a good catch. Smokes too much. Drinks too much. And kind of lazy. And he‚Äôs a lot older than he looks. But there‚Äôs something about him. Once you get past his smart mouth, you find he has a large heart, even though he tries to hide it behind a cavalier attitude. I‚Äôm thinking a lot of you men can relate with Yancy.Like the first book, the action is wild, the beings are out of this world, in more ways than one, and Yancy charms you yet again.Sorry Mom. I know you warned me about the bad boys. But, I just love Yancy.And I love this series. I sure you hope you give it a try.

"The blurb ends with this question, ‚ÄúWhat could possibly go wrong?‚Äù Well, plenty can and does.The zombie apocalypse has come and gone, for the most part. People now know vampires and werewolves exist.Zombies are in camps, kept contained for our and their protection.The vampires live in poverty, struggling just to exist as their numbers dwindle towards extinction.And the werewolves live deep in the swamps and jungles, trying to avoid man at all costs.When one man‚Äôs vision offers all of these beings a safe place to live and improve their station, they take his offer, one way or the other.Imagine Jurassic Park, but not dinosaurs. Instead you get zombies, werewolves, and vampires. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôd probably buy a ticket.When you add important people and a bunch of kids to opening night, your mind should buzz with what could happen. With what could go wrong.

"I‚Äôve become fascinated by zombies and apocalyptic stories. I love The Walking Dead and the show has helped me to visualize lots of scenes. From funny to gruesome. .The author yanks you right into the apocalypse. Barely time to breath before they are everywhere. .While I love the zombies, what really grabbed me in this story was the group dynamics. Ever seen the movie The Postman with Kevin Costner?.Similar to the movie, you have opposite sides on the apocalypse. Those who want to help others and those who want to use others to save themselves. It comes as no surprise that some people choose to force their will on others, even to the point of killing..Krista lost her parents to the zombies and was out there alone. When she does find a safe haven, she feels lucky, even though she‚Äôs assigned a job as a maid to one of the top governing families. Anything is better than being out there, right? And the zombies don‚Äôt like the humidity and heat of the south, so there aren‚Äôt many around..She can‚Äôt believe her luck when she finds she has a living relative. He‚Äôs an officer in the military, if you can call it that anymore, and she jumps at a chance to go with him and fight for her new world..This is where the dynamics come in. Either place might have been safe for a while. But with leaders who are looking out for themselves first, trying to lord it over everyone else, and practically relegating them to slaves, there‚Äôs bound to be some discontent. And sooner or later something has to give..There‚Äôs plenty of zombie action and intrigue to keep the story moving quickly. Genuine characters that you‚Äôll like or loath. And a satisfying ending. Not that it‚Äôs really the end. The author wraps up this chapter, but from the conclusion, I figure there will be more stories to come. I sure hope so.I received this book for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V7J176ZRUZ3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0172HWSGW#wasThisHelpful","R1V7J176ZRUZ3F","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was such a delightful read.Each message is displayed through wonderful illustrations on glossy pages along with thought provoking insight into how to be true to yourself and reminding you to treat others as you would want to be treated.Not just for young children, these lessons are ones we should all heed and live by. We are reminded that everyone is important, has feelings, hopes, and dreams. There‚Äôs more to life than just another day.My mother read this book and had this to say, ‚ÄúA gorgeous book.

"This is tagged as a suspense. thriller and that‚Äôs exactly what it is.Josephine Back, a reporter who‚Äôs focus is on science and climate change, comes under attack by some very powerful corporations.Global warming is a touchy subject and many in the fossil fuel business don‚Äôt want it to be legitimized. Big brother at work again.She finds an unlikely ally in Bennett Mills. As they probe behind the red tape, they stumble into dangerous waters. Soon, they are in a race to expose those behind horrific events before they are silenced, permanently.Right from the beginning, the story intrigues you. The suspense builds slowly, leading you into the many pots and subplots. As the action builds, so does the thrills.I was particularly drawn to this story because of the topic of climate change. It‚Äôs being argued that mere humans can‚Äôt affect the globe. That global warming is a scare tactic by radical and those with their own agendas.I feel differently. Do the research. Explore the information that‚Äôs out there. I can‚Äôt see how we‚Äôre not affecting this planet.While the plot was serious, it did have some humorous scenes. I guess I‚Äôm a bit macabre. There were two scenes where what started as scare tactics turned into tragedy. The two interrogators made me think of the movie Fargo. If anything could go wrong, it did.You‚Äôll feel this author‚Äôs passion about climate change, experience reporting from the inside with Jo, enjoy the dialogue between Bennett and Jo and there burgeoning romance, and cross your fingers that they emerge safely and all of the bad guys get their just desserts.I received this book for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ILY0VAD0LCLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508943451#wasThisHelpful","R1ILY0VAD0LCLT","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve read the thrilling excerpt for this book already. There‚Äôs no way I can describe this book any better.I can say that, while this isn‚Äôt the first book in this series, I jumped right in and had no problems following it.Being a fan of character driven stories, I found some strong ones here.The main protagonist, Lance Underphal, isn‚Äôt your typical one. He‚Äôs no longer in his fifties, has a bad heart, and is still grieving over the loss of his beloved wife, who visits him from time to time..He has met a new woman, one who might help fill that gaping hole, give him another chance at love. But first he has to solve a case. One that‚Äôs rife with unsavory characters. From deadly bikers, to corrupt police, Lance will need some friends if he‚Äôs to catch a killer and survive despite the bad odds.The paranormal elements had me fascinated. There‚Äôs more than one ghost haunting Lance. He‚Äôs a psychic and not surprised by that. If only some of them didn‚Äôt scare the crap out of him. They aren‚Äôt all pretty and glowing when they appear, and some have their own agendas, dark ones.The writing is excellent. I came really close to seeing the movie as I read it. Vivid detail and imagination put me in the thick of it. I got creeped out in several places. Especially at a nasty, run down house.  The author didn‚Äôt hold my hand. He made me smell the awful stench of the place. Hear the scurrying of thousands of roaches. Feel the evil presence fouling it.There‚Äôs such a great bunch of characters too. Aside from Lance and his ghostly wife, Sonja, there‚Äôs his new love interest, Callie. She‚Äôs no shrinking violet and has her own little paranormal talents.Then there‚Äôs Lance‚Äôs friend, Detective Frank Salmon. He‚Äôs stoic yet fierce when his friends are threatened. Reminds me Hodges from Criminal Minds. Doesn‚Äôt say much and rarely smiles unless he‚Äôs around his wife, Lacey. She‚Äôs a nurturer with lots of patience.Can‚Äôt forget Jake Jacobs, a federal private investigator. He‚Äôs a huge bear of a man and I could just picture him and his lady friend, Laura. She‚Äôs a bit older, sassy, and such a tiny thing. I had such fun with these two.Things get so much worse for Lance. It appears he‚Äôs being accused of the negligent death of his wife by her sister and she‚Äôs also suing him.The bad things keep on coming and Lance just hopes his heart can take it.I got thrills and chills, plenty of mystery, and more than one plot to follow. All made for an excellent read. You can bet I‚Äôll be going back to the beginning of this series now.I received this book for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SKSVSXN17F85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502705656#wasThisHelpful","R2SKSVSXN17F85","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved everything about this book. From the different points of view to the different dates in time to the fantastic illustrations and the hair raising creepiness.When I reached the end of this book, Onyx Webb was still an enigma to me. I know there are many more episodes to come and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll figure her out. The jury is still out about her right now.Ever wanted to know how it felt to be a ghost? From what I learned in this book, it‚Äôs no fun. Can‚Äôt taste, can‚Äôt feel, and can‚Äôt love. Why stick around? This story will tell you why.Taking place in different time periods, all of the characters start their stories here and it‚Äôs promised by the authors that following episodes will reveal their full stories and bring all of the characters together.For now, I‚Äôm just getting to know Onyx and her father Catfish, rich boy Koda Mulvaney and his best friend Dane, Quinn Cole and his missing sister Juniper, and a slew of secondary characters.I‚Äôve read other books written in episodes but not quite like this. The characters stories span many centuries but it‚Äôs easy to follow them as their voices speak clearly. And there are several mysteries happening at different times and I have no clue how they‚Äôll all come together.I also knew there wouldn‚Äôt be an ending in this book, so no surprise there. And that‚Äôs the ‚Äòhook.‚Äô I was hooked from the first chapter, compelled to keep reading, and in no hurry to finish.The illustrations are spectacular and the writing is easy to follow. Not what you‚Äôd expect at all with the story occurring in several different time periods and told from many points of view.Trying to label this, I‚Äôd call this a ghost story and a mystery. Maybe adding a dash of historical too. With lots of showing and some telling. Short chapters that make the read fly. And I believe I already mentioned the illustrations. They are all through the book and ‚Äòtell‚Äô a story too.There are several more books to come, each containing three episodes. You can bet I‚Äôm off to grab the second book now and will be watching for others as they are released.I received this book for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDWDRSNYS0QWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990751813#wasThisHelpful","RDWDRSNYS0QWD","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has all the makings for a good mystery.A family torn apart by tragedy, isolation on a private island, toxic spills, murder, stalkers, and all of this might possibly be connected to a mysterious history. I was hooked already!Being a fan of character driven stories, this didn‚Äôt disappoint.There‚Äôs Faye Longchamp ‚Äì Mantooth. She‚Äôs coping the only way she knows how after a terrible loss. She spends every waking minute and most nights prowling the island and doing random digs. Not herself at all. Being a professional archaeologist, she knows better. You need to investigate, do the math, before digging. I think she‚Äôs just trying to stay numb.Her husband, Joe Wolf Mantooth, is such a gentle soul. He loves his wife and patiently waits for her to come around, knowing she needs time to grieve and heal. In the meantime, he takes care of their young son, Michael, making sure he‚Äôs happy and loved.  When things go wiggy and bodies start adding up, he goes into alpha mode. I loved the gentle bear and the warrior spirit of Joe.Joe‚Äôs father, Sly Mantooth, out after serving time in prison, shows up on their doorstep and they invite him to stay awhile. Faye hopes the two will stay out of her hair, and Joe‚Äôs looking to get reconnected with his father. I like Sly. He‚Äôs a diamond in the rough. He keeps his thoughts to himself, unless a pretty gal is around. Then the charmer, the ladies man, comes out to play. There was one particular lady I wanted him to get better acquainted with. I hoped the author would grant my wish.Not just a murder mystery, there‚Äôs also the mystery of Faye‚Äôs ancestor. Some people want to prove her great-great-grandmother Cally was a murderer. Faye‚Äôs having none of it and launches her own investigation, keeping their relationship secret while she works to clear Cally‚Äôs name. Not so easy when you‚Äôre going back 150 years.A strange toxic find on the island, chemical dumps in the gulf, murder and violent attacks. Could all of this be random events or do they all tie together? I couldn‚Äôt wait to find out.Though this is the ninth book in the Faye Longchamp Mystery Series, it can easily be read as a stand alone. I‚Äôve not the read the other books and with some short mentions of past events, had no trouble reading this first.Good clean fun, with no sex scenes or foul language.I received this book for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31HAOR1J6GT5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464204047#wasThisHelpful","R31HAOR1J6GT5Y","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An excellent ladder. I especially like the platform. The ladder that originally came with my pool didn't have one and you had to step over the pool edge to get to the inside rungs. It felt unsafe and made me nervous. This ladder also has taller hand holds and feels much safer. I'll probably buy another so I have a spare for when I have company.

"The first book in this series had me on the edge of my seat. The action was intense and the scares were awesome.The second book was just as, if not more, intense. And the bodies piled up.Between those first two books, you lose some beloved characters and some not so loved.So, now for the third book in the Dinosaur Lake series.I started this book feeling a bit worried. After the first two, I wondered if the author could keep up the intense action and suspense. She didn‚Äôt disappoint. In fact, this may be the most nail biting of them all.The dinosaurs are rampant with a capital R! They are everywhere, in many shapes and sizes. And, of course, they are very hungry.Chief Park Ranger Henry Shore and his wife, Ann, have made it through many dangerous encounters with these monsters over several years, losing friends and hope. They managed to triumph, but this time they might not be so lucky.Dinosaurs are emerging again. So many, so hungry, so unstoppable. It‚Äôs not just the park and their town in danger anymore. The dinosaurs are popping up all over the US and Canada and who knows whether this will become a worldwide phenomenon. It may be the beginning of the age of dinosaurs again.I have to applaud Kathryn. She gave me more dinosaurs. Bigger, meaner ones, and sneaky, littler ones. The scenes of carnage were bloody wild and so many of them. I got all the action I could ever want.And the characters. Well, there are my favorites, mentions of loved ones lost, and some new ones. I was crossing fingers and toes that my favorites would survive. You never know with this author.I sure hope there are more books coming in this series. Please let there be more!While this is the third book in the series, you could easily pick up the story here. But, if you are a fan of action, intense suspense, and monsters, you‚Äôll want to, need to, go back and read the other books.I received this book for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A26HPJB3O19N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RO538IU#wasThisHelpful","R2A26HPJB3O19N","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We now know we are not alone. Our first contact with aliens is a friendly one. Good thing too, as the next ones to visit are on a mission to destroy our way of life. To erase us from existence.Teaming up with our new friends is a necessity. We‚Äôll need their help, their technology, if we hope to have even the slightest chance to repel the invaders.The authors own experience flying an Apache Attack Helicopter in combat lends realism to the scenes. Especially when Captain Jake Giard has to pull some extraordinary maneuvers to evade the alien spaceships.Jake has a lot of baggage. The loss of his best friend in a flight training session is traumatic enough. Then, the blame is laid on his shoulders. Blending science fiction with apocalyptic scenarios, the author keeps you sharp and on edge, just like the characters. You‚Äôll have a front row seat in the jets, almost feel your stomach flip flop with the g- forces.The friendly aliens have some surprises, some secrets, which, when shared, shed a whole new light on humanity and our origins.And the not so friendly aliens, the ones trying to take over our planet and annihilate us, they have some nasty tricks up their sleeves.Lots of action, and, as with any type of military action story, lots of acronyms. Don‚Äôt worry about those. The author explains them and you catch on pretty quickly. I feel they add a certain amount of genuineness to the story.Looking for some exciting science fiction and post apocalyptic hellish adventure.

"I‚Äôve been reading this series for years and finished reading the last two books, Bone Bed and Dust, just in time for Flesh And Blood.This is one of those series that never gets old. Some people might see that there are 22 books and not want to start them. Don‚Äôt let that number turn you off. You‚Äôll be wanting more new ones after you taste these.It‚Äôs a beautiful morning. The charcoal is almost ready for Kay to start grilling, Benton is reading the newspaper, and in just a few hours they‚Äôll be flying to Florida for her birthday. Until‚Ä¶Good thing these two understand that their jobs aren‚Äôt 5 to 9. They‚Äôre always on call. So when the phone rings, Kay packs her crime scene bag and heads off to a murder. Benton, in the meantime, has a few things to take care of too. First is what‚Äôs up with the copper coins on their patio wall? Who left them? What do they mean? And the reflection he spotted in the woods, could it be a sniper?Looks like Florida will have to wait.If I was asked what I liked most about this book, I‚Äôd be stumped. The plot is filled with suspense. Copper coins, a terrorist, a serial sniper, and a possible stalker. Lots to keep you guessing.Then there‚Äôs the characters. I love Kay and Benton. From the very first book, I wanted these two to be together. Lots of cases and lots of secrets kept them apart for a long time. Even though they‚Äôre married now, they still have a spicy relationship. There‚Äôs never a dull moment with them, whether working or just being together.About Detective Pete Merino. Pete‚Äôs one of those surly, my way or the highway guys. He worked with Kay until he was lured back to police work. He still acts like they‚Äôre working together. He‚Äôll call and say he‚Äôs got a case and he‚Äôs on his way, so be ready when he gets there. It works, since Kay usually gets called to the same crime scenes he does. It‚Äôs fun to see them fall into the comfortable working relationship. She anticipates him, kind of knows what he‚Äôs going to do or say before he does it. And ditto for Pete.And last but certainly not least is Lucy, Kay‚Äôs niece. She‚Äôs a technical geek, one of the best, likes to drive fast cars, and flies a helicopter. Kay and Lucy are like mother and daughter, or siblings. They squabble, they worry, they rely on each other. And they always have each others back.All of these characters are dear to my heart. I cross my fingers when I read each new book, hoping they get through it in one piece. All of them have went to the dark side, and some barely made it out.So, what did I like best? Everything.I received this book for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I5NCB97597PV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062325353#wasThisHelpful","R3I5NCB97597PV","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was listening to the morning news while finishing up my review of this book when I happened to overhear the newscaster mention it was the 10th anniversary since Hurricane Katrina made landfall.I‚Äôm sure everyone remembers that day. Whether you were in the path of the storm or not, all eyes and ears were tuned to the storm.I live on the Gulf Coast and have been through many hurricanes. We were hit by Ivan the year before Katrina. I ran from that storm and when they allowed us back in, I held my breath as I neared my home. I knew something was wrong when I could see our pool. Shouldn‚Äôt have been able to. Luckily it was because of the many downed trees. I lost nine, with the huge pecan tree taking out my porch and the neighbors barn. I had to cut a path though the branches to enter my house. I was lucky.The people in Louisiana were not so lucky. The storm and it‚Äôs surge were bad enough. But when the levees broke, it was a disaster of epic proportions.I was fascinated to read of this families ordeal, from the night of the storm up til now. Imagine running from the storm, finding a safe place to wait it out, and seeing the devastation after those levees broke. Not knowing if your house is even still there. Not being allowed back in. And seeing all of those people, trapped and helpless.Not only did these people have to leave their home, they had to find somewhere else to live and find a school for their two young children. Even once they are allowed home and find their house still intact, they can‚Äôt stay there. There‚Äôs no running to the grocery store, because they are closed or gone. No schools for the same reason.Relying on friends, family, and the kindness of strangers, they found adequate housing and food. Now, they just have to figure out what comes next.I couldn‚Äôt begin to imagine what it was like. Sure, they didn‚Äôt lose their home, but they now had no jobs, not much money, and had to keep paying the bills, plus pay for two homes.And the ripples of Hurricane Katrina are still being felt. I‚Äôve seen footage of the progress that‚Äôs been made on rebuilding. But I know a few families that never went back. They lost everything.I‚Äôll be visiting New Orleans next month for the first time since Katrina. I‚Äôve never been there before so I can‚Äôt see a before and after, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll see plenty of the after evidence even after 10 years.I was riveted from beginning to end, and applaud Lisa Karlin and her family for sharing their story.I received this book for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2854B3UH2QCQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0996232702#wasThisHelpful","R2854B3UH2QCQA","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She thinks she doesn‚Äôt wanted her magic. Doesn‚Äôt want to be a witch. And she keeps her demon half locked down inside her. All of this frustration and anger find a way out sometimes, like a pot boiling over.It seems like every time Syd makes up with her mother, something else happens and she‚Äôs screaming how much she hates her, the family, the coven, her powers, and witches. She wants out and doesn‚Äôt want to wait until she‚Äôs 18 to give up her power.After a huge blow out with her mother, Syd‚Äôs dad is waiting for her. When she enters the basement, both of her parents are there, but her uncle butts into the family meeting. He insists they stop lying to Syd. Tell her the truth. She needs to get control of her demon now more than ever.Syd‚Äôs never whiney. She grows strong as she learns more, faces herself and her demon. Embraces her power. The author keeps her in character, genuine and believable. She‚Äôs a teenager and stays one, showing her growth, her confusion, her determination, and her doubts.As the end of the book drew near, I became worried. I couldn‚Äôt see how it would all work out.

And that‚Äôs Seth.Can Ella have a happy ever after? Or will her evil step family spoil her plans? Will Seth want a lowly maid ? Or will he want one of the snotty step-sisters? And can he see her as a protector, not a killer?All of my questions are answered, and in such fun and delightful ways. Ella is no lightweight and she has some awesome friends who love and support her.Seth, weighed down by responsibility, by proper appearances, steps into the shoes assigned to him with strength and fortitude.And then there‚Äôs the zombie thing. The author offered a fresh take on them. I didn‚Äôt quite see where she was heading until the end.

"I felt an instant connection to Alex. Not because he was in a wheelchair. But because he and his gang of friends were are all deemed worthless. Each of them had a tic, a disability that landed them in the neverland of Special Ed.I have a son with a social disabiilty. I can‚Äôt think of anything harder to deal with. Everything we do is social, is interaction with others. My heart broke one day. I was at the school to pick up my son and saw this boy coming down the hall.

He can‚Äôt do it to himself, only to others. Some powerful people know about his ability. They want it. They want him.

Things look all in order and Dan can steal some quality time with Elaine. Should be an easy wrap.That is until Elaine stumbles upon a stray dog while taking a walk and the dog has a clue in it‚Äôs mouth.I was drawn to this book because of the Greyhound racing. I live in Alabama and we don‚Äôt have horse racing, which I love. I was introduced to the Mobile Greyhound Racing Club and found it just as fun and exciting.

It‚Äôs more of an estate with the large forests and somewhat neglected mansion.First things first, Elle explores the house, finding rooms filled with beautiful antiques.  Then she walks the grounds, surrounded by heavy brush and trees, stumbling onto a graveyard filled with crumbling tombstones. Something peculiar catches her eye.

At first I couldn‚Äôt believe she‚Äôd stay in a haunted house. You‚Äôve seen the movies. Don‚Äôt go in the basement. Don‚Äôt go see what made that noise. Elle did all of those things. I had to keep reminding myself, if she didn‚Äôt there wouldn‚Äôt be much of  a story.And I remembered something. As a teenager, I was home alone and heard a loud crash in the basement. I did go down to see what it was. Granted, I was scared to go down those steps. But I was more scared not to. It turned out to be a cat that got in through an open window, jumping on a table and breaking something.It‚Äôs not that simple for Elle.There‚Äôs an Author‚Äôs Note after the end where Darcy Coates explains the origins of The Haunting Of Gillespie House.

"First I want to mention that this is the third book in this series. Don‚Äôt let that stop you from reading this out of order. The author smoothly provided back story in the right places without slowing down the story and I easily became familiar with the characters and previous events.Now to the book. How could I pass this up? A cozy mystery with the main character being a successful mystery writer.Victoria Rienzi, or Vic, returned to Oceanside on the Jersey shore a few months ago. She‚Äôs trying to write the next book in her mystery series while working in the families Italian restaurant, Casa Lido.The restaurant is preparing for it‚Äôs 70th anniversary, but it‚Äôs not looking to good. A storm is barreling down on New Jersey. Vic‚Äôs grandmother, Nonna, isn‚Äôt going to let a little ole hurricane ruin the outdoor dining and festivities. When the winds begin to bluster and the rain starts to fall, everyone is hustled inside to continue the celebration.Like all hurricanes, it blows through and the morning is bright and clear. There‚Äôs lots of power outages along with some damage, but it looks like everyone came through it okay. Until they find the body.Stinky Pete, the resident homeless man, is found dead at the historical carousel ride on the boardwalk. He was last seen after he stumbled into the restaurant celebration. Nonna gave him some food and water and guided away from the guests, sending him on his way.Vic isn‚Äôt convinced it‚Äôs an accidental drowning and she just can‚Äôt help herself. She has to stick her nose in the investigation, drawing Nonna‚Äôs wrath.  It‚Äôs not the first time Casa Lido has been  at the center of a murder investigation.One of my favorite parts of this book was the research. The research done by the characters. Vic and her sister-in-law, Sophie, dig deep and stumble upon a connection to Vic‚Äôs great uncle, Roberto. He was the black sheep in the family and thought to have died in Italy a long time ago.They make a list of suspects and the list keeps growing. I tell you, these ladies left no one off that list.And I have to hand it to Vic. I don‚Äôt know how she kept going. A deadline is looming on her new release, and she needs to get cracking on the next book. She ‚Äòs dealing with issues at the restaurant and at home due to lack of electricity. And she‚Äôs having to work alongside the man who broke her heart and sent her running away many years ago.Vic is persistent and starts asking questions, angering some people and setting herself up as a target.Love lost and found, people who want to keep their skeletons in their closets, and a possible mob connection kept this mystery rushing forward and kept me on my toes, right along with Vic. That, and her Nonna, who brooks no slacking and no nonsense.Good clean fun with lots of laughs and some intense scenes as the mystery unravels. Everything you need for a good cozy read.I received this book for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTBYGL0M7GIMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451415167#wasThisHelpful","RTBYGL0M7GIMS","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kazumi should feel lucky. She‚Äôs the only survivor of a plane crash that had over five hundred passengers. But she doesn‚Äôt. She feels lost, scared, hopeless. She‚Äôs lost her sense of self. Has no memory of who she is, where she comes from.A nurse at the hospital tries to help her. She senses Kazumi is more than she appears. When it‚Äôs time for her release from the hospital, Linda sneaks her away to some people who might be able to help her. With nothing left to lose, Kazumi, though scared, goes along with it.Deep inside the Rocky Mountains is a secret society of super humans, genetically advance people called Sarcomeres. Their enhanced strength and high tech toys fascinate Kazumi and she quickly becomes a part of the society.Quick to learn, she trains diligently, preparing for the daunting tests to come.She‚Äôll need to learn quickly as the Sarcomeres old enemy, the Neuronics, are plotting world supremacy over humans and all other beings. Subterfuge, attacks, and Kazumi‚Äôs own hidden memories could bring about a catastrophe.I should mention that Kazumi is referred to as Gabi for much of this book. The name was chosen for her in the hospital as she couldn‚Äôt remember her real one.This books is intended for young adult readers, and as I‚Äôm much older, I worried if I‚Äôd appreciate it. I sure did. I enjoy science fiction and dystopian stories and this is a bit of both.Kazumi is a scrappy young gal. She‚Äôs a quick study, bold, and still a bit girly. Especially around Finn.The Sarcomeres stay hidden from society. Not because they are bad, but because of what they are and what they fight.The Neuronics. Nasty beasts for sure. They can envelop you with their tentacles, reach into your mind and body, and control what you see and do. Quite creepy, indeed. And what‚Äôs a good villain without a plot to take over the world.There‚Äôs lots of world building, but it flows easily in the story. The characters come to life with some well written descriptions. And the action is fast and furious.Almost forgot. There are some sub plots too. A big one is about Kazumi‚Äôs past.Young and mature fans of these genres will enjoy this new series.I received this book for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GXDN4DTPPT62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9YY5B0#wasThisHelpful","R3GXDN4DTPPT62","A1CGOR398UH1IB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CGOR398UH1IB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Based on blind faith, first-time documentary filmmaker Jeremy Ambers followed the uncertain path from conception to execution of the Bay Lights. At a height of 500 feet and a length of 1.8 miles, it represents the world's largest LED light sculpture installed on the much-maligned western span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. He really had no idea if the project would reach a successful conclusion, and that ambivalence is captured in the compelling narrative he follows for just 71 minutes. Ambers wisely focuses on three key figures, the first being Ben Davis, the founder of the Illuminate the Arts program and the guiding light, if you will, of the entire project. It was his dream to have a public art display that would allow some of the spotlight normally reserved for the more photogenic Golden Gate Bridge. This dream evolves into a vision created by the film's second pivotal figure, expressionist artist Leo Villareal, whose renown comes from elaborate lighting displays.Many of his exhibits are shown here with the most famous being the stunning concourse walkway between the West and East buildings of the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. The third figure is Amy Critchett, a no-nonsense creative producer instrumental in the budgeting and fundraising efforts to bring the project to life. While a number of engineers were obviously critical to the effort and are included in brief snippets, it is the combined effort of this charismatic trio who manages to elicit support from a wide-ranging and often hesitant group of stakeholders from government agencies to private anonymous donors . Interspersed between the interviews is some remarkable footage of the installation including setbacks caused by either the elements or the experimental nature of the whole venture. Ambers shows a true gift for editing as the momentum never flags, and the evocative score by Kevin T. Doyle lends a nicely surreal touch to the story. I look forward to Ambers' next feature film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R6990A3U0BO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MH666RQ#wasThisHelpful","R3R6990A3U0BO6","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jewels. Nothing but jewels. That the multi-hyphenate Barbra Streisand still has a voice that shimmers and resonates with such unparalleled melisma is not a surprise, and at 72, she delivers her trademark repertoire with a voice that has gained a burnished patina over the years but still ignites and thrills through her sheer musicality. On her 34th studio album, she takes on a dozen popular male singers of varying genres (save one case of outright nepotism) and dexterously matches each one of them note for note. Pop. Country. Jazz. Opera. Broadway. Bossa nova. It doesn't matter because she transcends them all and makes each song her own and all this from a woman who doesn't sing in the shower.The opener, Gus Kahn and Isham Jones' ""It Had to Be You"", features an ideal partner, aspiring Sinatra-styled crooner Michael Bubl√©, as it builds from a sonorous ballad to a jazzy back-and-forth display of big band panache. Fully expecting them to duet on his love song, ""All in Love Is Fair"", I was surprised she and Stevie Wonder chose to perform a bossa nova arrangement of ""People"". A refreshing reworking of her signature Act I number from Funny Girl, it floats on Wonder's effortless vocals and harmonica and Michael Ripoli's Brazilian-style guitar. Amazingly, it doesn't violate the integrity of the Jules Styne-Bob Merrill original, taking this chestnut on a different course entirely.The bluesy treatment on Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer's ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" brings out Streisand's affinity for languorous phrasing, and there is surprising Cotton Club-style chemistry with John Mayer, who provides an all-too-short guitar solo as an added bonus. Co-producer Kenny ""Babyface"" Edmonds duets with her on the self-penned perennial ""Evergreen"" subtly transformed from its original lullaby-like arrangement into a more heavenly choir piece. I have to admit Billy Joel's ""New York State of Mind"" sounds initially like a clash of the titans because of a slightly jarring change in tempo and volume when he starts to sing.However, they eventually find their groove when she reaches for her upper register to complement his raspier tone and ends in some playful dialogue and a few chords of Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"". Streisand has been singing country tunes for years because she seems fond of the storytelling approach and loping rhythms, and ""I'd Want It to Be with You"" fits the bill with Blake Shelton partnering with her with his sincere, aw-shucks manner intact. Ripoli's guitar returns in the R&B makeover of ""The Way We Were"", which sounds not too surprisingly like one of Lionel Richie's mid-80's hit ballads complete with Babyface's backing vocals. Richie sounds the most energized he has been in years by her presence.The touching duet with Andrea Bocelli is perhaps the most predictably affecting of the tracks with Streisand masterful in matching his booming operatic tenor with her innately theatrical nature on the decidedly old-fashioned ""I Can See Your Face"". In a bold act of nepotism that repeats the number they performed during her 2010 concert tour (captured on Back To Brooklyn), Streisand hands over the first two minutes of Irving Berlin's ""How Deep Is the Ocean"" completely to her son Jason Gould's yearning, sometimes overreaching vocal only to have mama bring it home in true style. Perhaps the most startling duet is on Barry Gibb and Albhy Galuten's ""What Kind of Fool"", the only number on the entire disc that was originally written as a duet.Beginning with a swelling orchestral overture, it becomes a powerfully dramatic ballad with John Legend's soulfully supple vocal replacing Gibb's familiar falsetto. Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim's ""Somewhere"" is Josh Groban's second duet with Streisand, and their experience together shows. She starts in an almost hushed tone at which point he builds upon her vocal power without trying to compete. Compare this with the bombast of Il Divo at her 2006 concerts, and you can appreciate the relative subtlety of this arrangement, which remains true to the spirit of the original show, ""West Side Story"", even more than her celebrated version on The Broadway Album.I have to admit I find the touching duet with Elvis Presley on ""Love Me Tender"" a bit spooky, much like Natalie Cole's ""Unforgettable"", though there's no denying the seamless blend in their voices even as she adds her particularly dramatic flourish to a simple classic. The Target Bonus Disk is worth seeking out for another duet with Babyface on another ""A Star Is Born"" song, her composition with Leon Russell, ""Lost Inside of You"", which is even better than the ""Evergreen"" track simply because it was written as a duet. Four other tracks from her 2002 Duets compilation are included here - ""I've Got a Crush on You"" with Sinatra, ""I Finally Found Someone"" with Bryan Adams, ""I Won't Be the One to Let Go"" with Barry Manilow, and ""Guilty"" with Barry Gibb. This is a most worthwhile purchase either way with Streisand in classic, barely diminished form.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KLR5JIVFPYGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIA0KGY#wasThisHelpful","R2KLR5JIVFPYGV","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Updating a classic as revered as Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story is no small feat, and it is left to former Ozu prot√©g√© YÙji Yamaha along with co-screenwriter Emiko Hiramatsu to contemporize a film that managed the magical feat of being simultaneously timeless and of its time (post-WWII Japan). Yamaha was 82 when he directed this overlong 2013 drama, and there is a sense of gravitas to his approach which could be seen as a respectful tribute to his mentor. However, what's missing is the deep sense of melancholy of the original, the delicate emotionalism which was well matched by empathetic performances from Ozu's regular players, chief among them the legendary Setsuko Hara's beautifully modulated turn as Noriko. This character has been relegated to a smaller role here, and this is just the beginning of the problems with the new film made exactly sixty years after the original.The plot follows the same basic framework. Retired teacher Shukichi Hirayama and his wife, Tomiko live on a small island near Hiroshima. They come visit their grown children in Tokyo for a few days. There were five children in the original film, the youngest a schoolteacher who lived with them. This time there are three, probably a more accurate demographic for current-day Japan, but like the first story, the elderly couple is shuttled around rather mercilessly by their children who are leading their own hectic lives. They first visit with elder son Koiichi, a local doctor, his wife and two kids. Then there is the snippy daughter Shigeko who has a buffoonish husband and runs a hair salon. Last is youngest son Shoji, a freelance set designer who barely scrapes by but doesn't seem to mind. Noriko is no longer a widow central to the story on her own but rather Shoji's hidden girlfriend, the one who eventually provides the bridge to his largely estranged parents.As anyone familiar with ""Tokyo Story"" will know, tragedy strikes, and the surviving family comes to terms with what remains of their elusive bonds with one another. Zeroing in on three children would lead one to believe deeper characterizations would follow, but Yamaha and Hiramatsu seem so intent in evoking the original story, the opportunities are lost. Even passing mentions of the Fukushima earthquake and the country's pallid economic state do little to make the story feel more vibrant and relevant. The cast is proficient but variable when it comes to lasting impact. As Shukichi, Isao Hashizume plays the role in a more standard curmudgeonly fashion than Ozu regular Chish≈´ Ry≈´, but Kazuko Yoshiyuki hits the right notes as Tomoko. Masahiko Nishimura plays Koichi even more stoically than S√¥ Yamamura did as the role remains elliptical at best.In the comparatively showy role of Shigeko, Tomoko Nakajima stands clearly in the shadow of the memorable Haruko Sugimura who could show respect, pettiness and conniving in a realistically mercurial fashion. However, former teen heartthrob Satoshi Tsumabuki manages to convey a palpable figure out of the puppyish Shoji who loves his mother but remains shaped by his father's disappointment. Yu Aoi has the unenviable task of stepping into Hara's shoes, though her sympathetic likeability gets her through her key final scene with Shukichi with surprising poignancy. It would have been unimaginable to conceive of an update that could approach the resonance of the original, and Yamaha proves that point with his overly deliberate pacing. Still, certain scenes like the heartfelt bedside chat between Tomoko and Shoji, well played by Yoshiyuki and Tsumabuki, make this worthwhile for a once-through.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MPMHAQTQE7ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F36Q8F2#wasThisHelpful","R2MPMHAQTQE7ID","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Known for bringing a hip edge to populist genre pictures that focus mainly on high-octane action with a heavy dose of U.S.-influenced pop culture, Luc Besson is a French filmmaker who directed some terrifically audacious films in the nineties (1994's L√©on: The Professional, 1997's The Fifth Element) but has largely focused on producing and writing since the millennium. He comes back to the director's chair with this 2013 mob comedy which bears his signature mark of extreme, almost fanatical violence within the context of a story that already feels unsettled as neither a crime melodrama nor a family situation comedy. With a screenplay co-written with Michael Caleo, Besson has made a tonally unbalanced film whose primary saving grace is an adroit cast headed by Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer. Neither is a stranger to this milieu as they appear to play extensions of characters they've already played in Goodfellas (which is given a cheeky nod in the plot) and Married to the Mob. That's fine by me since both bring a world-weary finesse to their portrayals that elevate the cartoonish movie into something close to human if not quite humane.The fancifully graphic story focuses on Giovanni Manzoni, his wife Maggie, their daughter Belle and their son Warren. He is a second-generation mobster who decides to turn state's evidence against Don Luchese, a Brooklyn crime kingpin. After a failed attempt to rub out Manzoni at a family barbecue, Luchese is sent to prison, and in turn, the Manzoni tribe enters the Witness Protection Program where they end up being renamed the Blakes and relocating from the south of France to a village in Normandy. Each family member has trouble fitting in because they all share the same volatile temper and the same immoral sensibility to solve any problem with brutalizing violence. Manzoni is Fred Blake who pretends to be a history author writing about the Normandy landings and beats up a plumber who tries to rip him off. In my favorite scene of the movie, Maggie blows up a local grocery store when the proprietor and local customers make fun of American vulgarity in French. Belle pummels a would-be lothario with a tennis racket after he tricks her into joining him and his buddies for a not-so-innocent picnic. Warren seeks revenge against the local school bullies by creating a confederacy of outcasts with sought-after skills and connections.All their proclivities come to a head when Luchese discovers their whereabouts through the most contrived of circumstances. De Niro can play this type of role in his sleep, but credit him for not making this another Fockers sleepfest as he brings genuine warmth to a character that finds a cathartic release in his newfound purpose in writing his memoirs. Even in her bleached blond flashbacks, Pfeiffer displays her shopworn beauty with little vanity and manages to create an empathetic character out of what could have been a shrewish caricature. Tommy Lee Jones plays exactly to type as the stoic agent who leads the protection detail for Manzoni. Glee alumnus Dianna Agron brings a refreshing calmness to the role of a bad girl who is at heart a soulful teen falling in love for the first time while never forgetting her obligation to the family. John D'Leo fits well into the deadpan demeanor of a been-there, done-that kid brother as Warren. But Besson just doesn't know how to mesh the considerable comic chops of his core cast with the violence he wants to showcase, especially in the final gun battle sequence, which would have been fine in a straight-ahead actioner but just refuses to bring this truly absurdist movie together. It's a marginal disappointment considering all who is involved in this production including executive producer Martin Scorsese.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ML9SQ1PII2J9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRILRL6#wasThisHelpful","R1ML9SQ1PII2J9","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw the trailer for this rambunctious 2013 action comedy, I was none too excited to see this film despite the expert hands involved, specifically co-stars Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy and director Paul Feig in his sophomore feature after the surprise smash of 2011's Bridesmaids which featured McCarthy in her breakout role. Interestingly, it is not her unapologetically rapacious turn as Megan that serves as the inspiration for McCarthy's role as pugnacious Boston detective Shannon Mullins. I think it's the hilariously crazy rant she unspooled as the mad-as-hell mother in the outtake shown during the end credits of Judd Apatow's This Is 40. This sharp comic actress is a master of timing, and her character's nasty-edged tirades produce pure comedy gold. She and Bullock generate real chemistry as a mismatched pair of social misfits who are thrown together to take down a Boston drug lord. As written by Kate Dippold, the film is little different in premise from any other cop-buddy actioner made since 48 Hrs. and Lethal Weapon. The novelty is that they're women. In that respect, it does resemble a distaff version of the Will Ferrell-Mark Wahlberg 2010 comedy, The Other Guys.Bullock plays straight-arrow FBI agent Sarah Ashburn who is gunning for a promotion based on her enviable track record of captures, but the problem is nobody in her department can stand working with her due to her arrogance. Her boss sends her to Boston to work on the drug case and also her people skills. Mullins is Ashburn's polar opposite, a fear-based cop who knows the neighborhoods that Ashburn desperately needs to search. Just as Ashburn wears no-nonsense pantsuits, Mullins looks like a streetwise biker with her worn Paw Sox T-shirt and fingerless leather gloves. The movie consists mostly of their personal embattlements as each can't stand the other, but hints of mutual respect lurk as Mullins sets up a diversion at a drug supplier's apartment while Ashburn picks up an incriminating cigarette butt. There's also a funny nightclub scene where Mullins cuts up Ashburn's outfit in the restroom to make her look sexy enough to distract a dealer while installing a tracking device into his smartphone. A hilariously executed drunken binge provides just the bonding moment they need to join forces to nab their prey. At the same time, Dippold's screenplay is not without its share of predictable elements.For example, Mullins has a fractious, mouthy family right out of The Fighter and a brother who could be a linchpin in the case (shades of Conviction). This gives her character a tether to humanity that appears a bit forced amid all the action. Moreover, after Mullins and Ashburn reach the turning point in their relationship, the plot doesn't seem to matter as much, and the pacing feels uneven. There are a surprising number of grisly moments including ones involving an oyster shucking knife and an unexpected tracheotomy, but these moments appear true to the genre. The 1970's-style credits are a plus as well as the rap-heavy soundtrack coordinated by Mike Andrews. Bullock is really playing another variation of Miss Congeniality only much more uptight, and while she does it very well, McCarthy steals almost every scene. Feig has surrounded them with an eclectic supporting cast including Demian Birchir (A Better Life) as Ashburn's patient boss, Tom Wilson as the prematurely aging precinct captain, a surprisingly dapper Marlon Wayans as a fellow FBI agent who has a crush on Ashburn, Jane Curtin in a too-brief role as Mullins' judgmental mother; and MADtv's Michael McDonald and SNL's Taran Killam in unexpected roles. Solid entertainment all around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYGZH8IVJQ5D2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8RKHWW#wasThisHelpful","RYGZH8IVJQ5D2","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If a youthful sense of hope informs Before Sunrise and a wistful sense of regret does the same in Before Sunset, then a begrudging sense of resignation must be the overriding theme of this 2013 romantic drama as director and co-screenwriter Richard Linklater picks up the story of Jesse and Celine 18 years after they first met on a train to Vienna. This time, they are an established couple though tellingly, still not married. Jesse indeed left his loveless marriage after the end of ""Before Sunset"", and the lovers are now in their early forties raising twin girls. For the second time, Linklater wrote the script with co-stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, and together they achieve a level of familiarity with their characters' relationship that makes the incidental story resonate in ways quite unexpected. Unlike the first two films, there is no ticking clock manufactured to provide a need for resolution by the end. Instead, the fate of the couple's relationship is entirely in their hands, and now that we have an emotional investment in the characters, that's what makes this entry more compelling.The movie flows leisurely picking up the particular rhythms of conversations that show how words can become weapons. The story begins at the end of an idyllic Greek vacation where the couple has been staying with friends of various generations. As Jesse puts his now-adolescent son Henry on a plane headed back to Chicago, it becomes clear that his ex-wife didn't take the divorce well and now has full custody of Henry. Jesse shares with Celine his struggle in being so far away from Henry, and they banter about the challenges of parenthood and her indecision around accepting a government job. You would think that the stage they are in their lives would not yield much in the way of romantic sparks, but when they meet their friends for a farewell meal, they return to their familiar selves as they discuss the challenges in making human, much less romantic, connections in the digital age. Their friends decide to treat them to a romantic night at a nearby hotel, and the dialogue comes back to just the two of them. The chemistry between them percolates in a subtle manner as they walk to the hotel stopping to ponder the sunset.Once at the hotel, the friction begins mildly when the front desk clerk, an effusive fan of Jesse's books, insists Celine autograph her copies. Although she obviously served as his inspiration, she had nothing to do with the writing and bristles at the request. Then a phone call from Chicago sets off tensions that had been simmering between the two about the possibility of moving away from Paris to Chicago. Their verbal combat scene has the brutal honesty and up-and-down rhythms that feel more realistic than most such fights depicted onscreen, and that's what makes the scene more powerful since things said in the most matter-of-fact way sting with inevitable consequences. Looking understandably worn, Hawke and Delpy know their characters and each other's so well they don't need to sketch out a backstory. We've already seen it, and together with Linklater, they've written it and perhaps will continue to shape their future. The director and actors continue to evolve as much as the characters do. So where will Jesse and Celine as 50-year-olds be? Chicago perhaps...""Before Tomorrow"" maybe?","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R171FI8351DHVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJYJPLO#wasThisHelpful","R171FI8351DHVE","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The emotional complexity of the lead characters in this 1950 film noir is what continues to surprise about this low-budget B-movie that has understandably become a cult classic among cineastes. As cannily directed by Joseph H. Lewis, there is a feral, white-heat energy that fuels this film from start to finish. Lewis manages to make the film jump back and forth from documentary-like to highly stylized with quicksilver cuts, the sum of which somehow melds together into a crazy-great melodrama that clearly serves as the precursor for later couple-on-the lam movie classics such as Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde and Terrence Malick's Badlands.  Written by Dalton Trumbo (under a pseudonym as he was blacklisted at the time), the story is pretty basic. Bart Tare is an orphan whose obsession with handguns starts pretty early in his life. Motivated by what he sees as his own self-worth, he becomes an expert sharpshooter as he moves from reform school to a stint in the Army and then to an uncertain existence as Bart isn't sure what he's supposed to do with his life.Enter Annie Laurie Starr, a dead-shot trick-shooter who comes to town as part of a traveling carnival, and the fireworks ignite immediately when she shoots at him with a prop gun and then competes in a marksmanship contest where each shoots matchsticks on a crown placed on the other's head. This audacious bit of foreplay is only the beginning when he impulsively decides he wants to marry her, and in turn, she convinces him to go on a cross-country crime spree to live the life of Riley. He willingly goes along with the plan, but self-doubt strikes him at every adverse turn. Annie, on the other hand, is a classic ""bad"" girl who shoots people dead out of an addictive fear of getting trapped, but she genuinely falls in love with Bart when she recognizes how much he is willing to sacrifice of himself to be with her. Their torturous relationship is offset by some fascinating set pieces like an unedited bank robbery scene near the film's midpoint where the camera is planted in the backseat of a car the couple has just stolen. The actors feel like they're improvising their dialogue during a single take of several minutes' duration.The robbery occurs off-camera, and after she pistol-whips a local cop, the two get away as shots are fired at them. Their clean escape is captured perfectly in Annie's face as she smiles in an almost post-coital fashion that summarizes the dark nature of her character perfectly. The actors give blazing performances that make indelible impressions. John Dall is an interesting footnote in mid-century American cinema as he only made a handful of films, the most famous being Alfred Hitchcock's Rope where he played one of a pair of gay murderers. As Bart, he conveys his character's constant self-doubt and false bravado with precision, even if he does seem over-the-top in a few key scenes. A petite Welsh-born beauty, Peggy Cummins was supposed to be a big star three years earlier when she was cast in Forever Amber. But she was fired and never gained a footing in American films until this one where she dazzles with a Bette Davis-like intensity but with a deceptively demure manner that makes her portrayal surprisingly sympathetic. This is a gem well worth seeking out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUUMDL4Y4IZGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000244EWY#wasThisHelpful","RUUMDL4Y4IZGL","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was inadvertently watching what I thought was a documentary short about a boy whose feet were damaged by a lawn mower only to discover it was part of an infomercial about Thorlo socks. Given the fact that I had been experiencing some lingering pain on the balls and heels of my feet, I was lured into getting three pairs of the men's dress socks for work. The increase in comfort has been noticeable, and the padding has not caused the inconvenience I was fearing would occur in my shoes. My usual pressure points were dulled by the padding, and I'm not a reticent about taking longer strolls on the pavement.

"The irony of the film's title is that there isn't any, gravity that is, but that's not to say it lacks gravitas. It does in ways both unexpected and transcendent. It's been seven long years since Alfonso Cuar√≥n's last film, 2006's emotionally propulsive thriller, Children of Men, which was a masterful work of suspense in the midst of one seriously dystopian vision of the apocalypse. Somehow, the less-than-prolific filmmaker manages to surpass that impressive work with this terrifying yet genuinely profound 2013 science-fiction thriller that buzzes by in a fleet 91 minutes. Although Ang Lee effectively used 3-D CGI effects to enhance the magical realism of Life of Pi, I have never seen a film use them as purposefully and powerfully as Cuar√≥n does here within the dramatic structure of the story. Co-written with his son Jon√°s, the screenplay, by contrast, is life-size in its intimacy and even with all the technical jargon, at times poetic. This combination gives the film an almost mythic reach and at the same time, brings insight into the way the human spirit works against the overwhelming emptiness of space. The story takes place about 372 miles above Earth, and the alternately ethereal and scarifying setting is captured in brilliant detail by ace cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and special effects master Tim Webber.Pay particularly close attention to the uninterrupted seventeen-minute sequence that opens the film. It's a bravura piece of cinema by anyone's standards. In brief, bio-medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone is on her first space mission studiously installing a device to fix the Hubble Space Telescope on the U.S Space Shuttle Explorer. Mission commander Matt Kowalski is a veteran astronaut who devilishly spacewalks around her in a jet pack. Mission Control reports that the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites which transforms into a massive attack of hurling debris that arrives in a matter of seconds and will continue to make an orbital return causing massive destruction every ninety minutes. There is no time for the crew to return to the shuttle much less Earth, and the damage to the craft and nearby International Space Station is extensive. It's enough to say that Stone sets off on a journey not only of physical survival but spiritual awakening as her character has been in a listless state since a senseless personal tragedy occurred back home. If you don't count the voiceovers at the beginning, there are only two actors who make up the entire cast, and they are grade-A stars who bring their personal charisma to the fore.George Clooney has the smaller of the two roles as Kowalski, and he uses his natural insouciance to great effect as his wisecracking gives way to a character who provides the knowledgably becalming tone that Stone needs at the story's most critical points. He makes one particularly risky scene work by the sheer magnitude of his character's life-affirming bravado. He also impressively wrote the scene. Even so, this is Sandra Bullock's film from start to finish, and it amazes me how she wasn't even among the top casting choices for the role (Angelina Jolie turned it down twice). Although Stone may come across as emotionally stunted, Bullock offers her natural likeability as a necessary counterbalance. However, that observation short-changes her stellar work here, especially the pure physicality of her performance. Intriguingly, her character is not that far removed from the one she played nearly twenty years earlier in While You Were Sleeping in that both deal with personal losses with an emotional alertness that wins us over completely. Only this time she does it with a graceful maturity that deepens the catharsis of the incredible odyssey she experiences, this in spite of a few overtly sentimental moments thrown in for good measure. Regardless, this is Cuar√≥n's towering cinematic achievement, and the movie truly stands on its own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CY4L9Z4RZ57Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIIGM#wasThisHelpful","R2CY4L9Z4RZ57Y","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suppose one should feel grateful that filmmaker Anne Fontaine (Coco Before Chanel) doesn't stoop to montages of crashing waves on the Australian surf to epitomize the ecstasy that two middle-aged women feel when they fall in love with each other's sons in this solemn 2013 melodrama that treats its taboo subject with surprising matter-of-factness. The core of the story lies in the misguided affections between older women and younger men, but the oedipal nature of the relationships give the film a moral subversion that never really titillates. That's because Fontaine and screenwriter Christopher Hampton (Atonement) appear more interested in the characters' inability to let go of one another in an idyllic setting in a remote cove in New South Wales (beautifully lensed by cinematographer Christophe Beaucarne). Based on Doris Lessing's 2003 novella, The Grandmothers, the film centers on lifelong best friends Lil and Roz, beautiful women in their mid-forties and true soulmates who live very close to each other. Lil is a widow, while Roz's husband is a theater director who finds a better opportunity in Sydney fully expecting Roz and son Tom to move with him. Meanwhile, Tom and Lil's son Ian have over the years become best friends who like nothing more than to surf and spend their days lying on a floating pier in the sun, a major symbol of escape in the story.However, late one night, Ian gives Roz a passionate kiss which signals the beginning of their insatiable affair. When Tom finds out about their tryst almost immediately, he seduces Lil in an act of sexual revenge, but it quickly turns into an affair of equal carnality. Because the boys made the first moves, both women do not regret the consummations that occur, and in fact, jointly celebrate the love they have been able to find in their own backyards. They commit to their respective arrangements for quite some time until the inevitable occurs. Younger rivals show up and force Roz and Lil to reassess the long-term feasibility of their relationships. Years elapse, and when they become, in fact, grandmothers to their boys' girls, the unconditional bonding that occurs between the two mothers becomes genuinely intractable, and even when betrayals occur, their loyalty remains uncompromised. Ironically, this is part of the film's pervasive problem. While I wasn't expecting knockdown catfights given the film's reverential tone, I was waiting for scenes of more palpable tension that would have given a sense of jeopardy to their friendship. Fontaine, however, would have none of those melodramatic conventions in her film.From her perspective, the true love story is between the two women, and the males are simply plot devices to give them something to talk about. Despite some awkward dialogue that would likely draw an unintended guffaw in a crowded theater, the performances of the two leading actresses are exceptional. Not looking as shopworn as she tries to convey, the ever-youthful Naomi Watts (The Impossible) portrays Lil with a mix of insecurity and confusion that comes across as quite natural. With a flawless Australian lilt and her model-ready beauty not about to fade into the night, Robin Wright (House of Cards) brings a sexy world-weary √©lan to Roz that makes it easy to see why Ian would fall in love with her. As Ian, Xavier Samuel (Twilight Saga: Eclipse) brings out all the latent angst of his smitten character, while James Frecheville (Animal Kingdom) plays Tom in a flatter, more elliptical manner since his character is the most sketchily drawn of the four. For a movie that relies so heavily on creating a sense of empathy for the two women, I was constantly surprised how little Fontaine drew on either actress' innate ability to build a higher level of emotional resonance in their characters. Perhaps that was the director's intention, but the limitations of her distant approach become all too clear in the melodrama of the last half-hour.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N1TDRTU165EC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0CLHQO#wasThisHelpful","R3N1TDRTU165EC","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a genuine find this obscure 1964 film is. In the midst of Sidney Poitier's breakthrough as a mainstream leading man of the big studios, director Michael Roemer made a groundbreaking independent film that fully captured the black experience at the dawn of the civil rights movement without exploiting the controversial subject or introducing a non-threatening component that would have made the story more palatable for white audiences. The latter was especially the case in Poitier's biggest movies at the time like Lilies of the Field and Guess Who's Coming To Dinner where he played variations on the over-idealized black man, a point made ironic by the fact that the legendary actor turned down the lead role in this film. In a perceptive screenplay co-written by Roemer and Robert M. Young, the protagonist, Duff Anderson, is anything but idealized. He is a laborer who suffers as much from his own self-loathing as he does from the deeply ingrained racism surrounding him.In early 1960's Birmingham, Alabama, Duff is an itinerant worker, a member of a section team for the railroad company. At a church social one evening, he meets Josie Dawson, a well-educated schoolteacher who happens to be the minister's daughter. In spite of her father's disapproval, the two quietly fall in love and get married. They face one hardship after another as he tries to find stable work while dealing with a troubled past which includes an estranged, embittered father whose life he appears to be emulating against his will. Duff also supports a four-year-old son whom he hasn't seen for two years even though he's not certain he's the father. While racism is presented honestly and produces moments of genuine dramatic tension, it never becomes a manipulative device to move the plot forward. Things begin to unravel between Duff and Josie through the course of the story but not with excessive melodramatic flourishes. In fact, the film is so truthfully matter-of-fact in Roemer's documentary-like approach that when Duff has an explosive moment late in the story it feels shocking but utterly real.The performances completely surprised me. Best known as the quiet communications specialist Sergeant Kinchloe on the long-running sitcom Hogan's Heroes, Ivan Dixon brings unerring gravitas to his conflicted character. He doesn't take any short cuts in presenting Duff as a man who makes his own decisions no matter how harsh the consequences. As Josie, jazz great Abbey Lincoln (For Love of Ivy), with her infectious smile, is genuinely affecting as a woman who becomes attracted to Duff because she thought the two of them ""might have something to say to each other."" One wonders in hindsight how powerfully she might have portrayed Billie Holiday if given the chance she was supposed to have before Diana Ross got cast in Lady Sings the Blues. Julius Harris makes his few scenes count as Duff's belligerent father, while Gloria Foster (later the Oracle in The Matrix) etches a vivid impression as a beaten-down woman who remains inexplicably faithful to him. In one of his earliest roles, Yaphet Kotto (Alien) is recognizable as one of Duff's railroad buddies. The well-used Motown soundtrack is a nice surprise as well. This forgotten film is well worth seeking out. Strongly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34NTYD1NVSLI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002JUX42#wasThisHelpful","R34NTYD1NVSLI9","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was naturally curious to see how a nine-year-old could have landed an Oscar nomination as Best Leading Actress, and clearly director Benh Zeitlin found a gifted child in Quvenzhan√© Wallis, who was actually only five during filming. As Hushpuppy, she provides the precocious voice of this fascinating 2012 film that mixes a stream-of-consciousness narrative with elements of magical realism, the combination of which can be both jarring and moving at the same time. Although the story is steeped in the harsh poverty of the coastal parishes of Louisiana, the movie comes across as a fanciful parable because Zeitlin, along with co-writer Lucy Alibar (whose one-act play ""Juicy and Delicious"" provides the basis of the plot), has effectively captured something celebratory about the struggles of a community who subsists on a bayou island cut off by a levee, appropriately dubbed the ""Bathtub"".In sharp contrast to the unconditionally loving spirit shown by her neighbors, Hushpuppy's father Wink is alternately abusive and protective toward her. As it turns out, he is gravely ill and preparing her for life without him. For a novice filmmaker, Zeitlin does a surprisingly dexterous job of melding the fantastical with the realistic, although I have to admit that the periodically stampeding appearance of the long-extinct Aurochs, a primitive and much larger ancestor of today's cattle, comes across as increasingly contrived. There are similarly anomalous passages throughout the film, but what grounds the fantasy is the volatile relationship between Hushpuppy and Wink. Wallis is a captivating presence that packages a unique blend of innocence and fearlessness into a preternaturally wise child.Another non-professional, Dwight Henry, a baker by trade, turns in an unexpectedly powerful performance as Wink, bringing out the desperation of a broken man with little time to sort out his anger and fear. Credit should be given to cinematographer Ben Richardson, who brings a unity of vision in an otherwise chaotic whirl of activity, even if taking Hushpuppy's perspective means the handheld camera brings a wobbly intensity that can get a bit nerve-racking. A versatile talent, Zeitlin also co-wrote the stirring, evocative soundtrack with composer Dan Romer. Despite a handful of flaws, including a nagging similarity to Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life, Zeitlin has made quite a poetic allegory that could have easily missed had he not presented Hushpuppy's world the way she sees it as an adventure marked by a tenuous search for both adventure and purpose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX1QNUQKV6GVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008220ALC#wasThisHelpful","RX1QNUQKV6GVM","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As fine an actor as he is and despite his acumen in vocal mimicry, Anthony Hopkins somehow misses the mark in impersonating the legendary director in this 2012 biopic. Perhaps it's his overly deliberate line readings or the artificiality of the latex prosthetics or the vivid memory I have of the real filmmaker, but some combination of those factors prevented me from fully accepting Hopkins as Hitchcock. That's a shame since Helen Mirren, who plays Hitchcock's wife Alma Reville, which if this story is to be believed, was the master filmmaker's muse and confidant, is quite effective in conveying the stringent manner of her influential character while revealing Alma's aching vulnerability in having to live in her husband's considerable shadow. Loosely based on Stephen Rebello's meticulously researched 1990 book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the screenplay has been adapted by John J. Laughlin (Black Swan) to focus more on the relationship between Hitchcock and Alma rather than the production of Psycho itself.Director Sacha Gervasi takes the same granular approach that Simon Curtis did with My Week With Marilyn and Steven Spielberg did with ""Lincoln"", i.e., focus on a specific time period in the subject's life and let those events speak to what motivated the character throughout his or her life. However, unlike those films, Gervasi doesn't adequately reveal what made the rule-breaking filmmaker a genius in his field. The challenging production of ""Psycho"" is handled superficially, even the shower scene is given a cursory glance with lackadaisical intercutting of other characters showing how anger manifested itself in Hitchcock. There are also imaginary interludes that show him receiving advice from convicted serial killer Ed Gein, the real-life inspiration for Norman Bates, on how to stage the more gruesome scenes. What does receive a lot of attention is Hitchcock's relationship with Alma and how instrumental her sharp editing skills were in distilling the more memorable moments of the film.Her sense of self-worth is shaken enough by Hitchcock's self-absorption that she is easily seduced by the unbridled attention of smarmy screenwriter Whitfield Cook who wants to collaborate with her on his next big-screen project. Meanwhile, casting Janet Leigh in the film unexpectedly brings out the director's tender side as castmate Vera Miles reflects a barely concealed bitterness for having been a Grace Kelly-like Hitchcock prot√©g√© now reduced to a supporting role to complete her contract. Neither Gervasi nor Laughlin can seem to make all these intertwining storylines resonate beyond a reasonable evocation of the period. Beyond Hopkins and Mirren, there are good albeit underdeveloped performances from Scarlett Johansson as Leigh and Jessica Biel as Miles, neither of whom bears much resemblance to their real-life counterparts. James D'Arcy, however, manages to capture Anthony Perkins' callow nervousness in just a few brief minutes of screen time. All in all, it's an interesting piece of film trivia that falls short of its goal of being something more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFFY3Q6VH8HGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARA4SLU#wasThisHelpful","RFFY3Q6VH8HGD","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for a well-designed and constructed compact dust pan, this should satisfy your need. It comes with a brush that snaps into the handle of the pan for storage, a smart enhancement that makes its size ideal for quickly addressing small messes. The pan also has a flexible but firm rubber edge in order to maximize contact for efficient sweeping., even for very fine dust you wouldn't expect it to pick up. I like the downward angle of the brush since it doesn't tax my wrist as much as a straight edge would have.The brush bristles can be cleaned by rubbing it against the teeth molded into each side of the pan, although it doesn't quite do the job intended. The small size is perfect for those with minimal storage space or if you happen to need something portable for your car. It fits nicely into the side door pocket or in larger glove compartments. In the end, it won't replace your full-size dustpan just as a hand vacuum would never replace a floor model, but it most certainly handles small spills in a pinch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ON8OTNRDXYVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00940DUEK#wasThisHelpful","R2ON8OTNRDXYVY","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now in its 12th season, the PBS staple ""America's Test Kitchen"" hosted by the avuncular if somewhat prickly Christopher Kimball, founder of Cook's Illustrated magazine, introduced a science-class aesthetic to recipes and cooking techniques that have been proven successful through trial and error. Their comprehensive ring-bound cooking manuals (The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook and at least three follow-up variations) have effectively reflected that approach in a print format, and now this hardbound, 344-page book takes it a step further by providing appetizing photographs and a glossy finish. The focus this time is on organizing the foolproof dinner party for eight to twelve people by preparing dishes ahead of time in order for you to be more present with your guests as they arrive. The editors have pulled together 51 different menus - ten for each season plus eleven holiday celebrations - all with well-coordinated themes that should satisfy a variety of palates.Before the book gets into the detail of the menus, it starts with an excellent introductory section that describes what a well-stocked kitchen should have from multi-purpose appliances to simple utensils, provides quick tips ranging from sharpening knives to washing raspberries, and shares time-saving tricks to help you serve your guests efficiently and while cleaning up your cooking messes along the way. There's even a troubleshooting guide to deal with emergencies like what to do when your pan catches on fire or if your roast is still too pink on the inside. I particularly appreciate the three pages devoted to 11th Hour Recipes when circumstances beyond your control force you to get creative at the last minute with appetizers, sides, salad dressings and desserts. Starting on page 19, the seasonal menus begin with Spring. The Rustic Pork Stew Dinner on page 37 was a success for me with rosemary & garlic white bean dip as an appetizer; pork stew with fennel, leeks & prunes as the main course; buttered egg noodles and roasted beet and carrot salad as the sides, and a French silk chocolate pie for dessert.The Summer section contains great ethnic menus with the Mediterranean Flank Steak Supper (page 107) and the Middle East Shish Kebab Dinner (page 125) providing especially savory delights that should please the discriminating foodies among your friends. The Fall menus introduce plenty of comfort food choices that should satisfy appetites heightened by the brisk weather with a terrific Refined Short Ribs Dinner (page 181) and one of my personal favorites, the New York-Style Pizza Party (page 151) which allows you to create four different thin-crust pizzas, including two vegetarian options. Winter brings some really hearty selections including a meaty Steakhouse Prime Rib Dinner (page 233) and a Paella Night (page 245). For the more ambitious, the Celebrations and Holidays section adds even more dishes per menu and covers all the more popular events you are likely to plan as well as a full Thanksgiving feast and an elegant New Year's Eve party. This is a great resource for the host(ess) who wants to leave the best impression possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BM577P24PMJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933615907#wasThisHelpful","R2BM577P24PMJD","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andy Borowitz just tweeted to the masses about a Kindle eBook he wrote earlier this year. He states I can read it fast and it will cheer me up, two things I wasn't necessarily looking for on Christmas morning, but for 99 cents, I bite. Sure enough, it is a quick read (just 18 pages), and it is indeed a life-affirming story and not in a violin-swelling, Lifetime TV-movie kind of way. The cheeky title has to do with how life's unexpected twists force us into situations for which we are never quite prepared. It also has a physical meaning as he details the surgeries he had to go through to fix his twisted colon, three of them and all occurring at ""one of the ten best hospitals in America"".As you would expect from Borowitz, it has plenty of his skewering observational humor filled with the kind of pop-culture remarks that make me smile (""...this is continuous vomiting, uncontrollable, like I've seen a Matthew McConnaughey movie or something."") However, his wry humor doesn't disguise the quickly escalating fear he has about his condition despite being surrounded by his steadfast wife of only nine months, Olivia, and what sounds like a UN delegation of qualified staff. Borowitz has been responsible for several of my funniest retweets, so it's reassuring on Christmas morning to receive his adroit humor gift-wrapped in something so personal and emotionally resonant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PJABTSERGH0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007A4V33M#wasThisHelpful","R3PJABTSERGH0U","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everybody has their own version of the truth, and the way we frame our own stories may have a great deal to do with a higher level of consciousness for which we all strive. Such is the gist of Yann Martel's 2001 bestseller which is the basis of this visually stunning 2012 adventure drama helmed by Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain). I read the book several years ago and remember thinking it would make a great animated film by someone as creative as Hayao Miyazaki (Howl's Moving Castle). CGI, however, has evolved so dramatically in the past decade that the story can be now inhabited by real actors and awash in gorgeous abstraction that melds the fantastical with the intimate quite seamlessly. Shot mostly in a giant tank in Taiwan as well as on location in India, this movie is a unique example of how technology's endless possibilities can well serve an allegorical story focused on human survival and our own individual coping mechanisms.Adapted by David Magee (Finding Neverland), the story is framed by an interview in Montreal between a Canadian writer, a fictionalized version of Martel, and an unassuming middle-aged man named Pi. The first part of the film is a flashback set in a family-run zoo in Pondicherry, a bucolic former French colony in southern India. The central protagonist is Pi as a child whose sternly sensible father runs the zoo. We learn the origins of Pi's unusual name as it relates to an impossibly pristine pool in which his uncle swam in Paris. At once, you get a sense of the importance of both water and mathematics in Pi's early life as well as his unfiltered concept of religion. In Pi's fertile mind, which religion is a moot point as he adopts Hinduism, Christianity and Islam concurrently and despite his family's resistance. A life-endangering confrontation with a Bengal tiger under their care proves to be a turning point for Pi as he is warned by his supportive family to stay away from it. Later economic hardship prompts his father to decide to move to Canada where he plans to sell the animals.The stormy journey by freighter turns tragic around the Mariana Trench where the now-teenaged Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with an unlikely menagerie in tow. The party eventually dwindles down to two, and this is where Lee imbues the film with a surreal spirit befitting the tale as we watch the seemingly incredulous situation of Pi co-existing on the lifeboat with the same tiger we saw in his childhood encounter. Dubbed Richard Parker due to a previous mix-up in paperwork, the tiger is integral to a series of eye-catching episodes that involves flying fish pelting them with force, a plethora of glowing jellyfish at night, a breaching whale nearly capsizing the boat, a disastrous storm that carries them to the brink, and a bizarrely florid island overrun with carnivorous plants and curious meerkats. None of these episodes will surprise readers of the book, but the execution is enthralling thanks to the masterful work of Chilean cinematographer Claudio Miranda (The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button) and the visual effects generated by the Rhythm & Hues Studios.Similarities to Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away and Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat are probably not without intention on Lee's part, but this movie manages to hold its own. My one complaint about the film comes toward the end when things are spelled out a bit too deliberately considering how symbolic the story has been expressed up to that point. Pi is played by four actors depicting the character at different ages. Suraj Sharma effectively portrays Pi during the challenging lifeboat sequence and obviously makes the strongest impression, but Gautam Belur and Ayush Tandon are also affecting in conveying Pi's evolving psyche during his tender childhood years. Irrfan Khan (The Namesake) plays Pi in the present with his becalming demeanor seemingly at odds with the incredulous story he tells Martel. Khan's movie wife from ""The Namesake"", Tabu, shows up as Pi's understanding mother, and G√©rard Depardieu appears inexplicably in a cameo as the freighter ship's nasty cook. Rafe Spall (One Day) plays Martel in a rather nondescript manner. It's not a perfect film, but many of the sumptuous images will likely stick with you for a long while afterward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XS2FWY9RG2MN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIIHG#wasThisHelpful","R2XS2FWY9RG2MN","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By sheer coincidence, I was dining with a friend at the Lion just a couple of weeks ago. It was only later that I realized this upscale Greenwich Village tavern was once the gay nightclub where a 17-year-old Barbra Streisand made her singing debut at a talent contest in 1960. This life-changing episode is described in fond detail by biographer William Mann, who has already written comprehensive books about the lives and careers of Katharine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor. This time, he decided to focus on just four formative years of Streisand's life from 1960 when she was an aspiring actress to 1964 when she became the toast of Broadway starring in Funny Girl. For Streisand fans like myself, there is nothing really new in terms of the career milestones being shared, but his novelized approach to her early life fills in some blanks that have at least some credibility due to his exhaustive research.Having just seen Streisand in concert at 70 last month, I am still awestruck at the endurance of this woman's mellifluous voice and performing prowess. Yet, singing was only her back-up plan after she failed to pass auditions as an actress. Aided by fledging actor Barry Dennen, who became her lover for a time, she created an act of cabaret standards and comic banter and was an immediate hit on the nightclub circuit and eventually in appearances on TV, including her legendary duets with Judy Garland. However, Broadway producers like David Merrick were alienated by her unusual looks, and she almost wasn't cast in her breakthrough role of put-upon secretary Miss Marmelstein in I Can Get It For You Wholesale. She stole the show and seemed like a shoo-in for the lead as Ziegfeld Follies star Fanny Brice in ""Funny Girl"", a story not that dissimilar to her own as it traces the story of a talented ugly duckling who bloomed as a popular performer in the spotlight. Still, lyricist Bob Merrill thought her too plain in the role.When producer Ray Stark finally recognized her gigantic talent, she got the role, and the rest is show business legend. In between, she met and married Elliott Gould, who was then a Broadway actor making a name for himself but inevitably scorched by her meteoric rise. Mann is obviously quite a fan, as his prose borders on effusive and sometimes embarrassing in his praise of her work. At the same time, he doesn't shy away from describing how her success made her more mistrustful of people, even a few key early supporters like Dennen who were instrumental in shaping her persona, and how her constant striving for perfectionism grew unabated. Although she has said in recent interviews that she is slowly letting go of those lofty standards, Mann would have you believe she is far removed from the spontaneous, vibrantly alive creature she was back then. His book effectively conveys how even a legend as exalted as Streisand has to steadfastly maintain a veneer of cautiousness to live up to the expectations she set up for herself during those early years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z6DXIB6DPQB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547368925#wasThisHelpful","R1Z6DXIB6DPQB3","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing this serious-minded 2012 romantic comedy does is prove that Rashida Jones (Parks & Recreation, The Social Network) can carry a film. Like Debra Winger and Holly Hunter before her, she's one of those actresses who comes across as a little too smart for the room but still elicits affection when she allows herself to reveal her vulnerability. This must also be the way she sees herself since she co-wrote the screenplay with featured player Will McCormack (the stoner pal of Andy Samberg's character) and is in almost every scene of this movie. Fortunately it doesn't come across as a self-serving act of megalomania despite the character she plays. She's a type-A career woman, a celebrity trend-spotter who compulsively controls all her impulses, while Samberg plays a slacker graphic artist who's fine with not working for long stretches and repeatedly watches videos of the weightlifting competition from the 2008 Beijing Olympics for inspiration.Directed with a surprisingly deft hand by Lee Toland Krieger (The Vicious Kind), the movie focuses on how these two characters, married but separated, remain an absurdly compatible couple whose failed attempt at marriage initially seems quite dumbfounding. They both contend they can divorce but remain best friends, an assertion that appalls best friends Beth and Tucker who are about to get married and can't understand why they won't move on with their lives. That's the simple premise, and the rest of the story deals with what happens when one starts to get serious about someone else and how neither is prepared for what it will do to their relationship. Their stop-start confusion is palpably played out amid a cool but lived-in LA that feels like an appropriate setting for this familiar story. Jones has Celeste carry most of the emotional burden, and she lends genuine likability to a character that could have otherwise been downright insufferable, which is a constant source of humor in the clever script.Samberg is good in his first serious role although he sometimes seems too recessive to counterbalance Jones' energetic presence. Emma Roberts (Julia's niece, Valentine's Day) plays Celeste's petulant Lady Gaga-wannabe pop star client Riley Banks with fervor and brings a nice edge to her scenes with Jones, while Elijah Wood has coiled fun playing Celeste's uptight gay business partner. Ari Graynor (Conviction) and Eric Christian Olsen effectively play Beth and Tucker to their accustomed stereotypes. Chris Messina shows up yet again in a prominent supporting role, this time as Celeste's acerbic patient suitor in waiting. There are moments, scenes even, where I felt the movie was a little too satisfied with itself, but it usually recovers with amusing twists on conventional romcom situations mostly involving Celeste's inability to accept the inevitable. That, of course, places the pressure on Jones to deliver the goods as both star and screenwriter, both of which she handles quite well here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7V7MRWWNUPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADRYCWC#wasThisHelpful","R7V7MRWWNUPJ","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ben Affleck the actor has never impressed me much, a journeyman who has made some real stinkers (Gigli, Surviving Christmas), but Ben Affleck the filmmaker has really come into his own. His third film as a director (Gone Baby Gone, The Town) is a first-rate political thriller with a pulpish fervor and keen intelligence. The Iran hostage crisis of 1979-81 takes on revitalized life in this engrossing 2012 movie with great period detail and a well-turned screenplay by first-timer Chris Terrio. The recent Benghazi killings only makes this story resonate more with an event hidden from history prior to 1997 propulsively dramatized here as a turning point in the precarious state of U.S. relations with the entire Arab world. It's fascinating to consider the truth behind the ""best bad idea"" the CIA could concoct to rescue six U.S. embassy workers who managed to escape the compound. There's a blessedly brief prologue chronicling the events that led to the Shah's exile to the U.S. and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini and fundamentalist Islam in Iran leading to the tense hostage situation.The six workers found refuge at the Canadian embassy. With the CIA at a loss to figure out how to sneak them out of Iran, exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez is inspired a bit of Battle For The Planet Of The Apes to come up with an incredulous plot to have the six pose as a Canadian film crew who were flown to Teheran to scout locations for a phony sci-fi film that gives this movie its name. Mendez enlists prosthetics expert, real-life makeup artist John Chambers, to help convince veteran producer Lester Siegel to get studio backing for the fake epic. Siegel insists the picture look credible, so he buys an existing script, holds a reading with real actors at the Beverly Hilton, and starts an advertising campaign in the trade papers. All the gears are set in motion as Mendez's boss Jack O'Donnell miraculously gains approval for the far-fetched plan. Mendez flies to Teheran with doctored passports in hand and tries to convince the six to act out their roles with precise detail before they get recognized by Iranian officials as escapees from the embassy.This race against the clock provides the tension in the film's final act, which comes down to a rather implausible albeit extremely thrilling chase scene at the airport. With Affleck in mostly stoic mode as Mendez, the cast is solidly effective with three unsurprising standouts - John Goodman as the avuncular Chambers, Bryan Cranston as the acerbic O'Donnell, and Alan Arkin who steals all his scenes with ease as Siegel. All the period detail is excellent from the tacky clothes to the Turkish locations standing in for Iran. The slightly washed-out documentary-style of Rodrigo Prieto's (Brokeback Mountain) cinematography perfectly captures the crowded, often squalid atmosphere. There's also an evocative use of vintage TV news clips featuring Mike Wallace's infamous interview with Khomeini. The final explanation of how the real story of the mission unfolded is provided in a voice-over by Jimmy Carter, who was President when it all took place up until the rest of the hostages were released. The film is a genre picture at heart but a historically evocative and emotionally powerful one thanks to Affleck's impressive work behind the camera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BCX4JXHIXVHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005S9ELM6#wasThisHelpful","R1BCX4JXHIXVHL","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Especially well targeted to those in space-constrained situations, this is a smartly designed drying rack that suits anyone who doesn't want to use their dryer excessively. It has a broad wingspan that fits forty feet of drying space and folds up nicely when you're done. The racks at the end of each wing accommodate hangers, and accessories include hanging space for socks and a soft drying cloth that stretches over the flat middle section.

"There are few singers who can release tracks recorded over a span of 44 years and make the sum appear so seamless and intentional, and yet that's what makes Barbra Streisand unique among pop vocalists. To call her a legend would be clich√© at this point. She has dabbled in all sorts of musical genres over the course of her storied career, and this wonderful disc of previously unreleased tracks proves she was willing to take chances while remaining true to her mellifluent tonal quality and innate dramatic sense. I have listened to snatches of some of these songs over the years usually through some resourceful superfan who would post them on YouTube over montages of age-appropriate images. However, Streisand takes full charge of what comes out of her own vault this time, and there are a number of gems to be discovered and in a few cases, re-discovered.The disc opens with a pristine outtake from 1985's The Broadway Album, the dramatically escalating ""Being Good Isn't Good Enough"" from the failed civil rights musical, ""Hallelujah, Baby!"", by Jule Styne, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. The bombastic orchestral arrangement suits her theatrical instincts quite well. This track was jettisoned for Stephen Sondheim's more satirically pointed ""Putting It Together"" as the opener to ""The Broadway Album"". Jimmy Webb's ""Didn't We"" has been part of Streisand's canon for years, but surprisingly, a studio recording has never made it to an album before this. While I like the clean 1970 version presented, it lacks the stylistic touches found in her performance of this song on the unaired ""David Frost Show"" that has been floating on YouTube for years or even the more ragged version on the Live Concert at the Forum album.From the 1967 Simply Streisand sessions, ""Willow Weep for Me"" is the earliest recording included here, and it shows her youthful virtuosic approach working well within the jazzy-blue Ray Ellis arrangement of this Billie Holliday standard. Recorded for 1977's Superman as she was learning to play the guitar, Larry Gatlin's ""Try to Win a Friend"" is one of her rare forays into country, and it's a nice if anomalous ballad which she sings with twangy sincerity. Taken from the 1970 Stoney End sessions, her simple rendition of Randy Newman's ""I Think It's Going to Rain Today"", accompanied only by his piano, is similar to the cut that did make the album (""I'll Be Home""), but I love the haunting chord changes and elliptical images that evoke the melancholy of the heavy outreach message conveyed. It's truly the most timeless cut on the disc.The studio recording of ""With One More Look at You"" is a surprise with a full orchestra, soulful back-up singers and its loping mid-seventies arrangement. I don't think it's an improvement over the version that made the soundtrack album, but without the context of the movie, it somehow works as a piece of period pop music. Bossa nova legend Antonio Carlos Jobim's ""Antigua"" turned into quite a trippy song called ""Lost in Wonderland"" courtesy of the intricately confusing lyrics by Marshall Barer. Amazingly, she recorded this performance in one take in 1968 and captures the ""Ipanema"" sway effortlessly along the way. Recorded for an aborted Back To Broadway album in 1988, the concept of which was resuscitated a few years later, the seamless medley of ""How Are Things in Glocca Morra?"" from ""Finian's Rainbow"" and ""Heather on the Hill"" from ""Brigadoon"" has been a staple for years on YouTube.The shimmering beauty of her performance remains unabated with a lovely introductory section I never heard before. The Bergmans are represented twice here, first with 1973's ""Mother and Child"" from an abandoned album project they were working on with Michel Legrand. It's an epic lullaby that turns into a highly theatrical duet with Streisand playing both parts quite effusively. The second is an outtake from last year's tribute album, What Matters Most - Barbra Streisand Sings The Lyrics of Alan And Marilyn Bergman, the melancholic ""If It's Meant to Be"" in which Streisand's burnished tones provide an affecting denouement to the disc. The last song chosen, however, is a driving, ABBA-esque cover of ""Home"" from ""The Wiz"" recorded during ""The Broadway Album"" sessions. It may lack the innocent yearning of previous versions, but Streisand doesn't pretend to be a Kansas girl. She makes the song a declarative statement of her recording career. Yes, this one is a must for fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PU3UZEU6G5TP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00914JWSW#wasThisHelpful","R3PU3UZEU6G5TP","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy, I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago, Ulu Grosbard's Falling in Love (1984), in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect (Robert De Niro) on a commuter train. I kept thinking of Kay as that earlier character all these years later trying to fan the embers of the passion that erupted so unpredictably back then. Interestingly, her younger character could not consummate the affair either but fell hopelessly in love anyway. Director David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada) and first-time screenwriter Vanessa Taylor travel to the opposite end of the marital spectrum, a 31-year-old marriage that finds Kay and her accountant husband Arnold sleeping in separate bedrooms having long ago lost any sense of intimacy and passion their marriage once had. The film begins with a seriocomic preface in which Kay awkwardly tries to seduce Arnold, an invitation he rebuffs with the flimsiest of excuses. Knowing their marriage is on auto-pilot, she fears being alone emotionally and ending their lives in emotional isolation now as they go through the motions in their sixties.An optimist despite the odds, Kay signs them up for a week of intensive couples therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine, where renowned therapist Dr. Bernie Feld practices. Arnold is predictably resistant but begrudgingly accompanies her when he realizes how serious Kay is about the counseling. The sessions with Dr. Feld initially don't go well with Arnold protesting the doctor's every recommendation for building intimacy in his relationship with Kay. This is when the movie becomes the most surprising because every time a physically awkward moment presents itself, the feelings become heartfelt and sometimes humorous in unexpected ways. While Frankel and Taylor handle the slim story turns with genuine insight, it's the masterful work of Streep and Tommy Lee Jones that elevates the film into an experience that far transcends the Lifetime-TV orientation you would expect otherwise. Unafraid to come across as harshly judgmental, Jones has made a career of playing dyspeptic curmudgeons, so it's nice to see him gradually reveal Arnold's vulnerabilities with skill and delicacy. He has to play Arnold close to the vest but not so insular as to make you wonder what Kay saw in him in the first place. After tackling larger-than-life figures like Julia Child and Margaret Thatcher, Streep is splendid portraying a sheltered woman who contributes as much to the fossilized, inchoate marriage as Arnold does.At 63, the actress allows herself to look even beyond her age, but she's still beautiful in a shopworn way. I love how she almost swallows every word she speaks as if Kay's tentative nature is holding back grand expectations of a romance she can only fantasize about. The two veteran actors have a natural rapport that gives the viewer a rooting interest in seeing them overcome their age-old emotional and physical barriers. There are moments between them especially in the film's last third that are quite heartbreaking, especially when they come to learn that they aren't the people they believed themselves, or each other, to be. Steve Carell plays Feld straight-up without an iota of irony, and his clinical approach works effectively within this context.

"A studio picture with a premise this contrived shouldn't work, but this 2012 family drama works in ways that are quite unexpected and emotionally resonant because a palpable level of truthfulness emerges with the characters even as the plot teeters precariously on credibility issues. First-time filmmaker Alex Kurtzman, a go-to screenwriter of uber-action fare like Star Trek and Mission: Impossible III, based his personal movie on events in his own life when he met his own half-sister for the first time as he turned thirty. The plot focuses on Sam, a slick, 31-year-old huckster of a salesman in the bartering business. Just as he gets snagged by a bad deal that costs him the huge bonus he just secured to pay off long-standing debts, Sam finds out his father, Jerry Harper, a legendary Laurel Canyon record producer, has died, which means he needs to come home to LA for the funeral against his will. Reuniting with his estranged mother Lillian becomes challenging enough, but Sam also discovers that his father left him $150,000 in his shaving kit.The catch is that it comes with instructions to deliver the cash to an 11-year-old named Josh, who happens to be the son of Frankie, a half-sister he didn't know he had. Tempted to keep the cash himself, Sam finds Frankie and follows her to an AA meeting where she shares the sudden news of her father's death and the hurtful anger she feels for not being publicly acknowledged as his daughter. Her pain is what becomes the common bond that she and Sam share and the beginning of a web of lies he tells her in order to build upon his newly discovered family ties. It's this thread of deception that propels Kurtzman's storyline, and the moment you start to feel the movie get phony, he manages to get it back on track through the burgeoning relationship that forms between Sam, Frankie and Josh. Of course, the further Sam delays in telling the truth, the more catastrophic the results. Perceptive performances are critical in pulling off this kind of drama, and Kurtzman coaxes strong work from his cast.Chris Pine captures Sam's manic energy and evasive nature to a T, and he manages to reveal the vulnerability underneath that shows he never quite gave up on his quest for his father's approval and love. Still etched in my memory as the hot-to-trot bookstore clerk in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Elizabeth Banks has matured as an actress and delivers a genuinely empathetic performance as Frankie, a single mother struggling with a hardscrabble life and a smart, troublemaking son. She and Pine manage a nice rapport that skirts the incest minefield that could have occurred in lesser hands. Too long off the screen and still looking like People Magazine's most beautiful woman, Michelle Pfeiffer makes her few scenes count as the newly widowed Lillian, who met Jerry back in the seventies when she was a former hatcheck girl at the Troubadour and dreamed of becoming the next Joni Mitchell. She succinctly shares her anger toward Sam for his indifference toward Jerry while slowly revealing her own secrets and fears. As the precocious Josh, Michael Hall D'Addario is given lines only an 11-year-old in a mainstream movie would speak, but he is such a likeable young actor that he manages to come across as authentic.Olivia Wilde has a thankless role as Sam's put-upon girlfriend Hannah, but she provides more depth than the plot device she represents, while indie mainstay Mark Duplass (Humpday) seems to be showing up everywhere these days, this time as Frankie's conveniently available downstairs neighbor. There are cameos from familiar character actor Philip Baker Hall (50/50) as Jerry's attorney friend and Jon Favreau as Sam's belligerent boss. A.R. Rahman (Slumdog Millionaire) provides the original music, while cinematographer Salvatore Totino (The Da Vinci Code) really captures the vibrancy of LA life beyond the stereotypical images. Kurtzman sometimes abuses quick cuts to emphasize Sam's restlessness, but when the truth is revealed in the story, it reinforces the message he sincerely conveys in appreciating the value of family and the importance of forgiveness. His clever use of home movies to bring this message home results in the heartbreaking impact that was obviously intended. I definitely recommend this surprising movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QZ1GOQOGAQEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J691HU#wasThisHelpful","R1QZ1GOQOGAQEK","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to give Jennifer Garner credit for playing a despicable character in sheep's clothing with such unfettered brio in this 2012 comedy, one that aspires to be a darkly eccentric political satire but ultimately becomes too soft-centered for its own good. That outcome is a real shame since the stellar cast is obviously quite game for something edgier, the women in particular, and the scabrous tone works well for at least the first half of the movie. Director Jim Field Smith and first-time writer Jason Micallef certainly make their political proclivities clear with their broad caricature of corn-belt values and status-hungry elitists who intend on attaining power any way they can. With her constantly pinched voice, crisp color-coordinated outfits, perfect hair and make-up and a triple strand of pearls strung tightly around her neck, Garner is obviously playing Laura Pickler as an amalgam of Sarah Palin and Michelle Bachman but with a more naked malevolence toward anyone who stands in her way toward the White House.Even though her congenial husband Bob, the Iowa State Fair's 15-time butter sculpting champion, is asked by the judges to bow out of the latest competition, Laura is not about to relinquish her powerful position as queen of the fair and decides to enter the contest herself. However, she faces unexpected competition from a ten-year-old African-American child named Destiny, who has been moving from one foster home to another with her packed suitcase in tow. She somehow maintains a level head about her life as she tries to figure out what her true talent is. The answer lies in butter. For most of the first hour, the film provides a lot of easy laughs at the expense of Middle America conservatism and Tea Party stereotypes. It was clever to cast Ty Burrell since he plays Bob as a slightly duller variation on his classic portrayal of dimly lit Phil on Modern Family, but he's quickly relegated to the sidelines here. The first butter sculpting contest is set up quite amusingly with the addition of two other contestants: Carol-Ann, a devoted fan girl of Bob's played with ditzy dexterity by Kristen Schaal (30 Rock), and a vengeful, hard-edged stripper named Brooke, who is waiting for a $600 payment from Bob for services rendered.As an unsavory character who wants desperately to annihilate Laura's dreams of higher status, Olivia Wilde is a genuine comic revelation who almost steals the entire movie as Brooke. Having just seen her as the overly patient, put-upon girlfriend in People Like Us, I am surprised at how bracingly funny she is here in her 180-degree turn as a foul-mouthed nihilist trying to look tough riding on a girl's bicycle. Playing what has to be considered the too-good-to-be-true Obama figure, Yara Shahidi brings quiet depth to Destiny and makes her feeling of isolation palpable even as her foster parents show their unconditional love for her. As the liberal-minded couple who take her into their home, Rob Corddry (Seeking a Friend for the End of the World) tamps down his antic comic style just enough to resonate, while Alicia Silverstone (Clueless) makes a welcome return as the one likeable grown woman in the story. Although the movie has a sharper edge than ""The Campaign"", Micallef's screenplay reaches a certain point where you begin to realize that there is little to Laura's motivations beyond her small-minded ambition.It's at this juncture in the story that Hugh Jackman shows up as her former flame Boyd Bolton, a successful car dealer who still holds a torch for Laura and colludes with her to ensure her victory at the fair. In only a few scenes, Jackman hams it up considerably, especially in a silly prayer scene. Phyllis Smith (Bad Teacher), on the other hand, has a few sharply funny moments as the continually flummoxed contest moderator. The final showdown feels rather repetitive with little variety in the build-up of suspense and a denouement that feels far too predictable and contrived to make the story's resolution feel like it was earned. Nevertheless, the central concept of butter sculpture as the means of driving the absurdist plot somehow works. Seeing all the blocks of yellow lard turn into hilariously inappropriate creations like Schindler's List, T-Rex Eating Girl, The Last Supper, and even JFK's assassination provides the film's biggest laughs. At the same time, in a dilemma that it shares with ""The Campaign"", I just wish the filmmakers maintained their initial audacity all the way through instead of slapping on an ending that lets the story sputter out insipidly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SCCE7FYB1IB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00978SIJ6#wasThisHelpful","R3SCCE7FYB1IB8","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Casting Jack Black in the title role of this 2012 dark comedy turns out to be a masterstroke on the part of director and co-screenwriter Richard Linklater because the real-life character of Bernie Tiede is a comically ambiguous figure not only sexually but more to the point, as a jovial child-man personality beloved by his small Texas town of Carthage while at the same time, strangely insistent in his constant presence in their lives. His pointed need for universal acceptance and unconditional love is what makes Bernie unique as a screen creation. It takes Black's oddly discomfiting screen persona to make the character work as a protagonist of closeted complexity, and in turn, he delivers his most accomplished screen work to date. No stranger to Texas-size guffaws intermingled with wry observations about human nature, the versatile Linklater (Before Sunrise/Before Sunset) tells this hard-to-believe, true-crime story with both morbid humor and surprising conviction.Based on a comic 1998 Texas Monthly article by co-screenwriter Skip Hollandsworth, the plot revolves around the unlikely relationship between Bernie, a relentlessly thoughtful assistant funeral director, and Marjorie Nugent, recently widowed and one of the richest women in Carthage. As Bernie becomes indispensable to the fabric of the community with his acts of charitable kindness, his Broadway-style choir solos, and his gentlemanly way of comforting widows in the throes of their grief, the ever-scowling Marjorie is always ready for battle with not only the townsfolk who impede on her life but even her immediate family who can't stand her. Bernie, however, is able to breakthrough her icy veneer with his cheery persistence, and their relationship evolves into an unhealthy codependence to put it mildly. As Marjorie lavishes Bernie with expensive gifts and luxurious vacations, she grows increasingly manipulative in her need to control his every move to meet her every need.Even Bernie has his limits about what he is willing to do under her iron fist, and needless to say, consequences ensue. For all the dire consequences, Linklater keeps the mood buoyant with the insertion of intertitles to signal what question the movie will address next and with the brief interviews he includes with both actors and true residents of Carthage, all showing their unqualified support of Bernie through his burgeoning troubles. Much like Warren Beatty did in Reds, Linklater uses them as a cumulative Greek chorus who on one hand, provide some of the film's biggest laughs, and on the other, illustrate just how myopic and oppressive a small town can be in its rumor mongering ways, so much so that Bernie's trial has to be moved fifty miles away in order to allow the light of objectivity to filter into the proceedings. As Bernie, Black finally has a multi-dimensional role that fits him perfectly, and I would be hard pressed to identify anyone else who could have played the character to the seriocomic depths he achieves here.Well into her seventh decade of movie stardom, Shirley MacLaine is not particularly challenged in portraying Marjorie's sourpuss nature since she's been playing variations on the same role since her turn as the ornery Ouisa in Steel Magnolias"". However, in one key scene, she lets loose all her insecurities that exposes the impenetrable cage in which she has put the increasingly desperate Bernie. Linklater favorite Matthew McConnaughey (Dazed and Confused) plays the showboating district attorney Danny Buck with gusto, although I wish he was reined in a bit more to provide more of a contrast to the other two principal actors. The movie is a fascinating meld of the Coen Brothers' Fargo and Hal Ashby's Harold and Maude with an unexpected dose of Christopher Guest's mockumentaries. While Linklater does not completely avoid making Carthage the object of ridicule, he has made a black comedy with surprising resonance when all is said and done, especially when you see the real Tiede in an archival video clip at the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJHI00JKDL76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00891ZD6I#wasThisHelpful","R1JJHI00JKDL76","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It does seem a shame to cast three generations of compelling actresses as a dysfunctional family and then let them drown in a sea of tired character clich√©s and pop psychology babble. But that's exactly what happens in director Bruce Beresford's 2012 dramedy, a touchy-feely, throwaway vehicle for Jane Fonda, Catherine Keener, and Elizabeth Olsen (Martha Marcy May Marlene), who all try hard to rise above the broad brushstrokes that mark the superficial script by first-time screenwriters Joseph Muszynski and Christina Mengert. There isn't a single surprise that would make anyone reconsider the trite nature of the cross-generational conflict on display here, and Beresford doesn't help matters by the film's odd pacing where the basic set-up is presented in the first three minutes at which point the principal characters go through the most formulaic transformations in an expeditious manner similar in depth to a Lifetime TV-movie.The story begins as Diane, an uptight Manhattan lawyer, is suddenly informed by her husband that he wants a divorce. Instead of discussing the matter, she packs up her two teenaged children - self-righteous vegan daughter Zoe and aspiring filmmaker son Jake - and visits her mother Grace up in Woodstock even though they haven't spoken in twenty years. Of course, Grace is Diane's exact opposite, a free spirit hippie artist, a political rabble-rouser and a successful pot dealer, so naturally conflict ensues immediately. While the perennially glum Diane glares judgmentally at Grace, both Diane and Zoe, of course, find love with local men who are their polar opposites - Diane with a laid-back carpenter and singer named Jude, Zoe with a sensitive butcher named Cole. In the meantime, Jake annoyingly videotapes life in Woodstock while crushing on a girl who works in a local coffee shop.All the while, grandma Grace espouses spiritually uplifting bromides to everyone about how they need to live their lives to the fullest much like a self-help motivational speaker promoting her latest book. Regardless, it's a pleasure to see the 74-year-old Fonda look fit and loose-limbed as Grace even though I was getting the nagging sense she should be doing a lot more than play this dotty caricature. Playing against type, Keener seems particularly one-note as the mostly dour Diane, and some of her natural looseness as an actress would have helped bring more dimension to the role. Current indie ""it girl"" Olsen shows welcome moments of vulnerability that are severely blunted by Zoe's generally insufferable nature. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (P.S. I Love You) appears to be specializing in idealized rebound love interests, and he plays the emotionally accessible Jude with roguish easy charm.Chace Crawford (Gossip Girl) seems to be playing a younger version of the same male stereotype as Cole inexplicably entranced by Zoe. Nat Wolff (The Naked Brothers Band) provides mostly comic relief as hopelessly naÔve Jake. I'm not sure why Rosanna Arquette is in the film since she's given next to nothing to do. The cinematography by Andre Fleuren nicely captures the bucolic landscape of upstate New York, but I found the original music by Spencer David Hutchings more intrusive than evocative. For his part, Beresford looks to be resuscitating key moments from Fonda's own film of parental alienation, On Golden Pond, but a better story model would have been Lisa Cholodenko's The Kids Are All Right which lent layers of emotional complexity to a family unit challenged by a lack of forgiveness. After all, outside of this formulaic film, life just isn't as groovy as Grace would have you believe.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TSH0UGYNI13P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008GFI3EG#wasThisHelpful","R2TSH0UGYNI13P","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If not for the hilarious turns from stars Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis, this raucous 2012 comedy would be another toothless satire about our current political system. There is something fierce about the fearlessness in their play-acting that makes you wish the screenplay by Chris Henchy and Shawn Harwell had gone for the jugular a lot more than it does under Jay Roach's (Meet the Parents) pedestrian direction. Ironically, Roach directed two sharp-eyed HBO films, the recent Sarah Palin-skewering pageant Game Change and the Bush-Gore hanging chad saga Recount, both of which clearly brought forth the Machiavellian nature of the electoral process within the context of actual political history. Without real-life events to guide him, Roach retreats into a big-screen version of a Saturday Night Live-style sketch comedy with plenty of sight gags but frankly not enough jabs at the current bewildering state of political advertising.Ferrell plays Cam Brady, a four-term congressman from North Carolina's fictional 14th district, who runs unopposed until a crude phone message he left for his mistress gets broadcast to the media. This act motivates the powerful Motch brothers, who are driven to build an economic dynasty in the district, to find the only candidate they could find at the last minute, Marty Huggins, a small-town travel agent who happens to be the unintended scion of a longtime political family in the state. Initially inept as a politician, Huggins gets groomed by campaign manager Tim Wattley to reshape Huggins' life completely. The movie then becomes a series of one-upmanship between Huggins and Brady that escalates into backstabbing tawdriness. These scenes are particularly hilarious, for instance, Brady's butchering of ""The Lord's Prayer"" during the first debate, Huggins being connected in Brady's commercials to Saddam Hussein just because of his moustache (shades of Trump's birthing campaign), and Brady's baby-punching gaffe (repeated over and over again in faux-news coverage).My favorite scene is a throwaway montage where the Huggins family takes a break and reverts to their Twinkie-swilling, pug-caressing ways for one evening. As funny as these episodes are, I was hoping there would be a sharper political edge to the comedy. It all feels a few steps behind the surreal realities of the current presidential campaign, meaning provocative parody appears intentionally bypassed for a risk-free gag-fest, one that doesn't linger that long in the memory. Ferrell and Galifianakis easily deliver all the expected laughs as Brady and Huggins, although when the film gives off a whiff of pathos (e.g., Brady's meltdown in the office), the film simply feels off. Dylan McDermott is effectively slimy as Wattley, while Dan Ackroyd and John Lithgow have a good time playing the erudite Motch brothers (recalling the Duke brothers from Ackroyd's 1983 comedy with Eddie Murphy, Trading Places). Personally, I got tired of Karen Maruyama's running gag as a maid faking a Deep South accent, but Katherine LaNasa and Sarah Baker were quite good as the campaign wives. Undemanding viewing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAWYYHVT7VQQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008220BGQ#wasThisHelpful","RAWYYHVT7VQQW","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy, I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago, Ulu Grosbard's Falling in Love (1984), in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect (Robert De Niro) on a commuter train. I kept thinking of Kay as that earlier character all these years later trying to fan the embers of the passion that erupted so unpredictably back then. Interestingly, her younger character could not consummate the affair either but fell hopelessly in love anyway. Director David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada) and first-time screenwriter Vanessa Taylor travel to the opposite end of the marital spectrum, a 31-year-old marriage that finds Kay and her accountant husband Arnold sleeping in separate bedrooms having long ago lost any sense of intimacy and passion their marriage once had. The film begins with a seriocomic preface in which Kay awkwardly tries to seduce Arnold, an invitation he rebuffs with the flimsiest of excuses. Knowing their marriage is on auto-pilot, she fears being alone emotionally and ending their lives in emotional isolation now as they go through the motions in their sixties.An optimist despite the odds, Kay signs them up for a week of intensive couples therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine, where renowned therapist Dr. Bernie Feld practices. Arnold is predictably resistant but begrudgingly accompanies her when he realizes how serious Kay is about the counseling. The sessions with Dr. Feld initially don't go well with Arnold protesting the doctor's every recommendation for building intimacy in his relationship with Kay. This is when the movie becomes the most surprising because every time a physically awkward moment presents itself, the feelings become heartfelt and sometimes humorous in unexpected ways. While Frankel and Taylor handle the slim story turns with genuine insight, it's the masterful work of Streep and Tommy Lee Jones that elevates the film into an experience that far transcends the Lifetime-TV orientation you would expect otherwise. Unafraid to come across as harshly judgmental, Jones has made a career of playing dyspeptic curmudgeons, so it's nice to see him gradually reveal Arnold's vulnerabilities with skill and delicacy. He has to play Arnold close to the vest but not so insular as to make you wonder what Kay saw in him in the first place. After tackling larger-than-life figures like Julia Child and Margaret Thatcher, Streep is splendid portraying a sheltered woman who contributes as much to the fossilized, inchoate marriage as Arnold does.At 63, the actress allows herself to look even beyond her age, but she's still beautiful in a shopworn way. I love how she almost swallows every word she speaks as if Kay's tentative nature is holding back grand expectations of a romance she can only fantasize about. The two veteran actors have a natural rapport that gives the viewer a rooting interest in seeing them overcome their age-old emotional and physical barriers. There are moments between them especially in the film's last third that are quite heartbreaking, especially when they come to learn that they aren't the people they believed themselves, or each other, to be. Steve Carell plays Feld straight-up without an iota of irony, and his clinical approach works effectively within this context. The rest of the supporting cast makes very little impact, including Jean Smart as Kay's sassy manager at the Coldwater Creek she works part-time, Elisabeth Shue as an equally sassy barmaid counseling Kay on sex, and Mimi Rogers as the final payoff of a joke about a comely (and yes, sassy) neighbor with a trio of corgis. The young actors who play Kay and Arnold's adult children are barely present, but I'm sure that was part of the intention in order to allow complete focus on the couple.

"What a mess. First-time feature director and screenwriter Leslye Headland goes for the jugular in this 2012 black comedy which takes the same cues as 2011's megahit Bridesmaids does but frankly doesn't take them far enough to be remotely funny. In fact, I laughed only once during the film's 91-minute running time (it was the line about Michael Jackson). That's too bad because producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay were able to recruit a first-class cast and then unfortunately lets Headland flounder with a predictably belabored situation, leaden pacing, and gags that are overly deliberate in execution. The threadbare plot focuses on a dysfunctional trio of obnoxious girlfriends who gather together √† la The Hangover for a hedonistic night of celebration before their friend's big wedding. The bride-to-be is Becky, a former geek whom the trio viciously called ""Pig Face"" in high school behind her back. Now hitting thirty and finding their lives disappointing to say the least, the girlfriends are horrified to be beaten to the altar by someone they treated as a mascot to make themselves feel better.The alpha leader is Regan, the overachieving maid of honor known appropriately as the Hannibal Lecter of bridesmaids. Although resentful of Becky's happiness, she is determined to make sure the wedding goes off without a hitch, a challenge given that she inadvertently ripped Becky's wedding dress during a drunken binge with bubble-headed Katie and perennial party girl Gena. The three women desperately figure out how to fix the dress in the middle of the night as they cavort with the various groomsmen out on their own bachelor party. So many moments ring false including the set-up and the lightning-flash changes in the characters just to service the plot, but at least the cast is game. Fresh from playing the understandably depressed bride in Melancholia, Kirsten Dunst appears to savor her mean-girl turn as Regan with surprising acuity and fearlessness. I give her credit for not being afraid to come across as unlikeable. Playing a more extreme version of the obsessed sister she played in Wedding Crashers, Isla Fisher plays Katie with nervy comic abandon and obviously reflects her husband Sacha Baron Cohen's go-for-broke influence.Starting with a scene on a plane with Horatio Sanz as she graphically describes how she gauges a certain act, Lizzy Caplan gets to play Gena as the tough-talking chick still aching for the boyfriend who abandoned her when she became pregnant. Adam Scott plays the boyfriend in his typically smarmy manner, while James Marsden gets to play his cynical character in the same vein as Regan's foil. I was surprised to see Andrew Rannells, star of Broadway's The Book of Mormon, play Katie's flamboyant co-worker and the party stripper. Rebel Wilson, who played Kristen Wiig's brain-dead roommate in Bridesmaids, has to play straight woman this time to the nasty trio as poor Becky, though she gets to have a few choice comic moments in the home stretch. Speaking of which, Headland cuts a lot of corners in the third act in a last-ditch effort to deepen the characters. It doesn't really work since any goodwill the movie generated had long since evaporated by then. It's no wonder this movie has shown up on Amazon Instant Video and Video on Demand a month before its theatrical release since word-of-mouth will likely sink the film's chances at the box office. At least at home, the producers have gullible viewers like me who were willing to give it a try without leaving the couch, a big mistake on my part.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R332GIWYJ8VL0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008Y0IMIA#wasThisHelpful","R332GIWYJ8VL0F","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This engaging 21st century take on the ""Pygmalion"" myth provides a welcome return for husband-and-wife filmmakers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine) who bring their unique fluency in capturing human dynamics to this 2012 romantic comedy. Rather than showing the ramshackle misadventures of a fractious family as they did with their first film written by Michael Arndt, the story this time is far more internal and introspective as it concerns a young novelist with a severe case of writer's block and how his mercurial imagination intersects with his otherwise taciturn life. The screenplay is a prodigious first effort by actress Zoe Kazan (film legend Elia's granddaughter) who also plays the title role. She does an impressive job in capturing the exhilaration of fulfilling one man's dream girl illusion but appears less assured in showing the downside. In fact, the familiarity of the story elements and the continually insular nature of the narrative eventually work against the whimsical tone the filmmakers are trying to achieve. That's not to say the film is without its pleasures of which there are many, it's just that the film falls short in exhibiting the audacity and insight of the be-careful-what-you-wish-for theme it sets out to explore.The young novelist in question is Calvin Weir-Fields, whose first novel a decade prior is spoken by the literati in the same reverential tone as J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. He's anxiously trying to start his second novel within the confines of his pristine white LA home, but he can't seem to get inspired until he starts dreaming about a girl who becomes his fictional romantic ideal. Encouraged by his avuncular therapist Dr. Rosenthal, he begins writing about her on his vintage Olympia typewriter and conceives an unconventional, guileless artist named Ruby Sparks. When Ruby unexpectedly comes to life in his home, Calvin initially thinks he is hallucinating, but when he realizes other people can see her, he faces a series of challenges that peel away his preconceived notions about control and love and concurrently expose his unacknowledged narcissism. What Kazan does well as both actress and writer is not make Ruby a pliable automaton catering to Calvin's every desire but rather an eccentric, increasingly emancipated free spirit who gradually forges her own identity much to Calvin's consternation. The premise, however, starts to feel especially thin when the pair visit Calvin's hippie mother Gertrude and her furniture-building partner Mort in Big Sur when new story elements are introduced and then discarded.Reminding me of other movies that twisted fantasy with reality in surprisingly resonant ways, in particular, Marc Forster's Stranger Than Fiction and Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, this film does not feel like Dayton and Faris push the envelope far enough, eventually indulging in the sort of wish fulfillment that the story initially appeared to be deconstructing. Regardless, the filmmakers have assembled an excellent cast. Paul Dano, who played the sullen, silent older brother in ""Sunshine"", plays Calvin with a nicely deft touch without sacrificing the intense vulnerability and angst for which the actor is known. Kazan is an ebullient joy as Ruby, even though Zooey Deschanel ((500) Days Of Summer) has already cornered the market on this type of role. As Calvin's no-nonsense brother Harry, Chris Messina does an effective job as the cynical voice of reason. While it's nice to see Annette Bening and Antonio Banderas gamely cast in atypical roles as Gertrude and Mort, their screen time is limited and their characters rather inconsequential. It's also good to see Elliot Gould play it straight for a change as Rosenthal.

"To state that Christopher Nolan's crescendo-building finale to the Dark Knight trilogy is richly plotted is a gross understatement. There is so much going on in the intricately detailed screenplay co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan that it's a wonder that he pulls it off with not only cinematic gusto but with surprising clarity. In fact, the artistic success of this epic 2012 adventure has primarily to do with Nolan's virtuosic filmmaking style which reflects an uncompromising level of commitment that stubbornly doesn't translate into the level of Cameron-level hubris you would expect from such a surefire studio rainmaker. In fact, as he showed most effectively in 2008's The Dark Knight, Nolan can take the most ludicrous material and invest it with so much belief and inflate it with unbounded imagination and intelligence, so much so that he can overcome any lingering skepticism (if not endless critical feedback) that belabors the incredulousness of the venture. Unlike 2010's Inception, where he does get carried away with the blinking creativity of its mind-altering concept, the well-grounded myth of Batman tethers him irrevocably to the fastidious demands of an established fan base of not only the 73-year-old comic books but of the movies themselves from the serials in the 1940's to the Tim Burton pictures to ""The Dark Knight"". He also has a firm grasp on the narrative from an emotional standpoint and can still stage a sharp albeit often far-fetched action scene.Although it's only been four years since the release of ""The Dark Knight"", the story has moved forward eight years since the pivotal moment when Batman disappeared after taking the blame for D.A. Harvey Dent's crimes in order to salvage the hope he represented to the populace in the wake of the Joker's rampage.  Those intervening years have been an extended period of quiet for Gotham City, but it's all based on a deception of misplaced heroism. Bruce Wayne's lifelong love Rachel Dawes was killed in a fiery explosion, and he has become a recluse in his manor under the delusion that she was leaving Dent for him. A clever jewel thief named Selina Kyle unexpectedly enters his life stealing his mother's pearls just as Wayne Enterprises begins to crumble due to Wayne's long-standing absence from the board.  He retreats from his decision to invest in board member Miranda Tate's clean energy, fusion power project after he learns that the core could be modified to become a nuclear weapon. At the same time, a brutalizing terrorist named Bane makes his debut in Gotham City attacking the stock exchange and forcing Wayne to liquidate his assets. Although the act appears initiated by the Machiavellian impulses of a rival board member, the ensuing revolution turns out to cut much deeper as a war against the wealthy with the entire city being held hostage and a deeply personal vendetta against Wayne that inevitably goes back to the story in the first film, 2005's Batman Begins.To give away any more would be sacrilegious. Suffice it to say the circumstances become dire leading to powerful images of devastation and visceral showdowns that don't disappoint. If anything, Nolan eschews much of the expected violence in favor of genuine suspense probably due to the pre-release speculation of rabid bloggers who were trying to guess how Nolan would wrap up all the storylines. Obviously if you have some idea of the original comic book storylines, you'll know where the plot is going. Regardless, Nolan has really figured out how to provide the film a climax that is ultimately satisfying. As both Wayne and Batman, Christian Bale proves that he is the actor who best understands the dichotomy of the mythically contrarian role, and in this film, reveals the vulnerability of a fallen public figure with the appropriate gravitas. Several other veteran actors are back for their third round and reveal more depth to their characters - Michael Caine conveying the burdensome weight of Alfred's melancholy while witnessing Wayne as he tortuously resuscitates his secret identity, Morgan Freeman erudite as ever as Wayne's armorer Lucius Fox, and an especially effective Gary Oldman, who as the world-weary Commissioner Gordon, agonizes over the guilt of his long-held secret about Batman and Dent. Even Cillian Murphy and Liam Neeson show up to reprise their previous roles as Dr. Jonathan Crane and Ra's al Ghul, respectively, in memorable cameos.Nolan also scooped up members of his ""Inception"" ensemble for key roles - a comparatively pallid Marion Cotillard as Wayne's benefactress and burgeoning love interest Tate, Joseph Gordon-Levitt showing more grit than before as police officer John Blake whose idealism remains unabated despite the grim circumstances, and Tom Hardy virtually unrecognizable as the menacing Bane, a deliberate contrast to the chaotic anarchy of Heath Ledger's well-missed Joker. In particular, Hardy sharply conveys the imposing physicality and florid pontification of a relentless terrorist leader, and he and Bale engage in a couple of hand-to-hand combat sequences that viscerally epitomize the good-versus-evil conundrum at the center of the story. The biggest surprise of the cast turns out to be Anne Hathaway who eschews her usually sunny screen persona with infectious abandon as Catwoman (although she is never referred by this moniker in the film). She not only captures her character's slinky amorality and acrobatic moves but also provides clear insight into Selina's nihilistic behavior with welcome economy. It's also her character who acts as a touchstone in announcing to Wayne the coming revolution, which has obvious parallels to the Occupy movement that has monopolized recent headlines. In fact, the one storytelling misstep may be an underlying presumption that an anti-Wall Street screed would automatically establish the moral tone of the film when I think more widespread evidence of such villainy is warranted versus the greed-driven acts of a single company's board.But let's not forget this is all based on a comic book, and on that level, it enthralls with impressive set pieces, state-of-the-art gadgetry (the high-flying ""Bat"" is cool), and thrilling action sequences beginning with an airplane dismantling sequence worthy of James Bond. I applaud Nolan for not being afraid to stage the group fight scenes with the deliberately superficial expedience of the original TV series. He also doesn't harp on any particular political agenda (despite what professional critics and rhetoric-crazed pundits may claim) and never forgets that balance in his cerebrally meticulous approach all the way through its 145-minute running time. Granted there are some moments of forced humor I could have done without. Regardless, this is one of the few occasions when I felt the movie was actually not long enough. As you would expect, the film's production values are superb from Wally Pfister's dark-hued cinematography (he also lensed the first two films) to Hans Zimmer's appropriately stentorian score to the outstanding production design by Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh (Gotham City never looked more realistically like Manhattan) to the multitudes responsible for the special effects (the football game scene is a stunner even from the trailer). Despite my misgivings about the overly expository nature of the first film which comes back somewhat in this one, this is a genuinely spectacular finale to a great trilogy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZU3NZ6AJ9CXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LWZWGA#wasThisHelpful","R1ZU3NZ6AJ9CXO","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sarah Polley proves her impressive directorial and screenwriting debut, 2006's Away From Her starring a luminous, Oscar-nominated Julie Christie as an Alzheimer's patient, was no fluke with this incisive look at a most inchoate love triangle. With a title taken from Leonard Cohen's cultish song, this clear-eyed yet melancholic 2012 drama once again showcases Polley's prodigious acumen in capturing the complexity of adult relationships without casting blame or judgment on the parties involved. The focal point of the triangle is 28-year-old Margot, an aspiring writer from Toronto on an assignment in Nova Scotia to write the copy for a travel brochure on historic Louisbourg. There she meets Daniel, also from Toronto where he is a struggling artist and a rickshaw driver. An attraction is almost immediate but not consummated. When they fly home on the same plane, Margot discovers he lives just across the street from her, which complicates matters since she's been married for five years to Lou, a cookbook author specializing in chicken dishes. Their marriage is comfortable, and their interactions reflect a lived-in familiarity marked by cute practical jokes and quirky riffs of humor.But what Margot sees in Daniel is something that's been missing in her life, a sexual spark that excites her, even though she dares not act upon it since she really does love Lou in spite of his foibles - including a certain apathy about their relationship that he thinks is perfectly normal. She could see spending the rest of her life with Lou, but she wonders if he is her soul-mate or whether it's worth the risk to find out if Daniel is really the one. Blinded by desires she had yet to tap in her marriage, Margot knows if she acts upon those feelings, there will come some point where she'll have to make a hard decision between Lou and Daniel. Michelle Williams captures Margot's inner conflict with palpable empathy as you see her character expose her thoughts in moments of quiet in which she is the harshest judge of her actions. It's a shining performance which compares favorably to her evocative Marilyn Monroe in My Week With Marilyn. There is a deliberate vagueness to the two men. As Daniel, Luke Kirby (Mambo Italiano) manages to convey the lure of ""the other man"" without coming across as despicable even though it's clear he wants her from afar. At the same time, it's clear that Margot and Daniel have little in common, and they make you wonder how sustainable their relationship could be.Seth Rogen does something surprising in this film - he acts. He still doesn't stray that far away from his shaggy-dog comic persona, but he realistically shows how Lou's contentment and impassivity bring Margot both lasting security and unresolvable fear and longing. Similarly, Sarah Silverman makes her few scenes count as Lou's plainspoken sister Geraldine, who is married with two kids and an alcoholic just out of rehab, especially when she tells Margot what she thinks of her ultimate decision. That Polley can coax such fine dramatic work from Rogen and Silverman is a credit to her growing confidence as a filmmaker. As a native Canadian, she also presents Toronto as a setting with its own unique identity (versus other directors who use it as a double for New York or Chicago), and her cinematographer Luc Montpellier brings a lushness to the images that adds to the intoxication Margot is feeling. There are still flaws - the ramshackle pace adds to an already lengthy 116-minute running time, and the climactic time-lapse montage feels out-of-place for a film that had tread so lightly before. Regardless, this film should play on a double bill with David Lean's Brief Encounter to show how mores have evolved about infidelity over seventy years. Whatever the outcome may be, the bottom line is that there are no easy answers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GURNG7EV3PIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0086213XW#wasThisHelpful","R3GURNG7EV3PIS","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in the Australian outback in the 1920's, this forgotten 1960 saga is one of those films that has not quite gained a cult following but still provides delights upon discovery. At first glance, it feels like it will be a Disney live-action adventure along the lines of Swiss Family Robinson, but director Fred Zinnemann (just coming off his acclaimed The Nun's Story) presents a more complex dynamic around the Carmodys, an itinerant Irish-Australian family of three who travels from town to town picking up whatever work they can find (thus the film's title), usually driving large herds of sheep from one station to another. Paddy is the ostensible head of one such ""sundowner"" family, a proud man who enjoys being rootless. His steadfast wife Ida and dutiful son Sean, however, have grown tired of the constant movement and want to buy a farm so they can settle down. After picking up refined, jack-of-all-trades Englishman Rupert Venneker as an extra drover and surviving a life-threatening brush fire, Ida convinces Paddy to take a job at a station shearing sheep where she becomes the cook, Rupert a wool roller, and Sean as a tar boy. As Ida collects their earnings in a Mason jar, Paddy starts to get feelings of wanderlust again, and the inevitable family struggle occurs.Now throw in an unaided baby delivery, a sheep-shearing contest, and a horse race, and you get the idea of what goes on in this episodic story which manages to be constantly engaging despite the lack of real conflict in the story. A lot of the credit belongs to the two stars reunited from their previous vehicle, John Huston's Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957). Speaking with a convincing Aussie accent, Robert Mitchum manages to exude his particular brand of machismo without losing his humor and humility as Paddy. A sexily unadorned Deborah Kerr makes plainspoken Ida a tower of tolerance and still holds her own with clear authority. Together they generate a sexy and honest rapport that gives the movie its beating heart and makes the concessions each character make for the other believable. A solid cast provides able support including Peter Ustinov as the erudite Rupert, Glynis Johns (later Mrs. Banks in Mary Poppins) as a feisty bar owner who captures Rupert's heart, and Michael Anderson Jr. as too-good-to-be-true Sean. The economical screenplay is credited to Isobel Lennart (Funny Girl) but was mostly penned by the author of the source novel, Jon Cleary. David Lean's favorite cinematographer Jack Hildyard (The Bridge on the River Kwai) does an impressive job capturing the barren outback in all its sunbaked beauty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QGRUX6H0SP1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JLTRG8#wasThisHelpful","R1QGRUX6H0SP1A","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Julie Delpy really has a good ear for shrewdly observational, overlapping conversations. It started with her Richard Linklater-directed bookends, 1995's Before Sunrise and 2004's Before Sunset, in which she and Ethan Hawke contributed much of their own dialogue (and earned adapted screenplay Oscar nominations for the latter). She then translated her unique gift to her own sophomore directorial effort, 2007's 2 Days in Paris, a romantic dramedy that mined her character's repressed hesitancies about settling down with a neurotic, irritating interior decorator named Jack. Delpy comes back again as the star, director, and writer (this time partnering with co-star Alexia Landeau, who plays her sister Rose) of this 2012 sequel, a culture clash comedy paced like a free-for-all French farce. Although the results are not always fortuitous, her aptitude as a filmmaker has clearly improved since Paris, this time aided by a far more likable leading man, an atypically subdued Chris Rock versus the insufferable Adam Goldberg who is blessedly absent from this film.Delpy herself plays the same character, artist Marion Dupr√©, picking up her life in New York a few years after she broke up with Jack, had his baby, and moved in with Mingus, a talk-radio host. Instead of wallowing in commitment issues, Marion is now juggling a busy life raising her towheaded toddler Lulu as well as Mingus' young daughter Willow, and at the same time, getting ready for an exhibit of her photographs at a gallery. Nevertheless, she is still the same intensely self-doubting woman, a Gallic Annie Hall for the millennium with a saucy temperament. Her relationship with the ever-patient Mingus is put to the test when her recently widowed father Jeannot, her passive-aggressive sister Rose, and Rose's clueless, pot-smoking boyfriend Manu all come for a weekend visit. Delpy wisely uses Mingus as the audience's proxy watching her family as exaggerated caricatures of French stereotypes. This is where she shows a genuinely deft hand in presenting everyone's vitriolic, self-absorbed behavior including Marion who is constantly goaded into childishness by Rose's indirect insults. In fact, her family becomes a comical circus sideshow, a constant public embarrassment forcing Marion to tell a whopper of a lie about a phony brain tumor to her nasty neighbors who want her evicted.Where Delpy goes a bit too far is the somewhat surreal part when Marion decides to sell her soul as part of the exhibit and tries to get it back from the Mephistophelian buyer, who is none other than indie filmmaker Vincent Gallo. Using such an extreme plot conceit, she appears to be overreaching on deeper issues of identity and family loss, but the movie eventually recovers its comic rhythm. The puppet show framing device is trite but probably effective for those who had not seen the previous film. As Mingus, Rock grounds the film with his terrifically caustic performance, whether dealing with the next appalling act of his unpredictable in-laws or talking privately to a cardboard cut-out of Obama for spiritual guidance. Albert Delpy, Julie's real-life father, returns as the Bad Santa-like Jeannot and has a grand time portraying his character's whimsical child-like manner. Landeau has a good time playing the selfish sister from hell as Rose, while Alexandre Nahon, who helped with the development of the story, easily plays the boorish interloper that is Manu. Kate Burton and especially Dylan Baker have a few moments to shine as the intrusive neighbors. Delpy's obvious role model continues to be early-period Woody Allen, and she manages to work in his oeuvre with surprising fluidity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31I4T3QB1DB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HZEJ5W#wasThisHelpful","R31I4T3QB1DB1","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A reboot of the Spider-Man franchise feels awfully premature given it's only been a decade since the first Sam Raimi-directed epic hit the big screen with Tobey Maguire in the title role, and it's been just five years since the release of Spider-Man 3. Moreover, some of us have had the misfortune of seeing the bombastic Broadway debacle that is Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark this past year complete with an unmemorably deafening score by Bono. Here is yet another version of the superhero's familiar origin story presented in this 2012 adventure epic from director Marc Webb ((500) Days Of Summer) and a trio of accomplished screenwriters - James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent (who co-wrote 2 and 3 of the previous trilogy as well as several classic films), and Steve Kloves (who adapted most of the Harry Potter series). Although they go back to Peter Parker's tragic childhood in the prologue, the set-up is otherwise identical to the previous iterations except aspiring actress Mary Jane Watson is nowhere to be seen. Instead, there is spunky Gwen Stacy, a police captain's daughter, the chief intern at the OsCorp Corporation, and Peter's high school crush.Webb focuses much of his movie, especially the first half, to the burgeoning relationship between Peter and Gwen, and this turns out to be a smart move since the screenwriters appear otherwise strait-jacketed by the recognizable constraints of the back story. Raised by his kindly Uncle Ben and Aunt May, Peter is the same brilliant geek and social outcast in this movie, but he's given a more brooding sense of anguish by Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) - who at 28, can still get away with playing a teen. The plot starts to accelerate when Peter stumbles upon his father's old briefcase filled with complex formulas that lead him to an old colleague of his father's, Dr. Curt Connors, now a top scientist at OsCorp.  Connors' focus is on cross-species genetics which he hopes will produce ""a world without weakness"", a personal cause to him since losing his right arm. While at OsCorp, Peter gets bitten by a spider that gives birth to his super powers. When Uncle Ben is later killed by a thief during a sidewalk scuffle, Peter decides to become a vigilante hero who is at odds with the police, which of course, means butting heads with Gwen's by-the-book father.However, things really come to a head with the appearance of the Lizard, who causes havoc first in a fatalistic traffic jam on the Williamsburg Bridge and then at Peter's high school. The inevitable battle of good versus evil takes its toll on the city and on our beleaguered hero with the requisite special effects given a full showcase to bring the movie to a rousing finish. That finish occurs over a wearying 136-minute running time, fairly excessive given the familiarity of the story. Perhaps if the Lizard represented something more interesting than a straight-up Jekyll-and-Hyde metamorphosis, it wouldn't have felt quite as long. Although Webb handles the numerous action scenes with surprising acuity given this is only his second feature film as a director, he brings a level of personal intimacy to the movie that a typical action director would likely have bypassed so as not to alienate the fanboy audience. It's also a good thing that Webb hired two bright actors to bring human scale to the love story at the center of this comic book adventure. Beyond Garfield's solid work, a blonde Emma Stone brings her innately sharp manner to a character that could have easily turned into a simplistic damsel in distress.Together the two attractive leads have a palpable chemistry that bodes well for the inevitable sequels. Last seen as the suspicious academic in The Five-Year Engagement, Rhys Ifans plays Connors with similar caginess and with the help of CGI effects, fulfills his villainous quotient fitfully. The rest of the stellar supporting cast feels somewhat underserved within the story's dimensions. Denis Leary plays Gwen's father with his trademark casual authority but perhaps at the expense of the character's needed gravitas toward the end. With two Oscars, Sally Field can certainly do more than look constantly concerned, the basic requirement here, but leave it to the veteran actress to provide more depth to the fretful Aunt May. Martin Sheen seems to have the best grasp on his character's blue-collar sensibilities as Uncle Ben. James Horner's music struck me as overly bombastic for the stealth-like movements of Spider-Man, while John Schwartzman's cinematography is a bit on the murky side during the nighttime shots, especially during the climax. I just wish the whole venture could have enthralled me more, but despite some clear virtues with this latest installment, Sam Raimi still casts too foreboding a shadow from my perspective.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AEDKE89KHGFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LWZWG0#wasThisHelpful","R2AEDKE89KHGFS","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having never read the late Stieg Larsson's 2005 source novel, an unforgivable oversight I know, I didn't know what quite to expect with this 2011 crime drama beyond what I already knew of director David Fincher's generally dark-hued work (Fight Club, The Social Network). For instance, I didn't know the film's narrative would be bifurcated until the midpoint of its 158-minute running time. One side of the movie belongs to the girl of the title, Lisbeth Salander, a deadened goth-punk computer genius, and the other side belongs to Stockholm journalist Mikael Blomkvist whose latest expos√© of corporate evil about a billionaire Swedish magnate has been declared libelous. Disgraced and broke, he accepts a private investigation job offered by Henrik Vanger, an elderly industrialist who would like to resolve the 40-year-old mystery of his murdered niece Harriet in the Swedish hinterlands up north. The list of suspects, Blomkvist is told, includes several members of Vanger's dysfunctional family, eccentric fascists and Nazis still living within walking distance from his manor.Obviously, as Blomkvist gets closer to the truth, his life becomes more endangered. Juxtaposed with Blomkvist's investigation is Lisbeth's unenviable existence back in Stockholm. Having just compiled an extensive background check on Blomkvist for Vanger, she has just been appointed a new legal guardian, Nils Bjurman, due to her state-declared mental incompetency. Bjurman abuses his authority by forcibly raping her. Lisbeth eventually regains control of her life by blackmailing him in the most degrading manner possible, an act of revenge both horrifying and satisfying. Blomkvist decides to hire Lisbeth to help him uncover the connection between a cryptic message written in a notebook and a series of murders that occurred from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s. The labyrinth plot escalates into a series of increasingly revealing connections between Harriet's disappearance and the entire Vanger dynasty, in particular, Harriet's brother Martin, now the CEO of the Vanger Corporation, and their estranged sister Anita, living in London with no desire to reunite with what remains of her family in Sweden.At the same time, Lisbeth and Blomkvist become romantically involved, which naturally brings its own set of complications but also provides the impetus for a final act of revenge. I assume screenwriter Steve Zaillian's adaptation of the source novel remains faithful, but just as important, he manages to present an elaborately plotted thriller with most of the necessary details presented intact. Fincher does an impressive job propelling this complicated story with dazzling cinematic technique and handles the more lurid moments with the same professional ease he displayed in Se7en and Zodiac. However, the meticulous emphasis on procedure sometimes disinfects the movie to the point of making the principals feel more like plot devices racing toward the resolution. At certain points, the plot developments feel as cold as the wintry Scandinavian setting. Despite this tonal discord, the cast works effectively within the story's convolutions and conventions. Even with a variable Swedish accent, Daniel Craig is able to submerge his cool Bond persona just enough to play the wry, middle-aged investigative reporter in a compellingly human manner.Christopher Plummer as Vanger, Joely Richardson as Anita, and Robin Wright as Blomkvist's married editor Erika all play their roles with precise authority and surprisingly convincing Swedish accents. In more challenging roles, Yorick van Wageningen as Lisbeth's abusive guardian and Stellan SkarsgÂrd as Martin are even better. However, it's Rooney Mara (Mark Zuckerberg's scabrous girlfriend in the opening scene of The Social Network) who really gives the movie both its mystique and emotional wallop. With pale eyebrows, shapeless clothing, and awkward manner, Mara's Lisbeth concurrently craves attention and deflects it with almost every movement. The actress makes her character's savant skills and photographic memory perfectly believable and most of all, makes Lisbeth's seeming passivity quietly heartbreaking with a modicum of expression. It's a superb, star-making performance. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth deserves mention for capturing the severity of the chilled images needed to convey the story, while the original music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provides an appropriately haunting undercurrent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V31RTZIIFQ7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y5H5HO#wasThisHelpful","R3V31RTZIIFQ7O","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A studio picture with a premise this contrived shouldn't work, but this 2012 family drama works in ways that are quite unexpected and emotionally resonant because a palpable level of truthfulness emerges with the characters even as the plot teeters precariously on credibility issues. First-time filmmaker Alex Kurtzman, a go-to screenwriter of uber-action fare like Star Trek and Mission: Impossible III, based his personal movie on events in his own life when he met his own half-sister for the first time as he turned thirty. The plot focuses on Sam, a slick, 31-year-old huckster of a salesman in the bartering business. Just as he gets snagged by a bad deal that costs him the huge bonus he just secured to pay off long-standing debts, Sam finds out his father, Jerry Harper, a legendary Laurel Canyon record producer, has died, which means he needs to come home to LA for the funeral against his will. Reuniting with his estranged mother Lillian becomes challenging enough, but Sam also discovers that his father left him $150,000 in his shaving kit.The catch is that it comes with instructions to deliver the cash to an 11-year-old named Josh, who happens to be the son of Frankie, a half-sister he didn't know he had. Tempted to keep the cash himself, Sam finds Frankie and follows her to an AA meeting where she shares the sudden news of her father's death and the hurtful anger she feels for not being publicly acknowledged as his daughter. Her pain is what becomes the common bond that she and Sam share and the beginning of a web of lies he tells her in order to build upon his newly discovered family ties. It's this thread of deception that propels Kurtzman's storyline, and the moment you start to feel the movie get phony, he manages to get it back on track through the burgeoning relationship that forms between Sam, Frankie and Josh. Of course, the further Sam delays in telling the truth, the more catastrophic the results. Perceptive performances are critical in pulling off this kind of drama, and Kurtzman coaxes strong work from his cast.Chris Pine captures Sam's manic energy and evasive nature to a T, and he manages to reveal the vulnerability underneath that shows he never quite gave up on his quest for his father's approval and love. Still etched in my memory as the hot-to-trot bookstore clerk in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Elizabeth Banks has matured as an actress and delivers a genuinely empathetic performance as Frankie, a single mother struggling with a hardscrabble life and a smart, troublemaking son. She and Pine manage a nice rapport that skirts the incest minefield that could have occurred in lesser hands. Too long off the screen and still looking like People Magazine's most beautiful woman, Michelle Pfeiffer makes her few scenes count as the newly widowed Lillian, who met Jerry back in the seventies when she was a former hatcheck girl at the Troubadour and dreamed of becoming the next Joni Mitchell. She succinctly shares her anger toward Sam for his indifference toward Jerry while slowly revealing her own secrets and fears. As the precocious Josh, Michael Hall D'Addario is given lines only an 11-year-old in a mainstream movie would speak, but he is such a likeable young actor that he manages to come across as authentic.Olivia Wilde has a thankless role as Sam's put-upon girlfriend Hannah, but she provides more depth than the plot device she represents, while indie mainstay Mark Duplass (Humpday) seems to be showing up everywhere these days, this time as Frankie's conveniently available downstairs neighbor. There are cameos from familiar character actor Philip Baker Hall (50/50) as Jerry's attorney friend and Jon Favreau as Sam's belligerent boss. A.R. Rahman (Slumdog Millionaire) provides the original music, while cinematographer Salvatore Totino (The Da Vinci Code) really captures the vibrancy of LA life beyond the stereotypical images. Kurtzman sometimes abuses quick cuts to emphasize Sam's restlessness, but when the truth is revealed in the story, it reinforces the message he sincerely conveys in appreciating the value of family and the importance of forgiveness. His clever use of home movies to bring this message home results in the heartbreaking impact that was obviously intended. I definitely recommend this surprising movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H4VMT75LGEH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008220AOO#wasThisHelpful","R3H4VMT75LGEH7","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If this movie was made in the 1950's and trust me, many of the character sensibilities and melodramatic plot turns feel of that period, then this old-fashioned 2012 romantic drama would be marketed as a ""date movie"", one you would have seen in a drive-in as you try to figure out if you're going to make it to third base with your date. It would have starred Troy Donahue and either Connie Stevens or Suzanne Pleshette with plenty of picture-postcard scenes as they decide should they or shouldn't they.  Granted, this film goes well past that question but still ponders the enduring power of love against the odds of amnesia, overbearing parents, a snarky ex-boyfriend, and a bohemian lifestyle that still seems quite comfortable. Credited to no less than three writers - Abby Kohn, Marc Silverstein, and Jason Katims - and directed by Michael Sucsy, the story is based on the true experiences of a devoutly Christian couple who amazingly went through the trials depicted here, and even though the religious element could have brought an intriguing angle to a more audacious filmmaker, it's removed in this version to broaden its audience appeal. It also makes the whole venture feel more manufactured and ultimately generic.Paige and Leo are an attractive pair of kindred artistic soulmates who fall desperately in love. Everything is beyond euphoric for them until a snowstorm forces a truck to skid uncontrollably and sends Paige headlong through their front windshield right after she unbuckles her seatbelt to smooch Leo. Paige later awakens from a coma to see Leo at her bedside and thinks he's her doctor. It turns out the collision has erased the last five years of her memory. She doesn't remember not only meeting and marrying Leo but also leaving law school to become an avant-garde sculptor and vegetarian. We find out she has completely forgotten her estrangement from her status-conscious parents who want to see her reunite with Jeremy, the businessman fianc√©e she had dumped before even meeting Leo, a struggling music producer. Consequently, she starts to revert back to her earlier self, and it is apparently up to Leo to reignite the chemistry that brought them together in the first place. If the set-up wasn't based on reality, there could have been the makings of an interesting psychological thriller or even a dark comedy, but the whole story is played straight-up for maximum tissue usage.Although I am beginning to appreciate his comic skills elsewhere (21 Jump Street), the lunkish Channing Tatum has to work overtime to come across as anything more than this generation's Troy Donahue as the tortured Leo, but the by-the-numbers script, especially his psycho-babble voiceover, works heavily against him. Rachel McAdams showed early promise in Mean Girls, but with few exceptions, her career has lately been a series of romantically hazy heroines caught in soul-searching dilemmas (The Notebook, The Time Traveler's Wife). Her Paige whether in before or after modes is no exception to this increasingly tired pattern. The normally likeable Scott Speedman is relegated to the cardboard role of resentful suitor as Jeremy, while Sam Neill is all greed and bluster as Paige's father. A surgically altered Jessica Lange barely registers except for one late scene with McAdams that finally moves the plot toward its inevitable resolution. Life-changing accidents have figured prominently for as long as cinema has been around from Magnificent Obsession to While You Were Sleeping, but previous executions better reflected their times or at least situations that feel more realistic than the true-life story here.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLN38T99THXB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIGSM#wasThisHelpful","RLN38T99THXB3","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a unique and more courageous movie lurking on the fringes of screenwriter and first-time director Lorene Scafaria's whimsical, melancholic take on Armageddon, but this relatively low-key 2012 drama has a change of heart at the two-thirds mark that makes the inevitable ending feel almost conventional relative to its idiosyncratic start. Instead of dealing with mankind's fate in a special-effects-laden extravaganza, Scafaria blessedly reduces the scale to ponder how a small circle of people respond to the prospect of impending oblivion. In this respect, her humanistic approach is similar to Lars von Trier's recent Melancholia where the focus was on two sisters with opposing sensibilities. This film focuses on a more unlikely pair - Dodge Petersen, a menopausal, emotionally wounded insurance salesman and Penny Lockhart, a free spirit hypersomniac with a passion for classic vinyl records. The plot starts simply enough when a radio announcer nonchalantly announces that the last-ditch attempt to avert a seventy-mile-wide asteroid named Mathilda has failed.Dodge's wife runs away immediately upon hearing the news, while their friends decide to end their days with uninhibited debauchery, excessive amounts of alcohol, and heroin injections. At first, the nearly catatonic Dodge doesn't alter his daily routine as he goes to his office and finds people disappearing and committing suicide in the face of the disaster. He eventually decides to seek out his long-ago love Olivia, and his bohemian neighbor Penny wants to help him in exchange for the possibility that he can find her a way to get back home to her family in England. The movie then turns into a road trip where, of course, they meet up with a series of eccentrics, all the while forming an alliance that turns unsurprisingly into love. The early scenes like their encounter with the hedonistic, lascivious staff at a TGIF-like restaurant are quirky, unexpected, and funny in an absurdist way. However, when Dodge starts to recognize his do-or-die attraction to Penny, the transition is barely apparent, and the rush of romanticism never feels quite authentic, especially in light of the ensuing episodes which become increasingly predictable.It's quite possible that Scafaria intended the shift in tone to be subtle to the point of non-existent, but it leaves a bit of an emotional vacuum which the actors have to fill in with their performances. By now, Steve Carell is no stranger to the sad loner character he portrays here, having done similar duty in Little Miss Sunshine, Dan in Real Life, and last year's Crazy, Stupid, Love, and there is definitely a feeling of retread in his work here. Yet, his innate likeability and common-man sensibilities eventually won me over. In a change-of-pace from her more histrionic roles, Keira Knightley captures Penny's sprightly mannerisms nicely, although I have to admit her off-kilter performance sometimes feels like an impersonation of Kate Winslet's Clementine in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. While a nice rapport develops between Carell and Knightley, the romantic sparks never really ignite in any compelling way to make us feel more resonantly about their characters' fates. Still, there is a lingering sweetness to the whole enterprise that's hard to resist, and I found myself hoping there was some other way to end a movie that telegraphs its intentions from the outset.There are lots of recognizable faces in small roles and cameos sprinkled throughout - Rob Corddry as Dodge's nihilistic neighbor, a nicely comic Connie Britton as his horned-up wife, Melanie Lynskey as the wanton woman who they throw to Dodge to provide instant gratification in the remaining days, Patton Oswalt as another neighbor taking full advantage of the open floodgates for available sex, Adam Brody as Penny's over-sensitive current boyfriend, Derek Luke as her humorless survivalist ex-boyfriend, William Petersen as a somewhat suspect trucker, T.J. Miller as the stoner-friendly restaurant host, and Martin Sheen as Dodge's estranged father. The music on the eclectic soundtrack is well chosen from Frank Black's ""In My Time of Ruin"" to the Hollies' ""The Air That I Breathe"" to Herb Alpert's ""This Guy's in Love with You"". It's worth seeing just to see a different take on a hopelessly curious premise, but the execution is not as uniquely individualistic or emotionally resonant as I was hoping it would be.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39DZDL7T0FOJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007L6VRBM#wasThisHelpful","R39DZDL7T0FOJ2","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you love the exuberant singing on Glee, chances are pretty good you will like this predictable 2012 musical and overlook the numerous plot deficiencies that bring the characters into a climactic singing competition. Naturally that means a lot of rehearsal filled with Whitney-style, gospel renditions of familiar Top 40 pop classics. On this level, it doesn't disappoint since the churchy arrangements bring out a roof-raising soulfulness that is otherwise missing from the flimsily plotted film. Energetic performances of Michael Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"" and Paul McCartney's ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" definitely deliver the goods at key moments, but director/screenwriter Todd Graff (Camp) relies on tired stereotypes and down-home hokum to fill out the framework of a story about a small Georgia town hard hit by the current economic downturn. Providing a beacon of light is the Sacred Divinity Choir anchored by two divas with opposing sensibilities, the conservative and financially struggling Vi Rose Hill and the saucy and wealthy G.G. Sparrow.The movie wastes no time in giving G.G.'s husband Bernard a fatal coronary even before the opening credits are complete. The uptight church pastor needs to find a successor and chooses Vi Rose over G.G. setting the stage for a stylistic war over the choir's musical direction. Naturally, Vi Rose prefers traditional gospel, while G.G. wants a more contemporary twist to the arrangements, which suits Vi Rose's 16-year-old daughter Olivia just fine since she is a budding soloist with those gymnastically limber, Mariah-inspired pipes you either love or hate. Complicating matters is G.G.'s juvenile delinquent grandson Randy, who of course, turns out to be a talented singer in his own right and falls head-over-heels for Olivia. Once you add Olivia's quirky younger brother Walter, who turns out to have Asperger's Syndrome, and Manny, a conveniently talented guitarist and Randy's rival for Olivia's affection, you have the makings of a suspense-free, by-the-numbers soap opera with the sophistication of a young adult novel.It wouldn't be giving much away to state that it all climaxes with a face-off between the choir and the prodigious Our Lady of Perpetual Tears youth choir, spotlighting lead singer Ivan Kelley Jr., who impresses with his knockout version of Billy Preston's ""That's the Way God Planned It"". The choir counters with a rousing medley of Sly and the Family Stone, Usher, Chris Brown and Stevie Wonder's ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours"". Outside of the singing, the performances are serviceable and little more. Queen Latifah and a cosmetically altered Dolly Parton play Vi Rose and G.G. to their accustomed, outsized personalities. As Olivia, Keke Palmer (grown up from her impressive turn in Akeelah and the Bee) has a strong set of pipes as does current Broadway sensation Jeremy Jordan (Newsies) as Randy, but neither makes much of an impression otherwise. Poor Kris Kristofferson has barely a moment as Bernard and then shows up later in a fantasy duet with Parton on her touching ""From Here to the Moon and Back"". Jesse L. Martin (Rent) is also wasted in a small role as Vi Rose's estranged husband who escaped to the Army when he couldn't find a job. This is a highly conventional, clich√©-driven film that is probably best left as a soundtrack purchase.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17VIZZFWDGZD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HHWJSA#wasThisHelpful","R17VIZZFWDGZD4","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It does seem a shame to cast three generations of compelling actresses as a dysfunctional family and then let them drown in a sea of tired character clich√©s and pop psychology babble. But that's exactly what happens in director Bruce Beresford's 2012 dramedy, a touchy-feely, throwaway vehicle for Jane Fonda, Catherine Keener, and Elizabeth Olsen (Martha Marcy May Marlene), who all try hard to rise above the broad brushstrokes that mark the superficial script by first-time screenwriters Joseph Muszynski and Christina Mengert. There isn't a single surprise that would make anyone reconsider the trite nature of the cross-generational conflict on display here, and Beresford doesn't help matters by the film's odd pacing where the basic set-up is presented in the first three minutes at which point the principal characters go through the most formulaic transformations in an expeditious manner similar in depth to a Lifetime TV-movie.The story begins as Diane, an uptight Manhattan lawyer, is suddenly informed by her husband that he wants a divorce. Instead of discussing the matter, she packs up her two teenaged children - self-righteous vegan daughter Zoe and aspiring filmmaker son Jake - and visits her mother Grace up in Woodstock even though they haven't spoken in twenty years. Of course, Grace is Diane's exact opposite, a free spirit hippie artist, a political rabble-rouser and a successful pot dealer, so naturally conflict ensues immediately. While the perennially glum Diane glares judgmentally at Grace, both Diane and Zoe, of course, find love with local men who are their polar opposites - Diane with a laid-back carpenter and singer named Jude, Zoe with a sensitive butcher named Cole. In the meantime, Jake annoyingly videotapes life in Woodstock while crushing on a girl who works in a local coffee shop.All the while, grandma Grace espouses spiritually uplifting bromides to everyone about how they need to live their lives to the fullest much like a self-help motivational speaker promoting her latest book. Regardless, it's a pleasure to see the 74-year-old Fonda look fit and loose-limbed as Grace even though I was getting the nagging sense she should be doing a lot more than play this dotty caricature. Playing against type, Keener seems particularly one-note as the mostly dour Diane, and some of her natural looseness as an actress would have helped bring more dimension to the role. Current indie ""it girl"" Olsen shows welcome moments of vulnerability that are severely blunted by Zoe's generally insufferable nature. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (P.S. I Love You) appears to be specializing in idealized rebound love interests, and he plays the emotionally accessible Jude with roguish easy charm.Chace Crawford (Gossip Girl) seems to be playing a younger version of the same male stereotype as Cole inexplicably entranced by Zoe. Nat Wolff (The Naked Brothers Band) provides mostly comic relief as hopelessly naÔve Jake. I'm not sure why Rosanna Arquette is in the film since she's given next to nothing to do. The cinematography by Andre Fleuren nicely captures the bucolic landscape of upstate New York, but I found the original music by Spencer David Hutchings more intrusive than evocative. For his part, Beresford looks to be resuscitating key moments from Fonda's own film of parental alienation, On Golden Pond, but a better story model would have been Lisa Cholodenko's The Kids Are All Right which lent layers of emotional complexity to a family unit challenged by a lack of forgiveness. After all, outside of this formulaic film, life just isn't as groovy as Grace would have you believe.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H6TS3WEMGTJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008220828#wasThisHelpful","R3H6TS3WEMGTJ1","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All too rarely do I come to a Broadway show with minimal expectations and come away feeling like I experienced something quite magical. Like many others, I saw the minor 2006 indie film upon which this musical was based and liked it. I certainly liked it enough to buy the accompanying soundtrack CD because of that soaring love song the two principals, Glen Hansard and Mark√©ta Irglov√°, performed in the piano shop, ""Falling Slowly"". It was a lovely scene in a small movie that promptly went into the inner recesses of my fading memory bank. Now six years later comes the Broadway production, which beautifully expands on the film's insular focus on the couple to include a dozen talented musician/actors to provide the core love story much-needed dimension in order to fill the stage for he audience. The same approach also adds dimension to the 2012 original cast recording which thanks to producers Steve Epstein and Martin Lowe, does an excellent job of capturing the liveliness of the show's Dublin pub setting as well as the melancholic attraction between the mismatched, unnamed pair.Eight of the thirteen songs from the film have been retained, and Lowe's orchestrations build on Hansard's and Irglov√°'s songs with both inventive spirit and becalming restraint. The story is basically the same as the movie - a spunky Czech √©migr√© takes notice of a reticent Irish street musician where she becomes entranced by the passion of his talent. His character's self-penned songs - all written by Hansard and Irglov√° - reflect the still-broken heart he has over a break-up with a girl who had moved to New York, a circumstance that the girl can relate to as she is a lonely young mother unsure whether she will go back to her husband back in Prague. Their relationship evolves into something deeper and not altogether unexpected. At the same time, it becomes clear that the music they create is what will always bond them regardless of where they go. The centerpiece of the recording is, of course, the Oscar-winning ""Falling Slowly"", performed first as the semi-spontaneous duet it was in the film version and then reprised at the end to sum up the story with genuine poignancy. Steve Kazee plays the pained street musician/vacuum cleaner repairman. Onstage, he was a revelation as Guy, and he captures the troubadour portion of his performance here with unrelenting passion and power.As a Kentuckian, Kazee doesn't have Hansard's hangdog brogue or bar-band edge, but he fluently conveys the pain inherent in the now-familiar songs with a purer sense of conviction in a more varied set of arrangements. He manages to lend quiet introspection to ""Gold"", while his intensely personal versions of ""Leave"" and ""When Your Mind's Made Up"" are particularly heartbreaking. More powerfully than Irglov√°, Cristin Milioti sings in a crystalline Bj√∂rk-like voice that unexpectedly soars on her spotlight solo numbers, ""If You Want Me"" and ""The Hill"". At the same time, she harmonizes quite nicely with Kazee. The additional songs elevate the energy level by bridging key scenes. The harmonies in ""Moon"" are great and really evoke the pub setting with clarity, as does ""Abandoned in Bandon"", a minute-long Irish drinking song performed by some of the incidental characters. To highlight the Girl's immediate family, there is even a traditional Czech number, ""Ej Pada Pada Rosicka"", which adds some much-needed ethnic zest to a score that otherwise relishes its Gaelic spirit. As a whole, the recording is incredibly charming and envelopes the listener like an old friend. It's a true beauty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB0R6DMFKU0LC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZKAG3U#wasThisHelpful","RB0R6DMFKU0LC","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to the Nielsen Media Research study released in December 2011, Facebook is the second most accessed website in the US. Nearly half the country has Facebook accounts with around 875 million users, which would make Facebook the world's third most populous country if it was a political sovereignty. On May 17, 2012, Facebook, Inc. held an initial public offering negotiating a share price of $38 valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company. Despite the shakiness of the stock value in the weeks since, there is no getting around the fact that entrepreneurs and enterprises recognize a need for a Facebook presence to partake in a piece of the burgeoning social commerce pie. Social media mavens Brian Carter and Justin Levy provide an effective primer that helps the relative online neophyte get started on Facebook with the intent of optimizing it for business and branding.The book effectively breaks down a lot of features which may not be readily apparent from a personal user standpoint such as how exactly Facebook's News Feed works. Blending top stories and recent entries, the feed is determined through an internal algorithm called EdgeRank and is calculated by the unique mix of friends and pages with which you interact the most. Consequently, you will see more of the types of posts (statuses, photos, videos and questions) you interact with, and in turn, less of those you don't. The co-authors discuss changes in Facebook's privacy policy, how these could affect your business and what you need to know about the limits of online privacy. Moreover, they teach you how to design custom landing tabs, event platforms and measure your Facebook performance. In turn, the co-authors go on to describe how to make the most of advertising campaigns on Facebook and the role of community building around corporate causes, commercial or otherwise.The section on analytics is probably the most critical part of the book because Carter and Levy give clear guidance on how to access data about users and their interactions on a business's pages and how to use Google Analytics and other third-party tools to gain deeper knowledge about their user base. Easily the most entertaining section focuses on the successful use cases for Facebook and how the best pages leverage existing websites by means of the Like button, as well as the chat and comments features. It details how Facebook Credits works and explains why virtual currency is an essential monetization effort by Facebook.  I especially enjoyed the ""Best in Class Facebook Pages"" whose subjects range from Barack Obama to Brian Solis to Volkswagen. Even though the edition I read was published this year, it didn't go into the replacement of the Profile with the Timeline and the controversy that decision engendered. Regardless, it's a solid how-to book for those just beginning to consider Facebook as a viable channel for business development.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S8JJS48XUYZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078974113X#wasThisHelpful","R2S8JJS48XUYZV","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unless you are the sort of cinematic snob who can only appreciate avant-garde short subjects in tiny projection rooms, then chances are pretty good that you'll have a rollicking good time watching this 2012 megawatt adventure epic. I certainly did, and I wouldn't consider myself a die-hard Marvel comic book fan. I enjoyed the derring-do and ironic humor that infused the comic book films preceding this one, but director/screenwriter Joss Whedon really whips together all the formula elements that made Iron Man (1 & 2), The Incredible Hulk (the 2008 version), Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger purely entertaining into something that miraculously makes the larger-than-life dimensions of the superheroes more instantly relatable.  A top-notch cast certainly helps as does the armada of technicians who pull off the effects in all their 3-D, eye-popping glory, of course, but much of the credit really needs to go to Whedon for making this film as much fun as a comic book.Running a surprisingly fleet 143 minutes, the potentially convoluted plot allows Nick Fury, a character heretofore limited to tantalizing post-credits scenes in the previous movies, to take center stage. He's the surly one-eyed leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., the peacekeeping agency who must quickly recruit a team of superheroes to do battle with Loki, the deceitful half-brother of Thor, the Norse deity of thunder. Loki has brainwashed archer supreme Hawkeye and brilliant physicist Dr. Erik Selvig (already seen in ""Thor"") while stealing a cosmic cube called the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of seemingly limitless potential, from a remote research facility. Fury recruits Black Widow, a former Russian spy last seen in action in ""Iron Man 2"", to gather the troops including a highly reticent Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Meanwhile, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor have to learn to get along before facing the enemy.Loki turns out to be the least of their problems as the Tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the Chitauri, which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of Manhattan. While the state-of-the-art action scenes are everything you want them to be, it's really the film's unexpected sense of humor that consistently buoys the story. Realizing the escalating level of implausibility, Whedon smartly provides clever lines and scenes to everyone (and not just Robert Downey, Jr.)  For instance, after Thor proclaims Loki solemnly as his Asgardian brother, Black Widow points out that he killed eighty people in two days to which Thor points out Loki was adopted. Later, in the most crowd-pleasing scene, the Hulk grabs a character by his leg and whip-slams him into the floor like he's beating a dust rag. The defiance of logic and physics is par for the course here, and Whedon's kid-like attitude and deft hand make it all the more exhilarating.The physically fit cast work surprisingly well together as an ensemble. While Downey's scene-stealing as Iron Man is a given, Chris Evans' Captain America, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Mark Ruffalo's digitally altered Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye all get their moments to shine. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston effectively conveys the inferiority complex that drives his villain with slithery cunning, while Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg take full advantage of expanded roles as Fury and Agent Coulson respectively. The mistake most filmmakers make in showing an Armageddon situation is applying too much soul-baring gravitas to the proceedings. That's definitely not Whedon's take as he never lets us forget that we are watching a comic book come to life. It's gratifying to watch a popcorn movie that actually lives up to the hype in all its commercial glory.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27BE6ZTNYTLAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083SBJXS#wasThisHelpful","R27BE6ZTNYTLAD","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Located in a downtown Tokyo subway station, Sukiyabashi Jiro is an inconspicuous subterranean restaurant with just ten counter seats, yet it has the distinction of being the only sushi restaurant with a three-star Michelin rating. David Gelb's meticulously produced 2012 documentary tells the story of Jiro Ono, an octogenarian perfectionist whose constant striving for culinary transcendence has made him legendary among epicureans in the know. He loves his job, as he readily admits upfront, and while a model of stoic diligence and invariable routine, Ono does show his adoration in unexpected ways that manifest themselves through the unassuming pride he takes in his work. He even imagines new sushi creations in his sleep, thus the title. Such an unwavering quest does take its toll on his two sons who must find their way out of his shadow.His younger son Takashi managed to escape the constant glare of his father by running his own premium sushi restaurant in the Roppongi Hills area of Tokyo, one that doesn't bother to compete with his father's. His older son Yoshikazu, however, bears the burden of the family legacy as the one to carry on his father's standards after he retires. Over fifty and still an apprentice, Yoshikazu patiently waits for his turn at running the flagship restaurant foregoing earlier dreams of becoming a race car driver. Since his father suffered a heart attack at seventy, he has taken over the critical task of getting the best fish possible at the world-renowned Tsukiji fish market. Gelb does a particularly nice job of showing the hurly-burly atmosphere of the pre-dawn tuna auctions and the lives of the men running the tiny stalls selling fresh seafood of all kinds. Perhaps by design, the film is comparatively more opaque in having us understand the genesis of the elder Ono's drive toward perfection.While one contributing factor was the absence of Ono's father's absence, it is unclear who actually did influence him to become a sushi chef. There is also hardly a mention of the chef's wife, even though there is an extended passage of a reunion with his childhood pals who characterize him as something of a bully. Interviews with former co-workers shed some light onto the chef's stoicism. In fact, one of Japan's better known food critics admits to being intimidated by patronizing Ono's sushi bar due to the master's overwhelming artistry and attention to detail. Toward that end, I would have liked to have seen more scenes focused on the actual preparation of the sushi rather than simply admiring them on the counter once they are finished. Still, this is a unique look into a man who has not gone gentle into the good night in his quest for the perfect piece of sushi.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVZO4IRBZRT6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UW9WOQ#wasThisHelpful","RVZO4IRBZRT6F","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Among indie-film aficionados, 21-year-old Jennifer Lawrence has lent an impressive-for-her-years gravitas to a diverse array of roles in Guillermo Arriaga's The Burning Plain (2008), Drake Doremus's Like Crazy (2011), and most memorably, Debra Granik's Winter's Bone (2010). She showed up as Mystique, one of the X-Men: First Class in the big-budget 2011 actioner last year, but it was her role as resourceful backwoods survivor Ree Dolly in ""Winter's Bone"" that appears to be the direct descendant of the heroine in this 2012 adrenalin rush of a movie - Katniss Everdeen, just sixteen but an expert archer living in District 12, the poorest of the dozen civilian sectors that make up the future state of Panem. Based on Suzanne Collins' hugely popular young-adult trilogy, Katniss' story is enmeshed in a dystopian society ruled by an unforgiving government seeking to provide penance to its downtrodden citizens through annual televised, ""Survivor""-like bloodletting sports which give the movie its provocative title. Each event requires two ""tributes"" from each district, a boy and a girl, who must participate in a winner--takes-all survivalist match which means a likely violent death for the 23 others who must lose in the process.This gory concept is leavened by new-to-the genre Gary Ross' (Seabiscuit) surprisingly humanistic direction; a sometimes shrewd, sometimes silly screenplay by Ross, Collins and Billy Ray (Shattered Glass); and a sharp cast combining the faces and fit bodies of young Hollywood with veterans who don't appear to be taking the proceedings too seriously. It's over 2 1/2 hours long, so the pacing has to be quicksilver, and Ross manages to keep the momentum up for most of the story. In the introductory sequence, District 12 is represented as a tableau of Dorothea Lange-style images reminiscent of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl in ""The Grapes of Wrath"". Katniss lives with her passive mother and worshipful younger sister Prim. As fate would have it, Prim is chosen out of a raffle-like fishbowl to be the district ""tribute"" at which point Katniss unhesitantly volunteers to take her place. She is paired up with an oppressed baker's son named Peeta, who is more than willing to play by the rules to win the game. They are whisked off to the Capitol where along with the rest of the ""tributes"", they are groomed and trained in a style akin to ""American Idol"". This part of the movie is more predictably entertaining given the sly, satirical jabs at current reality-TV programming.Once the games finally begin in the forest, it becomes more of a standard adventure action yarn albeit with some clever twists that recall scenes from Peter Weir's underrated The Truman Show. However, the events start to feel by-the-numbers as the ""tributes"" meet their inevitable fates in orderly succession. Give Ross credit for not belaboring the violent elements in order to maintain the film's PG-13 rating. What I liked most about this part of the film was not so much the burgeoning relationship between Katniss and Peeta (which feels a bit more emotionally removed perhaps due to what may be coming in the sequels) but the poignant connection between Katniss and young Rue, which culminates into the film's most moving moments. Less effective are the handheld camerawork by Tom Stern and the agitated editing by Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling, both elements making it sometimes difficult to figure out what is going on at any given moment. Moreover, the movie loses whatever social consciousness it had at the beginning save for one racially motivated scene of violence. In spite of these flaws, Lawrence gives the movie a much-needed soul as she drives the film's fanciful narrative through her stoic yet penetrating nature.Josh Hutcherson (The Kids Are All Right) doesn't make as vivid an impression as Peeta but handles the role serviceably, while it seems fairly obvious Liam Hemsworth's curtailed role as Gale, the smitten boy Katniss leaves behind, will be more prominent in the sequel. Among the ""tributes"", Amandla Stenberg shines brightest in the spotlight role of Rue. More exaggerated turns are provided by Woody Harrelson as drunken mentor Haymitch Abernathy, Elizabeth Banks as garishly garbed escort Effie Trinket, and Stanley Tucci as preening blue-haired emcee Caesar Flickerman, a Ryan Seacrest-doppelganger. Relatively more subtle are Lenny Kravitz (complete with gold eyeliner) as Katniss' compassionate stylist Cinna, Wes Bentley as sinister show producer Seneca Crane, and a lionized Donald Sutherland as the President. Production designer Philip Messina and costume designer Judianna Makovsky deserve kudos, even though Katniss's flaming-red (literally) evening gown was underwhelming. For such an obvious franchise, the film manages to entertain for most of its running time, even if parts feel quite derivative of other films like The Running Man and even ancient relics like The Most Dangerous Game. It's a pretty effective start to the trilogy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJE5RCZMQAFX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084IG8TM#wasThisHelpful","RJE5RCZMQAFX5","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To state that French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius appreciates the artistry and emotional appeal of classic silent cinema would be a severe understatement. He devours it like only a true cineaste would and brings a unique deftness to such a long-forgotten medium that he singlehandedly brings it back to life if only for this one instance. Mostly silent with title cards and shot entirely black-and-white, this stylish 2011 dramedy starts in 1927 Hollywood as pre-Depression audiences were still enraptured by the heart-palpitating derring-do of matinee idols like Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and John Gilbert on the silver screen. As Norma Desmond said in Sunset Boulevard, ""We didn't need dialogue. We had faces then."" And indeed Hazanavicius has found the appropriate doppelganger in his constant star Jean Dujardin portraying an amalgam of Fairbanks, Gilbert and Rudolph Valentino with a touch of Charlie Chaplin (notable in his comic scenes with the dog) and a little Gene Kelly-style hoofing thrown in for good measure.Dujardin plays George Valentin, one of the silent screen's leading lights whose charming braggadocio is more than offset by his popularity. At the premiere of his latest romantic espionage caper, he has a ""meet-cute"" run-in with the fittingly named Peppy Miller, a pretty extra fumbling for her autograph book on the red carpet. He is immediately impressed with her beauty as well as her moxie, and in another ""meet-cute"" run-in, by her terpsichorean talent as well. Once their mutual attraction is established, the plot follows a standard A Star Is Born storyline by showing his career in decline while hers is on a fast rise with the advent of talkies. There is a buoyant spirit that infuses the story and sideswipes the more tragic elements one would expect from previous versions of this tale. That's how Hazanavicius manages to engage the viewer even though the film slows considerably during the middle section despite his meticulous efforts. There are also recognizable tributes to silent classics like F.W. Murnau's Sunrise and King Vidor's The Crowd and even a wink to the classic breakfast montage in Orson Welles' Citizen Kane to illustrate how Valentin and his icy wife drift apart.Some of Valentin's most vulnerable moments are beautifully rendered like the puddle of liquor on the glass table, his window reflection against the tuxedoed torso of a mannequin, and a sure-to-be-classic nightmare scene where he hears every sound except his own voice. The movie jumps back to life with a surprisingly exhilarating ending that subtly explains the key dramatic point of the story. Dujardin immerses himself completely into the essence of his embattled, vainglorious character without a trace of irony. It's a genuinely exquisite performance that could have easily disintegrated into self-parody in less assured hands. What's more, the man can really dance. B√©r√©nice Bejo (who also happens to be the director's wife) is lovely and vivacious as Peppy, although there are moments when she comes across as a mite too contemporary to be truly convincing as a period character. Take, for example, the fist pump she shows when she wins her first audition. At the same time, when she puts an arm through the sleeve of a jacket on a hanger and caresses herself with a hand she imagines to be his, she handles this piece of pantomime with true aplomb.The two French stars are surrounded by familiar American faces like John Goodman as a Jack Warner-like, cigar-chomping producer; James Cromwell as Valentin's dutiful chauffeur; Penelope Ann Miller as Valentin's shingle-haired, ignored wife Doris; and Missi Pyle as a Lina Lamont-style starlet, appropriate since this film covers the same fertile ground as Singin' in the Rain. By the way, that's Uggie who plays the playful, clever Jack Russell terrier, an obvious paean to Asta from The Thin Man series. Kudos also need to be given to Guillaume Schiffman's accurately evocative cinematography (unlike other pastiches, the film looks like it was made in 1927), Laurence Bennett's production design (including an inventive use of the vintage Bradbury Building in downtown LA), and Ludovic Bource's swooning music score, which includes a snatch of Bernard Hermann's Vertigo score over a climactic scene. Even with all the praise heaped on this film from the critics, it's not for everyone's tastes. Silent cinema, by its very nature, beckons a certain patience from the audience that some will find tedious, and even at a running time of just 100 minutes, the movie still feels a bit long. At the same time, for those who can appreciate it as an art form, Hazanavicius has really delivered quite a treat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27GI54YH7P8ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00782O7IY#wasThisHelpful","R27GI54YH7P8ID","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Through the Amazon Vine program, I was able to get a pre-release version of Anthony Bourdain's debut graphic novel entitled ""Get Jiro!"" which coincidentally comes on the heels of David Gelb's meticulously produced 2012 documentary about uncompromising sushi master Jiro Ono, Jiro Dreams of Sushi. Only the name and professions are the same, as the rest of this comic book is a gory flight of fancy that amounts to a slaughter-fest tailored to the discriminating foodie. Co-written with author Joel Rose (The Blackest Bird), the story depicts the sort of twisted world where people literally kill for a reservation at the best restaurants. In other words, this is black comedy satire as only Bourdain could deliver it, and I wasn't even aware that the celebrity chef had penned a couple of crime novels himself in the late 90's (Bone in the Throat, Gone Bamboo).With 160 pages of vivid illustrations drawn by Heavy Meal artist Langdon Foss, this testosterone-intensive adventure contains echoes of Sergio Leone in focusing on a solitary figure, a renegade sushi chef known for his pensive demeanor until agitated by a random request for a California roll or the ungainly sight of wasabi being stirred in soy sauce. Without any hesitation, he literally decapitates the heads of such ignorant patrons. Such violent acts of bloodshed are accepted in the outer ring of a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles sometime in the near-future. In fact, Jiro's culinary artistry apparently justifies such unseemly crimes. His gifts are so sought after that he becomes the centerpiece of a winner-takes-all culinary war between two formidable opponents. On one side, there are the Internationalists led by the imperious master chef Bob, who blends foods from all over the world into exotic delights. Think if Thomas Keller and David Chang blended together into one megalomaniac epicurean, and you would have Bob.The other side is the Vertical Farm, a movement led by an Alice Waters-inspired figure (not coincidentally named Alice), who prepares nothing but vegetarian and macrobiotic dishes even if it means killing those who stand in the way of her singularly-minded purpose. There is more than a hint of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Leone's A Fistful of Dollars in this tale, and there are salacious hookers, suspicious go-betweens and even an aged pho master who complicate Jiro's path toward sushi nirvana. Clearly, Bourdain had a good time concocting the story melding classic noir and Italian spaghetti western movie conventions with a cheeky look at the elitism that permeates so much of the current food scene. His amusing disdain for Waters is made all too clear with the matronly-looking Lady MacBeth cartoon figure he presents here. This is a fun albeit supercilious browse for fans of this genre, although foodies with more sensitive stomachs may want to wait for the inevitable film version.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17T6YTUANVQZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401228275#wasThisHelpful","R17T6YTUANVQZ9","A13E0ARAXI6KJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13E0ARAXI6KJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So I've played this game every day for month and have completed all the end-game content. I feel like it was not possible to write an accurate review of the game until now, much less (like some reviews) after one week of playing it.PROS:First and foremost (and this is a very very big pro) the game mechanics are nearly flawless and have been from launch. We  unfortunately live in an age where huge release-day patches are not only common, some games are absolutely unplayable due bugs and server issues at release. For a game this complex, Bungie did an absolutely stellar job. Every part of this game works perfectly, every time, and I personally have NEVER experienced any bug of any kind even after several hundred hours of game play. That is unheard of now days. Even a games like Last Of Us, Bioshock Infinite, and GTAV (which I consider 10 out of 10 games, some of the best of the modern console era) had way more bugs and flaws than Destiny.Second, the game is so very well balanced. A game like this usually takes a while to get that right, because we all know that the gamers are gifted at finding exploits. There was only one major exploit at launch, the so-called ""loot cave"", and even that I consider as being an exciting experience while it lasted.Third, the curve of the difficulty and complexity of strikes/raids are spot on. The raid (the last, most difficult part of the game) is awesomely designed. It can be a breeze with great team work, while it is absolutely impossible without it. It takes good communication and unselfish effort, which makes completing it really feel like a group accomplishment and very rewarding. You can only do it once a week (for rewards), and I don't know anyone that doesn't look forward to the day when they get to do it again.CONS:Story. You've probably heard about this aspect. The story is confusing, disjointed, and non-compelling. Half the time I didn't know what I was trying to accomplish or why. You want to keep playing the game because you want to upgrade characters and get new gear, never because of the story. If I can find a silver lining in this, it is that after you play a multiplayer game for hundreds of hours, the originally story isn't really as important any more. But this also keeps a game from being one of the all time greats- for me, in order to be 10 of 10 a game has to get everything right, and this is definitely where Destiny falls short.On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give Destiny an 8.9","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F7G2HQGY3FHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGA9Y3W#wasThisHelpful","R3F7G2HQGY3FHF","A2MEC0T7Q65C7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MEC0T7Q65C7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this for my TV so that loud video games don't bother my wife at night,I have a nice Samsung TV but it does not support Bluetooth headphones. I wanted some headphones to wear when I am playing my PlayStation 3. Unfortunately, the PS3 only supports the Sony PlayStation Bluetooth headphones, which are almost $100.So I bought this instead to use with the LG Tone headphones I already have.This transmitter paired easily with the headphones with no problem and it works fine.One downside is that there is a very slight delay, which is true of all the BlueTooth transmitters. It's not noticeable unless the TV speakers are also on and you can hear that the TV speakers are just a fraction of a second ahead. It is not enough of a delay to where the sound doesn't sync with peoples' lips etc.The other downside is that Bluetooth audio quality itself is not very great. The audio quality of ANY Bluetooth headphones or speakers will never be as good as wired speakers/headphones. So if you are an audiophile or want a serious theatrical audio experience, Bluetooth in general is not a good option for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SUD45902DRHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004B8GF7Y#wasThisHelpful","R3SUD45902DRHW","A2MEC0T7Q65C7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MEC0T7Q65C7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought these to provide extra lighting in my back yard. I have a flood light back there but it only covers the area next to the house.These lights have a sturdy simple construction which I am pleased with. The light itself is definitely a spotlight, not a flood light. Basically, the beam is like that of a bright flash light. It can light up a relatively small area like a doorway or stair pretty bright, but if you are wanting to light up a larger area you will need more than one. I put three in my back yard, attached to trees at different angles, and this lights up the yard pretty good.The motion sensor works well and easily has a range of 20 feet. One downside is there are no settings to adjust. The range of the sensor is fixed, you cant change that. Also, the behavior of the light is fixed- when it senses motion it comes on and stays on for 30 seconds if no more motion is detected. You can't adjust it to stay on longer etc.Overall, for the price and because of how simple they are to use an install, I think this is a great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNBGW4Z6TK504/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008X099PQ#wasThisHelpful","RNBGW4Z6TK504","A2MEC0T7Q65C7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MEC0T7Q65C7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"NOTE: This can be found on Amazon for $300Ok, I own one of these as well as a DJI Phantom. The Phantom is the best drone ever made and some of the best money I ever spent. However, the Phantom v1 with built-in camera costs $500, which is $200 more than the Parrot. The basic model Phantom is $400, but you need to have a GoPro camera to take video.What this drone does good:It is simple to fly and pretty stable. I've taken it out in 15mph winds and it handled fine. Anyone can fly it without experience, and after a few hours of flight time you will be a master. The camera takes decent video which streams to your phone or tablet real-time and the video is automatically saved to your photos. It is pretty rugged and can hold up to some crashes. At $300 it comes with everything you need to fly, and it is ready to go right out of the box.So, why only 4 stars? The main drawback is the control system. It connects to your phone or tablet via WiFi. In other words, the Parrot creates its own WiFi network, and when you connect to that WiFi network you can then use the app to fly the drone. There are two problems with this: First, it only has the range of  a WiFi network, which means that at best you can only fly it around 35 yards away from you before the signal gets weak. Compare that to the average standard 2.4ghz R/C transmitter (like the Phantom uses) which has a range of about a mile. Second, since you use the phone as a control, you control it using the touch screen. If you have ever played a FPS or other type of video game on a touch screen you know how much less sensitive it is than using joysticks (i.e. like the joysticks on your PlayStation or XBox remote). You can also use motion control to fly the Parrot. This means when you hold down a ""button"" on the app, it will move in the way you tilt your phone. Tilt your phone left and it flies left, tilt it forward and the Parrot flies forward. This works really well, as well as it possibly could- but it's STILL not as sensitive as a joystick would be. If they gave you the option to use a transmitter to control it rather than just your phone, this would be a 5 star product.So now I will talk about it compared to the Phantom: the Phantom is more stable, more powerful and faster, can fly farther, and is easier to control. I have taken the Phantom to the edge of the legal flying height for R/C vehicles (400 feet), I have made it zip around at 20 meters per second (45 mph) and with the GoPro3 it takes insanely good HD video and photos. However, the Phantom v1 with a built-in camera is $500, and the basic model  (which I bought for $400) needs a GoPro to take video.So my final verdict is this:If you already have a GoPro- it's a no-brainer. Get the Phantom. The extra $50-$100 is TOTALLY worth it. Same if you want a drone and don't care about recording video.If you don't have a GoPro and don't mind spending around $500, get the Phantom.If you don't want to spend any more than $300 because of your budget, or because you want a drone but don't want to spend more than $300 for what is essentially a toy, get this.It is worth the price, and you will have tons of fun with it.TIP: Buy an extra battery. Each battery has approximately 10 minutes of flying time and takes about 1 hour to charge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL3N5C8G0L810/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FS7SV1U#wasThisHelpful","RL3N5C8G0L810","A2MEC0T7Q65C7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MEC0T7Q65C7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have owned around six different R/C helicopters and quad copters before this, including a Parrot drone, and this is by far the highest quality, the easiest to fly, and funnest I have ever owned.Just today, I took it to my boss's house and he, his wife, and his two daughters flew the thing with no problems with no lessons and just minimal guidance. They have never before controlled an R/C vehicle in their life.Any person, with NO experience whatsoever in R/C planes or helicopters, can learn to fly this in 5 minutes. Within a few hours practice time you will be zipping around at 10 meters per second, taking the thing up to a height of 300 feet or more.With a GoPro camera mounted, you will get the coolest shots of it flying and maneuvering through the park like an Apache helicopter through the canyons of Afghanistan, or high altitude shots of your city like a mini Good Year blimp.HOWEVER, when I say that a person does not need R/C flying experience to fly it and that it is almost totally ready to fly right out of the box, that does NOT mean you don't need a certain level of technical aptitude for this. There is a minimal amount of assembly involved, and you need to be able to read the manuals, watch the tutorial videos, and learn a basic understanding of how it works i.e., ""The three steps to calibrate the magnetometer."" You need to understand how the settings work- how some settings are good for general use, and how some settings should only be used by highly experienced pilots. How having the wrong settings will end in disaster.You need to have the basic ability to read forums and troubleshoot simple problems when they arise. And just like any machine, if you use it for a long period of time, you will have to learn how to do basic maintenance and repairs.While I would certainly let my grandfather or my nephew fly it with no experience, I would NOT expect them to be able to buy it, assemble it and understand it without guidance.TIPS:Buy the prop guards. The Phantom is pretty damn tough, but I would recommend the prop guards even if you are an experienced pilot. They add a whole new level of protection.Watch a bunch of tutorials before your first flight. Take it easy at first, and (while it handles even 15mph winds INCREDIBLY well) try to pick calm days for your first few flights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFEFO4WH1KWYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AGOSQI8#wasThisHelpful","RFEFO4WH1KWYL","A2MEC0T7Q65C7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MEC0T7Q65C7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was so impressed with this quilt.  It is very soft and light weight.  The design on the quilt is embroidered and quite beautiful.  When you see it in person looks so much nicer than the picture.  I got the sage green color.  It is reversible and ivory on the other side.It is filled with polyester microfiber and very soft and cushiony to the touch.  It is 90""x90"".  I bought a queen size and it completely covers the mattress which some quilts don't.  There are 2 pillows shams that fit standard pillows.  So I placed my queen sized pillows by the headboard and the pillow sham pillows in front.  It has a very elegant look.  It's great to be able to change the color scheme in the bedroom from time to time by just reversing the quilt and adding some other little touches to the room.  The best part is that it fits in a regular washing machine and I don't have to take it to a laundry mat to a large washer.  It really makes the bedroom perk up with that sage green color.  It reminds me of  quilts I see on hotel beds in fancy casinos in Atlantic City.  It is very well priced too.

There is a serrated edge sharp knife blade that is 4.5 inches long.  There are 3 rivets holding it together.  The knife has a good weight to it and doesn't need to be sharpened.  They really look like you ordered them from a specialty knife maker.  I am very impressed.  They also have a 5 yr warranty and booklet how to take care of the knives.

"I am gearing up for some holiday baking.  I was looking for a good quality parchment paper.  This one is very good.  It comes in a nice hard box unlike some I have purchased in the grocery store.  It is very sturdy.  It does take a little time to figure out how to open box properly.  The parchment paper is wider and longer too.  The width is perfect for cookie sheets.  There is a very sharp edge to cut the paper to my desired length.  It is great for making burgers to freeze.  I like to put it between the burgers then put in freezer.  When I take them out of freezer they pop right off the non stick parchment paper.  It's also easier to eat healthier since I don't have to use any oils.  One of the best things about it is I can use it over several times.  So it may seem a little costly but it goes a long way.  Also, it comes with a ebook with lots of recipes.

"This is a blue color cleaning scrubber cloth.  It's not your typical scrubber and unlike a sponge it doesn't absorb water.  That is a good thing since it cleans my dishes, pots and pans well with no scratching.  It does have a scratchy feel to it enough to clean well but doesn't hurt the items washed with it.  I still need another cloth to wipe my counters because this scrubber doesn't do good on wiping surfaces since water is not absorbed well, but it's great for cleaning.  It's very light.  Just rinse and leave out to dry. It dries quickly and no smells like wash rags or sponges do.  It's flexible and I can reach small spots with it.  It is about the same size as a wash cloth.

"This is my first time trying cacao powder instead of regular cocoa I buy at the grocery store.  I have found this to be more tasty and very smooth.  I like it's low calorie, sugar free  and 4 grams of fiber per serving.  It really has helped me stay on my healthy eating routine.  Look around on Google or Pinterest and you will find tons of ways to use it.  One of my favorites is fudge baby balls.  There are a great low calorie treat, quick and easy to make.  You will need 1/2 cup of pitted dates, 1 cup walnuts, 1 tsp. vanilla, 3 Tbsp. of cacao powder.  Place all ingredients in food processor and pulse high speed.  Roll into balls. Eat or freeze the balls for later.  You can add 1 tsp. natural peanut butter or for rum balls add 2 Tbsp. of rum.  You can also roll them in coconut.  If you have a sweet tooth you will love them.  I haven't baked anything yet but will be substituting cacao powder for cocoa powder in my recipes.  It is healthier and helps with my energy level in the morning making hot chocolate with it too.

"These straws are so cute.  You get 24 of them in beautiful girly colors of pink and purple.  I am going to use them at a bachelorette party coming up.  This bride is in her forties and will just love them.  They are firm plastic about 7 inches tall.  The top is designed just like a pens even with veins and head with a small hole on top to drink out of.  Then there are two balls lower down at end of pens one above the other instead of even across. They do stand out though.  I would suggest drinking sodas or mixed drinks but no collata type drinks because the hole at the top is very small.  They are also great for adult parties.  I can't wait to give them to my friend.  I really think she will get a kick out of them.

"I was surprised at the size of this knife sharpener.  It's the smallest one I have ever purchased but it's biggest enough for the job.  It fits in my hand with room to spare.  It has a nice rubber bottom that works to suction it to my counter.  There is a black handle just flip itt down to suction it to any surface.  Then just run your knife thru the sharpener blades about 4 times.  The knife comes out very sharp.  Then just pull handle up to release suction.  This is a great kitchen item and takes up no room.

The spatulas are black have a silicone grip handle which are soft and comfortable.  The tips of the spatulas are thinner making it easier to scramble eggs or flip pancakes.  They are heat resistant.  I like I can use them while cooking and not just prep work like mixing.  The silicone is soft and flexible.  They appear very durable.

This moisturizer is very nourishing to my face.  This is my first time trying a moisturizer with manuka honey and bee venom.  It is very healthy for the skin.  When I opened the jar it looked like a beautiful whipped cream.  The cream is light and on the thin side so it's not too thick and heavy on my skin. It absorbs very quickly and there is no greasiness.  I don't wear make-up a lot but I apply moisturizer everyday.

"I really like this hamburger press is cast aluminum.  It is so much better than plastic and will be more durable over time.  The handle is wooden and very comfortable.  The bottom of the press has grill marks when shaping the hamburgers.  This press makes about a 1/4 pound hamburger.  I, separate my pound of hamburger into 4 balls.  I, then  line the press with parchment paper then press one of the balls.  You get a large thick hamburger.  You can always make a thinner burger by using an 1/8 of a pound.  It will still be a large size but not as thick.  It's also great for shaping  meatloaf burgers, and crab cakes.I, then layer the burgers between the parchment paper.  Then,  I can freeze them for later use or ready for my grill.  The burgers stay together and do not break apart.  These are the best looking burgers and the size is consistant.

"This is my first silicone collapsible  bowl.  It is white and trimmed in red.  This is a great bowl for soup for lunch.  You can either take the can of soup and bowl in lunchbox and microwave when you get to work or put the soup in the bowl with the leak proof lid and put in your lunchbox.  The bowl is very thick silicone.  It came fully collapsed and it was hard for me to figure out how to get it opened.  I finally put my fist inside and used some pressure and it popped open.  Then to close it was tricky again you have to push in on sides.  The lid has 4 flaps that go over the bowl and does not keak.

"This is my second robot by Think Gizmos.  This one is a great quality robot just like the last one I received.  This robot is a huge dude.  He is almost 14 inches high.  He does require batteries and the remote does too.  You will need 6 AA batteries to start and they are not included.  It's easy to turn on with a off/on switch on the back.  The robot walks back and forth and slides left and right. It talks, dances with music playing, it's arm shoots too.  Then in the center of his chest he has beautiful rainbow colored led lights  glowing with a circle section to load your soft foam missles.  The robot then shoots the missles.  They are small so you might want to play with it in a room where you will be able to find them.  There are 9 missles with the robot but you only need 6 at a time.  It's arm shoots with a red light.  I did have to play around with all the buttons on the remote to see what they made the robot do.  I am sure a child will probably figure it out faster than I did.  It's very well made and quite durable.  Any child will absolutely love it.  I would suggest rechargeable batteries that way it won't cost as much for batteries.

There are 3 fabric roses on the front with a beautiful mesh like material over laced on the front and back of clutch.  There is a chain you can wear the clutch on your shoulder if you don't want to carry in your hand.

"This is a great set of marble whiskey stones.  You get 9 stones along with a pouch to store them in.  The stones are a small size black with speckles of white.  I need about 3 in a regular glass of soda.  I am one of those people who always has a diet soda on hand.  I seem to nurse the drink and the ice dilutes my drink and wind up wasting a lot.  I just put the stones in the freezer for a few hours.  Then take 3 out and add to my diet soda.  They keep my drink cool for probably an hour or little longer.  Since you get 9 in this set you can always have some in the freezer to use the next time.  They are well rounded so they don't scratch my glass either.

She was amazed how bright the light was and she could move it around and focus in on one spot.  It provides a lot of light for distances too. Well,  needless to say, she asked if she could keep it.

These are better than real down since I have allergies too.  I always sleep with two pillows to keep my head elevated a little.  So I will switch back and forth which one is on top.  This is a very comfortable pillow and enough fluffiness that I can mold it to my neck and head.  I am a side sleeper but do roll over on my back after I fall asleep.  I can put my hands or arms under the pillow and it's comfortable.  These are hypo-allergenic, quited and standard size.  I am used to queen size pillows so these are a little smaller.  They really have the feel of a down pillow but aren't.  They come vacuum  packed.  So make sure to take out of plastic and let them air out. After a few hours they fluff up a lot.

"""The Frozen Dead"" is the d√©but thriller in a projected series of crime novels by French author, Bernard Minier. The action is set in the area around Toulouse, in France‚Äôs southern Midi-Pyr√©n√©es region and introduces the world to police Commandant Martin Servaz and gendarmerie Captain Ir√®ne Ziegler. The original French edition of the novel was published, as ""Glac√© (Frozen)"", in 2011 to much acclaim; this idiomatic English translation by Alison Anderson appeared in August 2013.The Pyrenees provides an unusual and atmospheric setting for the novel which, to his credit, the author milks to the utmost.  Sadly, the book's originality ends with its setting; every other aspect of this story feels formulaic and copy-cat, owing much to a certain Thomas Harris character, as well as just about every other cop murder thriller ever written.The author tries hard throughout to keep the reader on the back foot with endless twists to the tale, as well as by constantly ramping up the jeopardy for the book's characters, in an attempt to build excitement and suspense.  He almost pulls it off, too. Unfortunately, though, every single twist has either been telegraphed in advance or else is so well-tried and formulaic that ultimately nothing is ever a surprise at all. At the same time, the protagonists' frequent life-threatening perils are overcome with the 'single bound' ease of an average comic-book hero, so that these episodes also fail to deliver. Attempts at shocking the reader with sudden episodes of gruesomeness are frequently overcooked, lending the book something of the air of a third-rate horror flick.For a supposedly brilliant man, Commandant Servaz makes some amazingly stupid mistakes, while both he and Ziegler display such a stunning lack of professional judgement at times that it is often hard to take either of them seriously.  The villains of the piece are so patently obvious throughout to everyone except the book's protagonists that often one feels one is reading the book more to find out how the various murders were committed rather than to find out who perpetrated them. (Sadly, this is, in fact, never revealed; I'm sorry if that's a spoiler.)For all its faults, however, there remains a certain promise and a gleam of something original that shines through the storytelling here which could break out into something exciting if the author would but back away from the tried and tested ideas of others. I look forward with interest to the second volume in this series, ""A Song for Drowned Souls"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R201KTY423IBSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250078342#wasThisHelpful","R201KTY423IBSO","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""Arca Protective Carrying Case"" from Case Logic is a robust semi-hard shelled carrying case designed specifically at the 11.6"" Chromebook but pitched by Amazon at any similarly sized tablet PC. Despite the illustrative photo on the product packaging showing an Apple Macbook in it, I found that neither my MacBook Pro nor my wife's MacBook Air were a good fit to the bag, the former being a tight fit, the later slopping around altogether too loosely for real peace of mind.  This is a shame, because the ""Arca"" looks like it would otherwise be a good alternative to those occasions when you'd like to give your treasured laptop rather more protection than afforded by the lighter, neoprene sleeve type of carrying case.I also didn't like the way the case unzips on three sides allowing it to be opened up fully. Although this makes for fairly easy insertion and removal of its cargo, I have found that with this design it is all too easy to leave one side of the case unzipped, resulting in the contents sliding out unexpectedly -- and expensively!The case is supplied with a tough carrying strap, making it easy to carry slung over a shoulder but no other carrying handle. It has no side or internal pockets or pouches, though, so nowhere to carry any small extras such as USB drives, papers or power supply.In conclusion, then, although this product is of a high construction quality, its design limits both its usefulness and its versatility. Hence my fairly parsimonious rating of it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2140BZUNHS9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKN4B36#wasThisHelpful","R2140BZUNHS9O","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ivy Pochoda's ""Visitation Street"" is a lovely read. Partly a mystery story, partly a portrait of a community, the book paints a complex tapestry from the interwoven stories of several individual lives. It explores the many aspects of guilt and loss, recrimination and regret, blame and forgiveness, grieving and growth from which all lives are ultimately constructed.  The author writes poetic prose that imbues the ageing housing projects of Manhattan with a patina of pathos and its denizens with a glow of humanity, turning the district's grime into gold dust that sparkles in the light of the Ivy Pochoda's literary search-light.  Despite the story's essentially tragic nature, the book nevertheless carries a feel-good factor that should win over all but the most hard-hearted of readers. It cries out to be dramatised and filmed.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDTVP0OQC7940/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062249908#wasThisHelpful","RDTVP0OQC7940","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""The Day is Dark"", Icelandic novelist, Yrsa Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir, invokes fresh scenery for the fourth of her 'Th√≥ra Gudmundsd√≥ttir murder mysteries' by setting the bulk of the book's action not in Iceland but in the even bleaker environs of Greenland, in March.  For all of its novel setting, however, the author never really manages to inject any new life into either her characters or her storyline. In this tale, Th√≥ra does even less sleuthing than in any of the earlier books of the series and events are left to pretty much play themselves out until eventually the culprit more or less simply confesses to the crime and everyone gets to go home.  For once, Th√≥ra isn't plagued by her usual attendant domestic issues, whilst even her law firm's irritating secretary, Bella, is only used occasionally to impart a little contrasting colour here and there, rather than providing her usual begrudging assistance.The book does provide the reader with quite a few things to puzzle over, although most of these are not exactly brain-taxing, especially as the author likes to leave many of the clues out in plain view from early in in her books. The novel's main value, though, lies in its evocative portrayal of Greenland -- its nature and its society, both of which contribute to the dark and brooding undercurrent to the storyline.  In many ways, the book foreshadows some of the elements of Melanie McGrath's ""The Bone Seeker"", although without coming anywhere close to that novel's levels of complexity and depth of intrigue.Originally published in 2008 in Icelandic as ""Au√∞nin (Veins of Ice)"", this English language translation by Philip Roughton dates from 2012. Whilst idiomatic, the English version is far from sophisticated -- something that is quite common in translations of contemporary Icelandic writing, it would seem.For established fans of the author, this volume will probably not disappoint. It might even win over some new converts.Irritatingly, the Kindle edition lacks a table of contents, for some reason.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKNB9HPFK0MTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051H5138#wasThisHelpful","RKNB9HPFK0MTC","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Last Rite"" is the fifth and final part of Jasper Kent's ""Danilov Quintet"", bringing to a conclusion a story that spans more than a century of Russian history from Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812 (in ""Twelve"") through to the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. (The intermediary volumes in this series are, in order, ""Thirteen Years Later"", ""The Third Section"" and ""The People's Will"".)Initially, this concluding part gives the impression of being something of a rerun of its immediate forerunner, ""The People's Will"". For once, however, the author manages to pull off a complete surprise in the middle, though, suddenly turning the tale completely on its head and in the process, providing a real quandary for its protagonist.  As a result, the book becomes both a fun and a tantalising read, with its progress and conclusion being far from obvious, even for those who already know the real events of this time.In many ways, this is the best volume in the series since the first one, with the narration capturing many of the conflicting motivational tensions that underpinned that earlier story -- only this time with a very clever twist.  The book also closes out some left-over narrative threads from the earliest volume that many may well have forgotten about.  The book is essential reading for anyone who has followed the story this far; it does not disappoint.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUZ68F7FORWZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0593069552#wasThisHelpful","RUZ68F7FORWZC","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Garnier's ""Ultimate Blends Sleek Restorer Shampoo"" smells like something that would be more appropriately poured over waffles or pancakes than rubbed into one's hair, its coconut oil and cocoa butter mixture being appetisingly well balanced! The product itself is the colour and consistency of good quality maple syrup!In use (in the shower, that is, not the kitchen!) the shampoo lathers up quickly and effectively but beware, it pours readily and it is very easy to apply too much.  It feels good in use, though -- even if it does engender a craving for pancakes afterwards!I've never really had much problem with ""fly-away"" hair, nor do I think that I ever had much ""sleek"" to restore so really cannot comment on Garnier's claims for the benefits of the this shampoo  but it certainly left my hair and scalp feeling good, even without resorting to any conditioner.

"Kerstin Rodgers (aka MsMarmiteLover) is a popular vegan food blogger and professional chef. In ""V is for Vegan"", she presents a wide range of vegan recipes which vary from quick and simple snacks to complex dishes requiring considerable shopping and preparation time commitments.  Her emphasis in selecting recipes for inclusion seems to be based mostly on flavour, with appearance also high up on the list; Kerstin is obviously on a mission to put the lie to the popular misconception that vegan food is necessarily both bland and brown.  The author is also determined to reconnect her readers with what they eat through deliberately involving them more intensively in its preparation -- probably no bad thing in today's culture of ""heat, eat and go!""The book is copiously illustrated but is hard on the eyes throughout, owing to the publishers opting to print every page with a different garish background colour against which the old fashioned typewriter and faux Letraset heading fonts stand out only poorly.  Maybe this is another attempt to move the idea of veganism away from old notions of it mostly being for sandal-wearing hippies, and make it appear more vibrant and contemporary. And, I guess, sometimes tofu needs all the help it can get when it comes to image make-overs!Look beyond the garish presentation of the book, however, and you will find some delicious little (and some not so little) treasures lurking within these pages.

"""Little Black Lies"" is a new stand-along thriller from the pen of Sharon Bolton, author of the Lacey Flint Series of novels.  It is set in the Falkland Isles, in 1994, at a time when the war between Britain and Argentina over sovereignty of the islands a decade earlier is still fresh in the minds of the islanders and those who visit it.This remote South Atlantic setting gives the book an unusual slant and provides the author with a great deal of scope for building an unsettling atmosphere, in which the tensions present in small, tightly-knit communities can be fully utilised to build suspense and drama, whilst also playing to the readers' lack of familiarity with the locale. In this regard, the book has something in common with the Edie Kiglatuk Arctic Crime Series of Melanie McGrath, only set at the other polar extreme.The book utilises multiple person perspectives -- each with a subtly distinctive voice -- to play out a series of inter-connected but essentially personal story-lines set against a central mystery of a series of child disappearances on the islands.  The author does an excellent job of keeping the reader guessing about many aspects of the story, although the central mystery isn't all that difficult to work out.All in all, this is a well-written and very clever story, cast in a refreshing setting and presented in an entirely credible way (for the most part, at least). I suspect that real Falkland Islanders won't find much that they immediately recognise here but equally, I doubt that anyone will mind about that at all. Highly recommended for all mystery and thriller lovers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX9SD71CXCN6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250028590#wasThisHelpful","RX9SD71CXCN6G","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""What Remains"" is the sixth of Tim Weaver's series of 'David Raker' thrillers. After a somewhat shaky start with ""Chasing the Dead"" and ""The Dead Tracks"", this series has gone from strength to strength, through ""Vanished"" and ""Never Coming Back"" to ""Fall From Grace"".  With this latest instalment, the author has really excelled himself; the story-telling is slick, the action well-paced and exciting, the plot every bit as tangled and unpredictable as one could hope for without credulity ever being stretched beyond acceptable limits, as some of the earlier books required.Existing fans of these novels should love this release. It contains all of the hallmark 'David Raker' shocks, surprises and bizarre mysteries, clever misdirection and jaw-dropping plot twists, as well as adrenaline-pumping suspense and gooseflesh-inducing atmospherics.  In addition, this volume finally resolves a story thread which has been running throughout just about the whole series, so providing some closure not only for its characters but also for long-time readers.  As a consequence, of course, while this book could be read in isolation, it will be enjoyed most if you have reading at least some (and preferably all) of its forerunners.  Either way, though, one thing it won't do is disappoint.Unreservedly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ONXM7OJLTJ8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718181670#wasThisHelpful","R1ONXM7OJLTJ8N","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""A Brief History of Iceland"", by Gunnar Karlsson, professor of history at the University of Iceland, was originally published in 2000 (in Icelandic) as a collection of some 30+ double-spread chapters which provide a concise, if shallow, synopsis of the main social, political and economic events in the history of this island nation from its earliest colonisation in the late ninth century to the turn of the second millennium of the Christian Era. The English translation is by Anna Yates has a few oddities -- it appears to be pitched largely for a British readership and yet slips occasionally into US-oriented phraseology and terminology (using ""sidewalk"" rather than ""pavement"", for instance) which is odd but never disturbing.This revised second edition extends the original publication with a new chapter covering the banking collapse of 2010, as well as additional material in the chapter on 'Liberated Women' to include the election of J√≥hanna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir as Iceland's first female Prime Minister in February 2009.The book is comprehensive without becoming too detailed or complex (although, oddly perhaps, no mention is made anywhere of Iceland's history of tolerance of and support for gay rights, nor of it having the distinction of having had the world's first openly lesbian head of government.) As an academic historian, the author steers well clear of most Icelanders' tendency to over romanticise -- or even fictionalise -- events in its history but manages to keep the tone pitched perfectly for a general, novice audience. As a result, the book is provides an ideal overview of the full span of Icelandic history and would make either an excellent introduction to more detailed study, or else provide the interested tourist with a basic understanding of how this island nation became what it is today.  Given the current speed of change in Iceland, however, it will may soon be in need of yet further expansion and revision.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ORG242GFVER2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9979320346#wasThisHelpful","R1ORG242GFVER2","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Let the Devil Sleep"" is the third of John Verdon's novels featuring retired New York detective, Dave Gurney, and follows on from the earlier ""Think of a Number"" and ""Shut Your Eyes Tight"".  The marked improvement in plot construction and tension building that was evident in the second of these novels is carried through into this third, making this the author's best novel yet.Pacing is excellent throughout the book, which is mercifully free of any annoying side interludes. In addition, Dave Gurney's personal issues are much better integrated into this story than into either of the other two and don't interfere at all with the story flow but rather add to it quite considerably.  Although the plot is complex, the reader is provided with more than enough clues to identify the killer long before Gurney himself gets there, which, whilst not saying much for John Verdon's view of America's finest does at least make for a satisfying read.As is generally the case in these novels, the final showdown is terribly over the top but makes for a tense and exciting wrap-up to the tale.  I am looking forward to the next outing, ""Peter Pan Must Die"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CFM1B2P15YWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307717933#wasThisHelpful","R1CFM1B2P15YWH","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A man called Ove is a cantankerous old soul -- in that way old souls generally become cantankerous when they are surrounded by imbeciles and incompetents who can't so much as obey a simple sign, or climb a ladder to unstick a window without falling off, and who don't even know how to repair a bicycle or reverse a trailer any more.""A Man Called Ove"" is also one of the most hilariously poignant reads you are ever likely to encounter any side of old age. In this, his first novel, Swedish blogger, Fredrik Backmann, has managed to capture to perfection the feelings and attitudes that sixty years of honest toil in the face of life's vicissitudes so often engenders. In Ove, the author has created the perfect grumpy old man who wants nothing more than to get on with the business of dying, while the rest of the world has completely different ideas about what he needs to be doing. For an author so young, the book is written with great insight not only into people's personalities and how these affect their inter-relations, but also into the nature of growing old and of the human condition generally, albeit one tempered here with a dusting of comic simplicity. Additionally, the book has an air of farce that offsets the underlying serious message and ensures that it delivers poignancy without any tendency towards cloying melancholy.The book is a funny and entertaining read from start to finish, beautifully structured to reveal just as much of Ove's past as you need at any moment to understand and appreciate his actions and attitudes in the present. In the process, you'll come to love Ove as you would a favorite dotty uncle.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSB03M119GO7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IORP664#wasThisHelpful","RSB03M119GO7N","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""My Heart and Other Black Holes"" is the d√©but novel of American author, Jasmine Warga. Aimed at the young adult market, it tackles the sensitive issues of teenage depression, low self-esteem and thoughts of suicide in a moving, enlightening and uplifting way. It deals with the matters of loss, feelings of individual weirdness, isolation and alienation, and of the salvation that comes about through relationships. And above all, it deals with love, the basic human need for it, and the difficulty that we sometimes have in recognising it for what it is.The book is a captivating read, achieving just the right balance of humour and pathos, with quirky but endearing and believable characters, and a storyline that is tensioned to perfection. Whilst most readers will see quite early on where the tale is heading and are not likely to encounter many surprises along the way, the urge to read on nevertheless remains strong throughout the book. Initially, it is the intriguing individuality of the narrative that keeps the pages turning but the book's protagonist so quickly wins over the heart of the reader that it isn't long before you are reading on because of how much you've come to care about the outcome.For all of its deadly serious subject matter, the tone remains light and entertaining, even through the darkest passages. Jasmine Warga manages to display a rare talent, in writing in a realistic and singular teenage voice to which readers of all ages should have no difficulty whatsoever relating. The book has a host of well-rounded characters, it avoids all stereotyping and, indeed, does much to break them down. The story is both heart-rending and heart-warming (oh yes, and nail-biting). It is wholeheartedly recommended to readers of all ages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMX6A35IIAUHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062324675#wasThisHelpful","RMX6A35IIAUHS","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who has ever spent any time at all travelling by train -- especially anyone who has routinely travelled the same line as a commuter -- will immediately recognise the starting premise of Paula Hawkins' d√©but crime triller, ""The Girl on the Train"". Surely no-one can resist peering into the back yards and gardens or through the windows of kitchens, dining rooms,  conservatories and bedrooms of suburban track-side homes and wondering about the lives that are glimpsed there? For Rachel, on her daily journey in and out of London, it is easier than for most to imagine what is going on, because she used to live in one of the houses she sees into by the side of the tracks where her train stops briefly at a signal each day. Her ex-husband and his new wife live there now but Rachel is no longer a part of that life any more, except as passive observer -- she is merely the Girl on the Train now.  Until, that is, one day she observes from her passing train something that changes her world forever, and which throws her into a terrifying tangle of murder, intrigue and despair; one made even more frightening by the fact that Rachel has a problem remembering things clearly at times, as well as separating reality from fantasy -- a problem that puts her in far more danger than she realises.From this premise, Paula Hawkins constructs a clever and convincing tale of obsession, deceit and guilt -- as well as of modern day suburban mundanity and the baggage that it carries. Masterfully written and well paced throughout, this book is one of the best thrillers to have come my way in a long time. Told from a three-person perspective, almost in daily journal format, the tale slowly reveals the various facets of the main characters in a way that forces a constant reassessment of circumstances and keeps the reader guessing at the outcome right until the very end.Dreamworks have already acquired the rights for Marc Platt to produce the film version even before the book has been published; it will probably make for a cracking movie. It already makes for a stunning and completely unputdownable read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHAIAHY6JO3VR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOPQU2K#wasThisHelpful","RHAIAHY6JO3VR","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whilst the name Charles Darwin is universally associated with the formulation of the theory of evolution of biological species through the operation of the forces of natural selection, the figure of Alfred Russel Wallace lurks more as a spectre behind the scenes of Victorian natural history and scientific endeavour -- if, that is, he is even known about at all. Lacking in any formal education beyond the age of 14 and of poor, working-class background (in contrast to Darwin's own wealthy status and possession of Cambridge degree) Alfred Wallace struggled for much of his life against the prejudices of the privileged-class members of Britain's scientific societies, who passed off much of his hard-won achievements and accomplishments as mere amateur field naturalism lacking the rigours of the scientific approach, or the discipline of academic focus.In reality, Wallace was a dedicated -- some might even say fanatical -- collector of natural specimens and a fastidious documenter of all that he collected, saw or encountered and who explored areas into which few, if any, white men had previously dared venture. In his early twenties, he spent four years exploring, mapping and collecting wildlife in the Amazon rainforest; later, between 1854 and 1862, aged 31-39, he travelled extensively around the Malay Archipelago (now Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia) where he amassed some 126,000 specimens of mammals, birds, insects (including more than 80,000 beetles alone). Several thousand of the species he collected and described were entirely new to science at that time.  In 1869, Wallace published an account of his time in the far east (""The Malay Archipelago"") which became one of the most popular accounts of scientific exploration ever published; it has never been out of print. The most important work that Wallace undertook during those years and which made him famous in his time is largely forgotten today.Whilst Wallace was exploring and gathering specimens throughout the archipelago, he became fascinated by the vast array of animal and plant species that he encountered and puzzled over the often subtle differences which distinguished the species populating one island from those of another. His deliberation on these differences and their distribution led him independently to his own theory about natural selection as the driving force behind the emergence of new species. Mindful of his lack of standing within the scientific establishment, in 1858 he sent a draft article outlining his theory to Darwin for his opinion, and asking that Darwin share the article with Charles Lyell for his judgement also.For Darwin, the knowledge that another had hit upon the very theory that he himself had been developing for publication for some time (but which, by his own admission at that time still required ""many more years' work"") was sufficient catalyst for him to rethink his own plans for how his ideas on evolution needed to be prepared for public consumption. Unbeknown to Wallace, his 'draft' essay, together with a paper by Darwin himself, were presented by Charles Lyell to a special meeting of the Linnean Society of London in July 1858. Both men were credited with independently arriving at the same idea at the same time. Following the meeting, Darwin speedily prepared his ""On the Origin of Species "" for publication in 1859. Wallace, out of touch throughout this time in the wilds of Irian Jaya, remained ignorant of these developments until 1860. He did not return to London and civilisation until 1862, by which time Darwin had spent four years alone in the limelight and the rest, as they say, is pretty much history as far as public recognition of the originator of the theory goes.It is testimony to the character of Wallace that he never exhibited or expressed any rancour over what many at the time and since have perceived as a gross unfairness to him. Every now and then, another article or book emerges trying to rectify things by examining afresh the man, his achievements and his contributions to the advancement of evolutionary theory and bio-geography. The latest addition to this pantheon is ""The Evolutionist"" by Canadian writer, Avi Sirlin. Rather than risk a potentially dry biography (and thereby have to compete with Peter Raby's fairly definitive ""Alfred Russel Wallace"", or even Wallace's own account, ""My Life: A Record of Events and Opinion"".) Avi Sirlin's approach has been to dramatise the events of Wallace's life and present matters in the form of a novel. In order to do this effectively, he admits that he has to invent new characters as composites of real ones, imagine meetings and encounters that probably never took place, as well as to reorder somewhat the chronology of his subject's life.The author has also invented a faux Victorian literary style in which to convey his narrative, presumably in order to evoke something of Wallace's own writing style. Sadly, I found it imbued with too many trans-Atlantic grammar, terminology and spelling lapses for it to feel in anyway authentic. To me, it is merely lumbering and ponderous; it may put many readers off altogether, as it is far from being an easy read. Writing styles aside, though, the book itself is both engaging and absorbing, if also a little lurching in its structure -- how sad that real lives so rarely follow the most satisfying narrative arc!I have no idea how authentic Avi Sirlin's portrayal of Wallace's odd mix of naivety, misplaced self-confidence and rank humility may be, but the author certainly makes a convincing job of it. The books many faults make it hard to give this particular publication wholehearted endorsement but any volume which makes Wallace's name better known (even if potentially for the wrong things) has to be welcomed, even with so many already out there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GUIONDDJFULF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8BNG48#wasThisHelpful","R3GUIONDDJFULF","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mike Hulme is Professor of Climate and Culture at King's College London, UK, and founder of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. His latest book on climate change, ""Can Science Fix Climate Change?"", is a relatively slim volume (150 pages + index) laying out the arguments against climate engineering through deliberate atmospheric modification, particularly through the use of stratospheric injection technologies or other methodologies for implementing a so-called planetary thermostat. The first four chapters of the book present cogently argued reasons why it is unethical, reckless and pointless even to research such technologies, let alone contemplate their deployment. The fifth (and final) chapter wraps up the subject by giving some pointers as to how scientific and engineering endeavours might be better focused by reframing the entire question of managing climate change by concentrating on pragmatic goals more attuned to serving the (global) public good.As an invective against the hubristic and megalomaniacal techno-fix that climate engineering undoubtedly is, the book works well. Where it fails, however, is as a balanced overview of the contributions that science can make to an understanding of the issues that societies generally need to tackle around climate change. Throughout the book, the author generally tars all scientists with the same brush, appearing unable to recognise that whilst would-be climate engineers all operate within the scientific community this does not mean that all scientists are would-be climate engineers or even that they must inevitably be in favour of an engineered approach to climate change avoidance. In reality, of course, the number of advocates for climate engineering in general represents only a small minority of the world's climate scientists, whilst those who openly advocate or pursue research into stratospheric modification -- the geoclique, as Mike Hulme brands them -- is an even smaller group (albeit it one with a disturbing disproportionate degree of influence on the policy making of powerful Western governments).The author does a good job of keeping his text non-specialist in its subject matter. Most readers will, I suspect, find that the is text overly repetitive in places, with many of the author's points being heavily laboured. That said, however, the book should prove an interesting read for anyone interested in knowing the ins and outs of why climate engineering is such an incredibly stupid idea, regardless of whether climate change is real, or even anthropogenic in nature. Anyone actually interested in finding an answer to the question posed in the book's title will, sadly, need to read more widely.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UMZZZOB1J4UK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745682065#wasThisHelpful","R1UMZZZOB1J4UK","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rock Jaw's ""Arcana V2"" in-ear headphones are a good pair of in-ear headphones with integral microphone for use with almost any of today's portable devices that require such. They are supplied with a total of four outer plastic buds, across a total of three different sizes overall, which should be a sufficiently wide range of fits to suit most purchasers. It is worth taking the time to fit the correct size buds for your ears, as this makes quite a difference to both the overall comfort levels as well as sound quality, especially with regard to the amount of audio pick-up and feedback from within the wearer's own head, as the headphones easily pick up and amplify breathing and swallowing sounds, for instance.  When used with the correct size buds, they are quite a comfortable fit, with fairly low levels of feedback.The manufacturers make much of the fact that these headphones are constructed from rosewood and aluminium, making them fairly robust but at the same time very lightweight, as well as richer in tone. I doubt whether most users will notice any significant difference from most all-metal or even plastic models, to be honest, except in a fairly small number of usage scenarios. Rock Jaw also claim that the twisted pair cables are less tangle prone than conventional multicore cables. Again, I can't say that I really noticed any improvement here over any other pair of headphones I've tried; they seemed to knit themselves into an impressive knot of Gordian proportions every time I looked away from them. They do seem to transmit a fair amount of handling and movement noise, however, which is a pity.Sonically, the 'phones appear to offer a nice flat frequency response, with good separation across the frequency range, working well to deliver a good clear soundfield from a wide range of listening sources. Those who like a heavyweight bass injected directly to brain may be a tad disappointed but personally I rather like the natural balance they deliver. Unlike many in-ear headphones these days, these do not offer any noise cancelling functionality; sonic purists will no doubt regard this as a good thing.My main gripes about the ""Arcana V2"" headphones are that the two earpieces are not labelled in any way to distinguish left from right; there are times when this matters and having to work out and remember which side has the microphone push-switch is a bit of a pain. Secondly, they are supplied without a carrying pouch or such-like. Instead, they some in a relatively large and flashy display case which consists principally of a heavy duty slip sleeve with a foam insert to hold the headphones, cable and the three unused pairs of outer plastic buds. This arrangement appears to be mostly about making the product look more professional than models distributed in standard blister-packaging. In reality, it offers nothing of use, merely lumbering you with a lot of extraneous packaging without providing any storage or carrying potential. (To be fair, though, it is a lot easier to get into than most blister packs!)All in all, these ""Arcana V2"" offers a fairly high quality of discrete mobile listening, albeit at a fairly high price. Much of the extra price seems to go towards supporting the manufacturers' hyped-up presentation of the product, rather than towards any tangible quality of the headphones themselves, although it has to be said that sonically they are far from disappointing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PKYAKVCA72F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OD2I562#wasThisHelpful","R2PKYAKVCA72F0","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Urry is Distinguished Professor of Sociology at Lancaster University in North West England. Not surprisingly, therefore, his latest book, ""Offshoring"", is an academically rigorous and thoroughly researched summary of the sociological as well as economic effects of the comparatively recent global phenomenon of 'offshoring' -- i.e. the circumventing of regulatory or legislative restrictions on particular activities by moving those activities overseas to some other location with laxer laws or more 'relaxed' attitudes.  Offshoring as a practice is not particularly new, but, as this book demonstrates, it has really flourished since the rise of financial neo-liberalism from the mid 1980s on.For most people, offshore business is most likely to be associated with the exploitation of cheap, non-unionised labour markets -- most commonly in the provision of customer service call-centres -- or in the burgeoning use of overseas tax havens.  It is clear from this book, however, that corporate tax avoidance and worker exploitation are but the tip of a huge iceberg of socially unacceptable or immoral outcomes of routine undertakings of the rich and the powerful. Such undertakings are invariably at the expense of the poor and less powerful and, as the author shows, ultimately indeed, of the very planet itself.For many, John Urry's book will be a truly eye-opening and frightening read. In it, he chronicles the entire gamut of activities that, while central to today's interconnected world, nevertheless escape crucial regulation for the common good by being undertaken in offshore localities. Such activities are usually conducted in secret, often hidden behind faÁades of respectability (which further prevent too much inspection from prying eyes) and invariably kept comfortably out of the sight of the masses and thus well and truly out of mind.The list is far longer and all-encompassing and the harm greater than you might think. Most commonly reported in the media these days and at least somewhat in the public spotlight is the routine offshoring of wealth and finance. This not only deprives societies generally of vast quantities of essential tax revenues but also leaves financial speculators free to gamble on money markets and other ephemera such as derivatives, rather than invest in real assets, and in the process risks bringing about complete global economic collapse. Similarly, offshoring of labour is known to damage workers' health and wellbeing in order to keep the richer parts of the world supplied with cheap consumer goods and services, the demand for which has been largely engineered by the offshoring businesses themselves.Less obviously open to offshoring, perhaps, but shown in this book to be no less significant in their impact are: - leisure activities, with overseas locations often sought as vacation destinations in order to legitimise otherwise illegal pleasure-seeking activities such as gambling, drug taking or sexual exploitation of (usually) women or children. - energy provision, with the reliance on oil and gas driving drilling operations into ever more inhospitable and risky environments, increasing the chances of irreparable damage to fragile and vital ecosystems - waste disposal, with ever increasing quantities of toxic and hazardous material discarded by rich consumers being shipped over the horizon, out of sight and out of mind, to pollute the lands and endanger of the lives of those make a living from processing the detritus of moden consumer-based living - transportation, with the need to transport cheaply the growing volumes of (offshored) manufactured goods, energy sources and discarded waste, filling the oceans' shipping lanes with dangerously substandard cargo vessels registered under flags of convenience, frequently imperilling the lives of poorly paid crews and risking ecological mishap - state security, with activities such as 'extraordinary rendition' supposedly legitimising the use of torture and other extreme means of extracting the knowledge supposedly required to separate friend from (often imaginary) 'enemy' -- often creating new, very real, enemies in the process.The final chapters of the book demonstrate the wider harm that offshoring in general perpetuates -- widening inequalities; squandering of vital resources; irreversible environmental impact; loss of democracy; undermining of global security and the sacrificing of real freedoms for the illusory freedoms of the relentless consumer. It builds a potent argument for a reversal of the offshoring process, suggesting some potential avenues which might bring this about. (Some may regard the book as a clarion call to revolution, a declaration that it is time to topple the powerful from their positions. To read it this way though is to miss one of its central tenets: that the powerful are already beyond the reach of revolution, except on a truly global scale, as their seats of power are themselves largely offshored, making them inherently unreachable by the masses.)The book is not without its faults: the author has a tendency towards repetition, which makes some sections a little tedious to read. I feel also that he takes the oceanic metaphor of offshoring a little too far (and I am not at all convinced of his assertion that 'salted away' is an original offshoring or sea-related expression either -- it doesn't mean 'hidden away' so much as 'preserved in case of need'.)  These faults are neither major nor serious, however, and need not deter any potential reader; its message is too important to disregard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38F5RP5GSJ23K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745664865#wasThisHelpful","R38F5RP5GSJ23K","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have not already encountered the deliciously raw and violent world of Daniel Polansky's Low Town and its laconic and somewhat nefarious Warden, then ""A Drink Before We Die: A Low Town Short"" serves as an excellent -- and clever -- introduction. This short story provides an intoxicating -- if gory -- vignette which perfectly encapsulates all that makes the Low Town trilogy (""Low Town: The Straight Razor Cure"", ""Tomorrow, the Killing"", and ""She Who Waits"") such an addictive read.For those already hooked, the timing of this release is perfect, delivering a much-needed fix whilst we wait for the author's next novel, ""Those Above (The Empty Throne)"", to hit the shelves. This Kindle-only release gives some appearance of being hurried to 'press' -- I spotted a couple of typos in it -- but at least no Daniel Polansky fan needs to suffer cold turkey this Christmas!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FKH9Y0M6AL6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RCK01R8#wasThisHelpful","R3FKH9Y0M6AL6W","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Mitchell's ""The Bone Clocks"" is like so many of this author's books -- mind-blowing in its complexity and dazzling in its genre-bending propensities.  Superficially, it has some similarities with the earlier ""Cloud Atlas"" in that its narrative is propelled through erratic leaps between multiple protagonists across large time gaps -- and with just as many seeming subject changes.  This latest book differs from its forerunner, however, in being simultaneously more tightly integrated in its storylines and more rambling in its delivery. It is also infinitely more convoluted (labyrinthine, even) in its formulation -- offering something of the literary equivalent of a Mandlebrot Set in the self-referential nature of its unfolding.In some regards, this latest book has more in common with ""The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet"". It not only reintroduces -- three times -- one of that book's characters but also shares its constant shifts of narrative direction and focus, possesses the same drawn-out perambulatory pacing, and concludes on a similar extended coda with little real relevance to the central story.Where this book deviates from either of its immediate stablemates, however, is in the depth of humour which pervades almost every sentence and yet in a way that remains forever veiled and subtextual rather than overtly stated. (I wonder how many readers, for instance, will even spot the joke embedded with the very title of the book's final section, which is not exposed until the story's closing twist.)For all of its brilliance -- and the fact that this is a book that is a consistently fun and at times very funny read -- there remained for me at least, a feeling that much of what the author attempts in this book has, in fact, been better delivered in works such as Nick Harkaway's ""Angelmaker"" or even Sheri S. Tepper's ""Beauty"". And, by and large, I found travelling to be considerably more rewarding than arrival at the book's eventual destination.  That said, the book remains very good indeed and well worth a read. It could well blow your mind!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZTVMO96T8R4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KG6L02A#wasThisHelpful","RZTVMO96T8R4L","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Philip Ziegler's biography of the father of Britain's current Queen Elizabeth, ""George VI: The Dutiful King"", is a slim addition to the 'Penguin Monarchs' series, offering just six chapters over fewer than 80 pages of a hardbound duodecimo format (approx 7"" x 5"") publication, sporting an odd three-quarter height dust sleeve.  In addition to a collection of photographs of the king at various stages of this life, the book also has an index, notes regarding source materials for each of the chapters, plus suggestions for further reading. The main text itself is an easy and undemanding read, offering a fairly comprehensive survey of the life and reign of Britain's last king.The book's size is probably commensurate with the biography of a monarch who reined for just 16 years and who didn't live beyond his 57th year. Nevertheless, one can't help feeling that it does little more than scrape the surface of its subject matter, for all that the author does his utmost to reassure his readers that George VI was in no way a deep or complicated man. Something about this book left me strangely unsatisfied, all the same.Another problem is that Philip Ziegler constantly assumes that his readers will be familiar with most of the book's additional cast and so provides them with no introduction and precious little gloss. Whilst it is perhaps a reasonable assumption that figures such as Winston Churchill and Neville Chamberlain need no such introduction, it may be asking a bit much for younger readers especially to know just who Herbert Morrison, Hugh Dalton or even Ernest Bevin might be.  The text can also be confusing at times, principally because of the things it fails to explain for those who are unaware of the complications of, for instance, the naming of royal personages. It is never made clear, for examnple, just why 'Prince Berty', as he is referred to throughout the book, should later be crowned as King George VI, or why 'his brother David' became (briefly) Edward VIII. Or what it means that Prince Philip of Greece ""had no name"".These minor faults and irritations notwithstanding, the book does a good job of dispelling many of the rumours and myths which have over the years surrounded George VI and his actions, setting the record straight once and for all regarding his attitudes both to various of his family members and to his duties and responsibilities in general. More than anything, the book does an excellent job of emphasising the sense of duty that George displayed throughout his life, and how important was the role he (and his wife) played in humanising the role of the Crown and securing a place for the monarchy in the hearts of the British public for generations afterwards.In short: an interesting, if not an exactly riveting read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KKC4LXSZSJQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014197737X#wasThisHelpful","R3KKC4LXSZSJQI","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Assassin's Blade"" is a collection of five ""prequel novellas"" (or, more accurately, advertising teasers) for Sarah J. Maas' teen romance/fantasy novel, ""Throne of Glass"". Four of the novellas (""The Assassin and the Pirate Lord"", ""The Assassin and the Desert"", ""The Assassin and the Underworld"" and ""The Assassin and the Empire"") were previously released in ebook form on the run-up to the release of the first novel of the main series. The entire collection is here available in a single binding, in both physical and ebook forms, joined by a newly written and otherwise unavailable fifth story, ""The Assassin and the Healer"" which sits, chronologically, as second in the new ordering.Together, these five short stories cover a relatively short period of Celaena Sardothien's life immediately prior to the events of the main ""Throne of Glass"" story, essentially chronicling the period of her ill-fated relationship with Sam Cortland.Established fans of this series of books will love this collection, as it provides lots of additional detail to the Celaena Sardothien's back-story and offers some tantalising hints as to how the main novels may yet develop in future. Anyone coming afresh to the stories and wondering whether to read the prequels first or not need not hesitate -- they give a great feel for the main novels and give away no surprises, but neither are they required reading for a better understanding of the other books, so it doesn't matter at all which order you plump for.All five stories here are very short; each can easily be read in an evening or less. The writing quality does vary across the series, suggesting that they've actually been written either at speed or over a collection of different times. The newcomer to the set, ""The Assassin and the Healer"", whilst the shortest is also the best written of them all, showing a maturity of writing style that is sadly missing from the others. It has clearly been added to give this new omnibus addition some additional content over and above the previously released material (a move that may annoy those fans who bought the four other stories separately long ago but who now feel that they have to fork out again to acquire the new tale). It adds little the events already chronicled in the earlier stories but is, in fact, worth having as it paints an interesting vignette of a single short episode which nevertheless adds volumes to the complexity of the character of the Assassin of Adarlan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PY0980UARW8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1408851989#wasThisHelpful","R3PY0980UARW8I","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Assassin and the Empire"" concludes the series of ""prequel novellas"" (or, more accurately, pre-release advertising teasers) for Sarah J. Maas' teen romance/fantasy novel, ""Throne of Glass"". It neatly wraps up all of the prequel threads and also sets things up perfectly for the opening of the main novel.Anyone who has already read the main novel will be fully aware of the outcomes and events which unfold here and it is to the author's credit that she does nothing to string things out or attempt any surprises along the way. Instead, she cranks up the tension by having events roll steadily and relentlessly towards their inexorable conclusion, making this easily the most gripping of the prequel stories.Established fans will love this story, as it provides lots of additional detail to the Celaena Sardothien's back-story and provides some tantalising hints as to how the main novels may yet develop in future. Anyone coming afresh to the stories by reading the prequels first will not be disappointed here, either.  It cannot, of course, really be recommended on its own, needing the reader to be familiar with the earlier novellas (""The Assassin and the Pirate Lord"", ""The Assassin and the Desert"" and ""The Assassin and the Underworld"" all being heavily referenced.)Since the release of the omnibus edition of all five 'Throne of Glass' novellas, ""The Assassin's Blade"", it has become pointless buying each of the stories separately -- especially as the second tale in the prequel sequence, ""The Assassin and the Healer"", is only available as part of the omnibus collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IB7HA9T0JHEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NA1A4E#wasThisHelpful","R2IB7HA9T0JHEQ","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Assassin and the Underworld"" is the penultimate of five ""prequel novellas"" (or, more accurately, pre-release advertising teasers) for Sarah J. Maas' teen romance/fantasy novel, ""Throne of Glass"", following straight on from  ""The Assassin and the Desert"".In it, we see Celaena Sardothien revert to her usual role of vain and pampered spoilt brat, more concerned about her split ends and smudges to her make-up, and living it up at all-night parties than she is about living up to her position as Assassin of Adarlan. In short, this particular novella reverts to the normal form of at least the first two volumes of the main series, ""Throne of Glass"" and ""Crown of Midnight"", by being principally a teen romance placed within a fantasy setting,  aimed pretty much at a female teenager market.  As such, it gives a good feel for the main novels (and provides some additional more-of-the-same reading for fans who have consumed those and who still want more) and also supplies additional background detail for the main story.Fans of the main series should not be too disappointed adding this to their collection (especially those keen to know more about Celaena's and Sam's relationship). The biggest disappointment will probably be its length -- the book is only about 70 pages long. Be aware too, that this particular novella cannot really be recommended on its own, being very much a continuation of the story told in earlier ones, so if you are at all interested, you would be well advised to buy the omnibus edition of all of the 'Throne of Glass' novellas, ""The Assassin's Blade"", rather than acquire each of the stories separately (especially as that way you get an overwise unavailable 'bonus' fifth novella, ""The Assassin and the Healer"" included too).In summary, this is a 'must-have' addition to the collection of the established fan; anyone just wanting a taster of these books is advised to sample ""The Assassin and the Pirate Lord"" first of all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQPDD3W4C2LL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Z4SBZA#wasThisHelpful","RQPDD3W4C2LL5","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Assassin and the Desert"" is the third of five ""prequel novellas"" (or, more accurately, pre-release advertising teasers) for Sarah J. Maas' teen romance/fantasy novel, ""Throne of Glass"". (It was originally published as the second, to follow on from ""The Assassin and the Pirate Lord""; the collected omnibus edition of the novellas, ""The Assassin's Blade"", inserts a new additional story, ""The Assassin and the Healer"", between these two.)This story is much better conceived and executed than its predecessor, with fewer sillinesses and a more believable, slightly less stereotyped array of characters. It is also very slightly longer, but not by much. Like ""The Assassin and the Pirate Lord"", it offers newcomers a reasonable opportunity to determine what the Celaena Sardothien books are all about and whether they hold anything of interest for little investment in either time or money. That said, a would-be reader would be well advised to come to this story via its forerunner(s), rather than starting here.Anyone who has already consumed all of the books of the main series published so far, only to find themselves hungry for more will, naturally, have to have this story too -- it does flesh out some of the events hinted at in the main series without spoiling any aspects of the main tale -- and would be well advised to buy the omnibus publication, rather than acquire each of the novellas separately.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GUPNI7T9OAYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007N3HEWY#wasThisHelpful","R1GUPNI7T9OAYC","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Assassin and the Pirate Lord"" is the first of five ""prequel novellas"" (or, more accurately, pre-release advertising teasers) for Sarah J. Maas' teen romance/fantasy novel, ""Throne of Glass"".The book is even more silly and cliched than the main novel it serves to advertise, featuring no originality whatsoever and with many utterly absurd notions that a publisher more interested in quality than in advertising copy would probably have worked harder to remove prior to publication. In addition, the story suffers from a distinct lack of polish in the plot department, with some quite needless and -- with never being explained -- entirely confusing twists at the beginning which are presumably designed to serve as intriguing hooks but which sadly are then abandoned altogether.Readers who already know and love Celaena Sardothien will, of course, not care a fig for these shortcoming, because even within this book's small compass (it contains only about an hour's worth of reading) it nevertheless manages to convey to perfection the character of the irritating head-strong teenage heroine of the Throne of Glass series. It also provides the very mix of kick-ass action and hesitant teen romance that pretty much defines ""Throne of Glass"".This book serves two functions ideally, then. Firstly it offers newcomers a good way to find out whether or not these books are for them, requiring little investment in either time or money. Secondly, it offers some more-of-the-same reading matter for anyone who has consumed all of the books of the main series published to date only to find themselves hungry for more.  It doesn't provide a great deal more, but existing fans should not be disappointed with the contents.When first published, the next novella in the prequel sequence was ""The Assassin and the Desert"". A new bound-edition print collection of the series, ""The Assassin's Blade"", features an additional story, ""The Assassin and the Healer"", between these two. This new addition to the sequence has not been released separately.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PM4K0J5RRNI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007E6PN3M#wasThisHelpful","R3PM4K0J5RRNI2","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Isla Morley's latest novel, ""Above"", is ostensibly a teenage abduction thriller. Gradually, though, and almost imperceptibly, the book turns into something so much more, as it delves deeper into the value of hope and purpose, the dangers of obsession, the delicate balance between the two extremes. By the time it reaches its second half, the book is much more about humanity, about individuality and identity, and about freedom and just how illusory that can be in reality.The story is not an easy one to read -- at least psychologically -- but it is an almost impossible one to draw away from. Presented in the first person, the narrative is beautifully written using a unique voice that weaves the teenage and the naive with something ancient and wise in a way that constantly gives pause for thought whilst simultaneously maintaining credence and building empathy with the protagonist, Blythe, and her plight as an abductee held captive by a survivalist fanatic in an abandoned underground missile silo.  Each chapter is long, with sections that are discontinuous and are somehow disjointed and make the reader every bit as lost and disoriented temporarily as the protagonist. The narrative soon takes on an almost surreal floating timeless feel to it. It is also claustrophobic as well as tense and suspenseful.  Time and again, the tale twists in unexpected and unforeseen ways, causing the reader to surrender to the same emotional roller coaster ride as the protagonist.Ultimately, though, this is a book that makes it clear that the world is nothing like as black and white as we'd have ourselves believe it to be. It is a book that shows that the division between good actions and bad actions is nowhere near as clearcut as we think. It is a book that calls into question just what the word ""freedom"" means, and why it is important to us, as humans, and just how much we will pay, one way or another, to attain it. Above all, however, it is a book that explores what it is to be human and what it is that anchors us to that humanity when faced with ordeals and adversity.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQJ44SGS6T03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IECJIWM#wasThisHelpful","RKQJ44SGS6T03","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Visitors"" is Rebecca Mascull's d√©but novel. And a real stunner it is, too. It should also come with a warning: it is 19 chapters long; I would advise you to have at least 3 tissues handy for each!Part tale of personal survival, part love story, part something so much more, the book presents as a period piece, set at the start of cusp of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is  told from the first person perspective of a young girl deaf and blind from an early age. It is emotionally charged and highly personal in its detail, with a prose style that is both sensitive and moving, yet epic in scope. The story speaks with a power that is simply overwhelming in its consistent and consistently up-lifting honesty, optimism and generosity. Once started, it is extremely hard to put down.Beyond that, I am not prepared to comment, simply because much of the beauty of this book lies in the surprises that the author manages to deliver on almost every new page -- surprises both large and small that are an utter delight when they occur and which repeatedly make the eyes water up and have you reaching for yet another tissue!In short, books as beautiful as this are few and far between.

"It is easy for those wo didn't live through those times to look back over the war-torn first half of the twentieth century and to think that world peace was restored with the ending of the second of those World Wars. Victor Sebestyen's new book, ""1946: The Making of the Modern World"", quickly puts the lie to any such view, as well as any other cosy notion that global suffering and hardship at the hands of oppressive, invading regimes, somehow came to an end with the defeat of the Axis powers in the west, and the Japanese military machine in the east in 1945.  The book presents an overview, in more or less chronological order, of the key events of 1946, demonstrating how each of the decisions taken by the Second World War's ""victors"" in that year were to lead to the changes and events that have pretty much shaped the world ever since and which continue to impact on world peace and security to this day. Along the way, the book does a pretty good job of demonstrating the proof of Winston Churchill's famous words: ""Those who can win a war well can rarely make a good peace and those who could make a good peace would never have won the war.""The book necessarily has to review historical events and circumstances leading up to the year under review in order for readers to undestand and appreciate their context and background. In doing this, it reveals the various power balances that were in play, showing how the Second World War was largely responsible for shifting global economic power into the hands of the United States (as virtually the only country in the world to emerge from the war actually richer as a consequence of the war) and the necessary responses that other countries had to make to their altered global positions in that power struggle. Specifically, the book identifies 1946 as being the year in which many of the first steps were taken towards events which affected the world for most of the rest of the century and, indeed, continue to affect us today: the rise of the Eastern Bloc, foreshadowing the fall of the Iron Curtain and the ensuing East/West Cold War; the demilitarisation of Japan; the partitioning of India; the division of Palestine; civil war in Greece (and many other places); the threat of war with the USSR over Turkey; the ascendancy of Communism under Mao Zedong in China; the uneven and carefully orchestrated prosecution of war criminals. Above all, the book shows that the world in some ways was an even worse place in the immediate post-War years, with levels of human suffering and misery even higher than it had been throughout the war. Food shortages were worse; numbers of refugees and displaced persons at their highest ever and, with war reprisals all too rife, irrational and  mindless acts of barbarism between peoples quite possibly at their darkest.The author brings his full journalistic skills to the fore in presenting an extensive and exhaustive body of research into the events of the time, making the book an easy -- if highly depressing -- read for expert and lay reader alike. The author's sense of 'story' ensures that the book is never dense or plodding; indeed, at times, it reads almost as a thriller. Happily, though, the author manages to avoid overstating or over-dramatising matters and stays short of  sensationalising the facts. The book thus successfully navigates most of the pit-falls associated with popularising history texts.For the reader who wishes to dive deeper into the research, the author's sources are extensively referenced. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32K4DMPGAZ20K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0230758002#wasThisHelpful","R32K4DMPGAZ20K","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hornby have been making model railway sets in one guise or another since the appearance of Hornby Dublo in 1938; their ""OO"" gauge has pretty much been the de facto UK model railway standard ever since. The fact that the company is still very much in business is testimony to the quality and attention to detail of its products. And while some old-timers may tell you that its modern-day plastic moulded locomotives are not as sturdy not as pleasing in the hand as their earlier die-cast metal models, they are still very good reproductions of actual UK locos, with good attention to authenticity of detail.The ""R1138 GWR Passenger Freight"" electric train set is a nice little starter set, comprising a compact oval of track with a short length of siding, a GWR tank loco, with two goods wagons and a passenger coach, together with controller and printed cardboard mat on which the circuit can be laid out.  The set is small enough to be quickly assembled and put away again after use for occasional play and the components are robust enough to stand up to this too, provided they are not handled too roughly.The real enthusiast will, of course, prefer to install the set into a more permanent layout, most likely as nothing more than the kernel from which a much larger set-up will gradually (and never-endingly) grow!This set is an ideal way to find out how interested someone might be in playing with train sets generally without investing in a large layout. Be warned however that, like buying someone their first Lego set, this may end up by only being the start of a much larger undertaking!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AP9SU3X48QFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZL6976#wasThisHelpful","R1AP9SU3X48QFC","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""NTF3000 No Touch Plus Forehead Digital Thermometer"" from Braun is an excellent digital thermometer designed for measuring core body temperature in an entirely non-intrusive manner, making it ideal for use wherever there is a range of different potential patients -- such as in the family home.  It is as simple to use as it is safe and hygienic: simply place the device on or close to the patient's forehead and press a button. A clear and easily read LCD display then displays the temperature reading, helpfully colour coded to show whether the value is regarded as ""normal"", ""elevated"" or ""high"". The device can be configured to display either Celsius or Fahrenheit values by means of a slide switch tucked away in the battery compartment, which is handy for those who still prefer to think in old money when comes to some things. In normal operation, the thermometer will also beep to confirm its operation; this can conveniently be muted for those situations where this would be undesirable -- where you wouldn't want to wake a sleeping patient, for instance.There are a few simple guidelines that should be followed for best results -- ensure that the patient has been indoors long enough for any outdoor cooling effects to have been overcome; ensure that the forehead is not covered by hair or beaded with sweat; take care to use the area between the eyebrows; and so on. The device includes a proximity sensor which will prevent it from taking a reading if it is held too far from the subject. An error indicator shows when a reading suggests that the device has not been used properly -- if the reading is too low, for instance -- which reduces the potential for potentially dangerous (or frightening!) erroneous readings being taken. (Whilst a desirable feature for the device's intended use, this does, of course, limit its potential for wider non-medical temperature sensing jobs -- probably a good thing as it deters anyone from trying and ending up confused, or worse, by the results, as the device doesn't report the actual temperature it senses but rather computes a theoretical core body temperature from that value.)My only real criticism of the design concerns the dust cap that covers the sensor when not in use, which is a very tricky push fit, with a considerable reluctance to stay in place. I can see most people dispensing with or losing this item altogether very early on in the lifetime of the device. Hopefully, this won't matter too much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OJ7PMCRUVCXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTWTUKM#wasThisHelpful","R1OJ7PMCRUVCXB","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Emergen-C's ""Energy Release and Immunity Support"" food supplement is a high dose (1000mg) Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid) plus multi-vitamin and mineral product. It is supplied in boxes of single-dose sachets of powder which rapidly dissolves in water to produce an orange-flavoured daily health drink, designed to give you a daily energy and vitamin boost.The product offers a dose of vitamins well in excess of the recommended daily amounts (Vitamins: C - 1250%; B1 - 136%; B2 - 121%; B6 - 429%; B12 - 720%; D - 200%) as well as fair top-up of minerals Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Manganese, Chromium and Zinc (the Calcium and Zinc being particularly important as mineral accompaniments to Ascorbic acid). It is flavoured with natural orange and lemon extract and coloured with additional E162 (Betanin, aka Beetroot Red) natural food dye. So far, so good.Where the product falls down in the health-giving stakes is in its massive sugar content: it contains large amounts of fructose, cane sugar and maltodextrin as sweeteners -- which explains the product's ""energy boosting"" claims. It also contains bovine gelatine as an entirely superfluous ingredient which immediately renders it unsuitable for vegetarians or vegans.  Be aware too that some people suffer reactions to Ascorbic acid in the form of swelling to the face, water retention or digestive disorders; no warnings about these potential (but uncommon) side effects are given on the packaging of this product.For those wanting a short-term high dose blast of Vitamin C and a general immune system boost to face down an impending winter cold, these powders are probably OK. To avoid the sugar they contain, though, it is probably better to opt for ""Redoxon Double Action"" effervescent tablets instead, especially as these also offer a higher Zinc content (although these use Aspartame as the sweetener instead, which comes with its own problems). They do lack the additional vitamins, but it's probably also better to tailor vitamin and mineral supplementation to your diet and lifestyle than to take a single multi-mix. You might also wish to bear in mind that unless your immune system is taking a hit owing to an underlying health issue, it is generally regarded as undesirable to take regular large doses of Vitamin C over prolonged periods; they should be avoided altogether by anyone suffering from renal problems.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A5PHS54ZP91U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00016RL9G#wasThisHelpful","R1A5PHS54ZP91U","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a mediocre start to this series with ""Throne of Glass"", Sarah J. Maas has managed to build on the improvements delivered in ""Crown of Midnight"", with a very solid continuation of the tale in this third part of the saga, ""Heir of Fire"". The greater complexities to the storyline which were hinted at in the earlier volume are now much more fully exposed and developed, with the slowness of the earlier parts now fully revealed as but the beginning a long-form narrative piece that clearly still has some distance to run.Additionally, the writing and the drama have both tightened up considerably in this volume, the author having now very much matured in her story-telling skills, especially with regard to timing and tension. This latest volume has a more complex story line than either of the earlier books, with the author here splitting the action between some four or five story strands. The emphasis has also moved away from the teen romance elements of the earlier books, focusing instead much more on drama and action. Those who liked the romance aspect of the earlier volumes need not worry however, as it has not been dropped entirely.Sadly, the subject matter and the ideas remain every bit as derivative as the earlier books, with absolutely nothing new being brought to the fantasy canon here. That said, the author has at least developed a credible and consist synthesis of well established fantasy elements and lovers of the genre should be more than happy with the result -- there is nothing that leaps off the page as being wrong and much that is very right indeed. And what the book lacks in originality is partly made up for in sheer epic scale and scope of the vision behind it.Plot-wise, whilst many of the outcomes are predictable, especially with regard to the main Celaena thread, the routes to those outcomes often are not. Nor is at all obvious where many of the longer arcs of the narrative are heading. If the book has a real fault it is the continuing overly angst- and guilt-ridden nature of the heroine which is even more over-done in this volume than it was in the last one. The addition of a host of substantial new characters -- including a loveable baddy -- as well as some unexpected new elements to the story line does much to break up any ""more of the same"" feel that the book would otherwise have.In summary, then, ""Heir of Fire"" offers a rock-solid continuation of the ""Throne of Glass"" saga, albeit one which effectively serves notice on the reader that there is still a long way to go yet before this story completes. For most readers, I would expect that to be good news, not bad.  The ending will also leave you eager for the release of the next part of the tale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJF2MAPOF2IO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGAD0N4#wasThisHelpful","RJF2MAPOF2IO7","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Sort Your Brain Out"" by motivational speaker, Adrian Webster, and neuroscientist, Dr Jack Lewis, is not so much a self-help book as it is a lay person's guide to understanding the functioning of the brain, with hints and tips for keeping that organ healthy and properly operational. As such, the book falls somewhat between stools; being more instructive than instructional, the reader is very much left to their own devices to take away from the book whatever they can find there and so to work out (or not) ways in which to make use of that. For some, this approach will make a welcome change from the overly prescriptive self-help style of book which promises miraculous improvement to well-being simply by rigorously following a fully articulated (and mostly totally impractical) n-point plan. Rather than adopt that approach, the authors here present their readers with the neuroscience (in a simple and easily digested form) which underlies various key aspects of what the brain does and how, followed by some pointers as to how to keep each of those functions optimised.The danger of this approach is that it is all too easy to read the book and to end up feeling that all it does is to offer common sense, dressed up with a lot of technical detail that is of little or no import to anyone not studying for a neuroscience qualification. The book can also feel pretty thin on content with no obvious logic to its structure.Whether or not this book actually does help you to sort out your brain, you should find that it is, at least, an easy and fairly relaxed read, at the end of which you should be fully equipped to boost your performance, manage stress and generally achieve more in life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R349SDFWXF6SR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857085379#wasThisHelpful","R349SDFWXF6SR4","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having pretty much closed off all scope for any further contemporary Erlendur stories with ""Strange Shores"" in 2010, it is interesting to see that Icelandic novelist, Arnaldur Indriason, has been unable to stay away from the characters he invented for his 'Reykjav√≠k Murder Mysteries' series for long. The first sign that there may indeed be more Erlendur stories in the offing appeared in 2011 with the release in Icelandic of a prequel story featuring the detective's former CID mentor Marion Briem, ""Einv√≠gi√∞ (The Match)"", set in Reykjavik during the World Chess Championship between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky in summer 1972. Then, in 2012, another prequel story, ""Reykjav√≠kurn√¶tur (Reykjav√≠k Nights)"", appeared, this time featuring Erlendur himself as a young rooky traffic cop working the night shifts in Reykjav√≠k (and playing sleuthe during his time off) in the summer of 1974, on the run up to the national festival at √ûingvellir to celebrate the 1100th anniversary of the settlement of Iceland.  Sadly, we are still waiting for a publisher to take up the English language option for the first of these two prequel stories, but the second is now available as ""Reykjav√≠k Nights"", in an excellent translation by Victoria Cribb.In many ways, ""Reykjav√≠k Nights"" is Arnaldur Indri√∞ason's best book yet: his minimalist prose are here at their leanest and his own unique style of brutalist realism honed to perfection. The 1974 setting provides the author with an opportunity to present an aspect of Reykjav√≠k that English readers will not have encountered in his books before. The author paints a fascinating and highly evocative picture of a Reykjav√≠k that is pretty much long gone but whose shadows still linger in the city today, and of a nation just starting to be influenced by increased access to foreign travel, TV, etc. As ever, Erlendur represents the traditionalist all at sea in the rising tide of modernism -- and, also as usual, the face of human caring in a world increasingly enslaved by capitalism and commercialism.  Like many of the other stories in the 'Reykjavik Murder Mysteries' series, this book also points up how fragile life can be and how narrow the divide between success and disaster; how little needs to occur for a life to go wrong.The story unfolds slowly at first but is cleverly constructed, its direction never obvious nor its outcomes certain. There are also some clever ties into earlier (or later, depending on how you reckon these things) Erlendur stories  (especially ""Jar City""), for those able to spot them.For me, this book feels to be a rewarding outgrowth from the earlier books; it does not appear to have been written in any way as an afterthought but very much delivers new insight into Erlendur's character and behaviours in the events that occur later in his life. I would not recommend the book to those who have yet to read the main series, because I think much of the beauty and many of the delights of this book rely on the reader having knowledge of events that occur and characters that appear in later times. This volume also potentially gives away some of the surprises of the other books; essentially, the book reads best as the tenth in the sequence (for English-language readers), not as the first.For those who have read the other Erlendur stories, this provides an excellent addition to the canon. Let's just hope that somebody soon sees sense and adds ""The Match"" to the collection too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TQVRYF3SWUKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L57BHIG#wasThisHelpful","R1TQVRYF3SWUKX","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the sequel to ""Throne of Glass"" by Sarah J. Maas, ""Crown of Midnight"" continues the story of Celaena Sardothien, erstwhile Assassin of Adarlen and now newly appointed King's Champion. The action picks up straight from the earlier volume, with the author assuming pretty much throughout that her readers will be familiar with the story so far.This second volume is a great improvement on the earlier one, having plenty of exciting action, as well as packing in lots some unexpected plot twists along the way. In addition, the earlier book's sorry lack of character development has been rectified, with much more believable and well-rounded portrayals of the principles as well as additional supporting members of the cast.The book is not without its silly moments and stolen ideas (plus the author remains pretty inept at inventing credible character names) but these flaws can be easily overlooked, because by and large the plot development is kept tight and free flowing. At heart, the story remains as much a romance as it does a fantasy romp but the mix is much better balanced than in the earlier tale. The author delivers here an altogether more mature story-telling style but one which should nevertheless appeal to its primary audience of late-teenage/young adult readers every bit as much. Certainly anyone who enjoyed the first volume will love this.The book nicely sets up the third part of Celaena's story, ""Heir of Fire"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OEIZBXK5HP4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619630648#wasThisHelpful","R1OEIZBXK5HP4X","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Throne of Glass"" is the much vaunted d√©but novel by Sarah J. Maas. The publishers make much of the fact that the story has had a ten-year gestation period since the author shared its first draft with the world on FictionPress.com.  It is disappointing, then, that for all its honing, the book still reads as though it was written not only for teenagers but also by one. For while the author may have matured her writing style and narrative structures to the point where these cannot really be faulted, the book still retains one glaring feature of story-telling immaturity: a complete absence of understanding of her purported core subject matter. For all that this book purports to be an action fantasy novel about a teenage assassin with a ""heart of ice and will of steel"", the sad fact is that it is actually a plodding courtly romance, featuring an undisciplined, blushing teenager, with a great interest in eating candy, wearing posh frocks, attending parties and staying up all night reading romantic stories than in actually achieving the freedom she supposedly aspires to above all else.Throughout the book, the author fails to demonstrate that she has the slightest understanding of what would be involved in becoming the sort of character that her heroine is supposed to be. The author's desire to invent a character with whom her target audience can identify means that she portrays a teenage bookworm, concerned first and foremost with how she is perceived by the young men she encounters who -- naturally -- has some kick-ass abilities which they cannot immediately see. In short, the book presents some romantic sanitised Disney notion of ""assassin"", rather than any realistic portrayal of what the word means and entails.Characterisations are also generally poor throughout the book, everyone being both two-dimensional and unconvincing, with the author endlessly resorting to stereotypes. In addition, many of the fundamental premises upon which the story rests are both contrived and naive: the notion that an elimination competition to establish a King's Champion should be strictly non-lethal in both formulation and operation is hard to accept, at best; the idea that the Captain of the Royal Guard of a household as violent and blood-thirsty as that of the house of Adarlan should himself be a complete stranger to killing, is little short of ludicrous.In summary, this book is really nothing more than a soppy teen romance placed within a setting of action fantasy, almost all elements of which are highly derivative and lacking in originality. I would not expect the book's younger target audience to be disappointed at this and for many this will be exactly what they require. Anyone seeking a fantasy adventure story for preference, however, risks disappointment and would do well to avoid this book.A sequel, ""Crown of Midnight"", is also available.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R97B30HRV2K0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619630346#wasThisHelpful","R97B30HRV2K0R","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""My Soul To Take"" is the second volume in Yrsa Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir's series of 'Th√≥ra Gudmundsd√≥ttir murder mysteries'. The original was first published in Icelandic as ""S√©r grefur gr√∂f (Digging their own grave)"" in 2006; this English translation, begun by Bernard Scudder and completed by Anna Yates, following the former's untimely death, appeared in 2009.Stylistically, the book is more consistent than its predecessor, ""Last Rituals"", offering a fairly standard who-dunnit murder mystery, with a nice touch of dark supernatural undercurrents to counterpoint the book's fluffy chick-lit overtones. The action for this volume is entirely within Iceland's western peninsula of Sn√¶fellsnes, although an entirely fictional one of the author's own invention -- at least one hopes that the vague resemblance of the book's setting to B√∫√∞ir, with its modern hotel and striking black church, is entirely coincidental -- with some interesting historical references thrown in for good measure.  Thora's family situation manages to impose itself less on the story than it did in the previous volume, although still features to some extent, so that those interested in the on-going soap opera can be kept up to date with developments.As with the earlier book, readers looking for anything of the minimalist ultra-realism of Iceland's other notable crime writer, Arnaldur Indri√∞ason (""Jar City"" etc) will undoubtedly find this story overly fanciful and unrealistic. Anyone simply looking for an engaging (but fundamentally formulaic) murder mystery set in an unfamiliar and unusual setting will undoubtedly love it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LXBRT1Y1B5K7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003LPV104#wasThisHelpful","R2LXBRT1Y1B5K7","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jim Taihuttu's film ""Wolf"" is a  strange animal. Mostly dressed in the clothes of its forerunners, it tries to be the Netherlands' answer to ""Raging Bull"" (even being shot in B&W) but instead ends up as a mish-mash of derivative elements from just about every immigrant misfit/gangster/boxer movie ever made. Whilst individual performances are strong, with Marwen Kenzari's lead character (Majid) very convincing indeed, the hackneyed unfolding of events and the very predictability of Majid's downward spiral of self-destructiveness ultimately rob the film of much of its merit.  Even the monochrome production feels like a mis-judgement, somehow smoothing over the very grit that I suspect it was intended to enhance.The film is in a mix of languages, but principally Dutch with English subtitles, from which I could not help but think that a lot has gone missing in translation.Overall, this film is hard to recommend unless you are really stuck for something to watch and you enjoy the sight of people out of control.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QD6TVLYA3Y9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L22H45O#wasThisHelpful","R2QD6TVLYA3Y9N","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I do wish that when American authors set their novels in Victorian London that they would undertake at least some basic research beforehand into the nature of Victorian British society -- its class strata, its undercurrents and its real life events --  rather than just assembling a collection of quirky period objects placed in historical settings, populated with stock Hollywood caricatures dressed in music-hall costumes, acting out the same time-honoured but entirely fictitious American version of what might have been.  Alex Grecian's so-called murder mystery, ""The Yard"", featuring Scotland Yard's ""murder squad"" (the CID never get a mention) in the immediate aftermath of the Whitehall (""Jack the Ripper"") Murders should serve a classic warning to all as to why this territory should be declared off-limits to American authors until they have learnt to study their subject a little deeper.Alex Grecian gives every impression of having tried. He imbues his story with countless little extra details that no doubt took many hours of research to unearth. Sadly, every single one is wasted, because they are invariably either wrong, or else placed in such an incongruous setting as to indicate all too plainly that the author has no basic understanding whatsoever of how different Britain is from America.  And for each detail that he includes, he omits or gets wrong at least ten far more important ones alongside it.Yes, Colonel Sir Edward Bradford was indeed Commissioner of Police, was universally admired by the men who served under him and did much to improve both the organisation and conditions of work within the Metropolitan Police. Unfortunately, he did not receive this Commission until June 1890, more than a year after the date in which the author so meticulously positions his story. Ironically, by the time Sir Edward was in office, the Metropolitan Police had all but removed from Four Whitehall Place (Great Scotland Yard)  -- the setting for ""The Yard"" -- and were operating from their ""New"" Scotland Yard premises on Victoria Embankment. And while Alex Grecian goes to some length to explain to his readers how Sir Edward came to lose an arm tiger-hunting in India, and is at pains to remind us of this deficiency whenever Sir Edward appears in the book, he himself seems never to realise that such a loss would, by its every nature, prevent this character from ""steepling"" or ""interlocking"" his fingers, as he frequently is described as doing during exchanges with his detectives.As the very epitome of the English gentleman, there is also absolutely no way Sir Edward would ever utter phrases so entirely American in nature as ""use the room in back"" or ""different than"" -- a fault that similarly applies to almost all dialogue throughout the book. Much of the book's dialogue attempts to sound period but fails owing to a lack of appreciation by the author that the very subject matter under discussion would be incomprehensible to the Victorian mind; many of the concepts (""closure"" for instance) are entirely contemporary in nature.  The narrative too is splattered with words that have little or no meaning within an English context; wherever there is an American alternative for an English word, it is used instead, so that we have panhandlers, rather than beggars, shears instead of scissors, nightstick for truncheon, barkeeps where we should have landlords, beat cops in preference to Bobbies, and mention of the first floor as an incorrect (in British usage) and therefore confusing reference to the ground floor, and so on.  Whilst some of this could be put down to an over-zealous editor worried that too many truly English words and phrases would render the book too difficult for an American audience (I do think editors do their readership a disservice at times), blame for the book's other fault of transplanting American modes of thinking and preferences into the British characters' actions and behaviours can lie only with the author. In doing this, he renders almost every character in the book anachronistic in everything they say and do, from the small details of supplying office colleagues with a breakfast of tarts (that would be bacon butties, surely?) to the larger ones of Bobbies feeling able (or being allowed) to freely mingling with Inspectors at all.  On top of this there sits an over-riding impression of ignorance on the part of the author of many basic everyday details (all so well known to a British readership) -- that British Bobbies of the period wore helmets, not hats; that they carried their truncheons in a special side pocket of their trousers, not looped onto their belt; that detectives did not routinely carry firearms (and that if they did they would not be Colt revolvers); that the social classes did not intermingle in any way and that strict protocols were in force to keep it that way -- which completely undermines any authority the book might be attempting to bring to anything it says.All of which is a great shame, because Alex Grecian's story actually has the makings of a classic ripping yarn of the ""Boys' Own"" ilk, with (largely) likeable characters doing ""the decent thing"" whilst pitted against some of the very dregs of humanity.  As a comic book story, told in words rather than pictures, ""The Yard"" is really excellent and if judged on those terms works very well indeed -- each chapter presenting a classic comic book panel, painstakingly illustrated in graphic detail and punchy dialogue, kept to the point.  As an historical novel this book is a complete disaster but as a comic book romp (albeit a wordy one) it makes an excellent penny dreadful!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R343PQ1ABPRI2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425261271#wasThisHelpful","R343PQ1ABPRI2U","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Hypothernia"" is the sixth of Arnaldur Indriason's series of 'Reykjavik Murder Mysteries' to be translated into English. The original Icelandic novel, ""Har√∞skafi"" (whose meaning is unclear, but which might be rendered as 'Slim Pickings')"", was published in 2007 as the eight book in the series. (For various reasons, the first two volumes have never been -- and are unlikely ever to be -- made available in translation.) This 2010 English rendition is by Victoria Cribb, and provides a characteristically idiomatic translation of the author's original sparse, almost minimalist Icelandic prose.This volume in the series has Inspector Erlendur well and truly off piste, as he whittles away relentlessly at a number of seemingly unrelated mysteries, none of which give any indication of having a crime behind them, with not only the reader but his own colleagues at Police Headquarters wondering just what he is up to throughout much of the book.  With Sigurdur √ìli and El√≠nborg barely making an appearance in this book, this is very much a story about Erlendur more than anything or anyone else -- it is a story centred on obsession as well as depression and melancholia. As the book progresses, Erlendur increasingly seems to be cutting himself off from events of the present and dwelling increasingly in happenings of the past, while the story generally lingers far more around matters spiritual and supernatural that one normally expects in this series.Unusually for books in this series, this volume features a glimpse of Iceland beyond the streets of Reykjavik and takes in a number of locations on the tourist map; as a consequence, those readers who have visited Iceland may more easily relate to the settings of this book than to some others in the series. Also unusually, the more Erlendur digs, the more of his mystery pieces start dropping into place together, making this by far the most interconnected and intriguing of Arnaldur's stories so far. In keeping with the book's all-pervading feel of gloom, however, the ending -- whilst well-delivered and fitting -- has of it something of gently understated tragedy. It also hints that in at least one regard, not all of the outcomes have yet been revealed and something weighty may be being saved for a future volume.For all of its doom and gloom, this book is gripping and engaging throughout. It makes for a cracking read, once you are used to Arnaldur's sometimes idiosyncratic prose style, with his plot construction maturing very nicely indeed here.  Although the book has few dependencies on preceding volumes in series, it is very hard to recommend this volume in isolation, as it makes much more sense taken as part of the series in which it sits.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LSGJ16EPARIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031RS858#wasThisHelpful","R3LSGJ16EPARIP","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Right from the opening, you just know that Michael Lander's 2010 American psychological thriller, ""Peacock"" isn't going to end well. The only question really is just how badly awry things are going to go before the conclusion, for the film's main protagonist, John Skillpa -- a quiet 20-something bank clerk living alone in tiny Peacock, Nebraska, and a sufferer from Dissociative Identity Disorder.  A short way into this film, I started to wonder also if the writers hadn't actually overdone the while DID thing, as the story-line itself starts to exhibit similar symptoms, with the film not really sure what it is, or where it is going.  With more twists than a Mandelbrot set and enough tension to keep you wound up for weeks afterwards, the film is a gripping yet perplexing watch.  In the final analysis, though, I think that ultimately this film is a brave and audacious attempt at something different, which just fails, in the end, to pull it off.  It's certainly worth a watch and many may love it; equally, though, I suspect that many will end up disappointed or just plain puzzled.Performances from the principals -- Ellen Page, Susan Sarandon and Cillian Murphy -- are exemplary, especially Murphy as John/Emma. The atmosphere created through the sets, the filming and the dialogue is simultaneously dated and yet contemporary, having a feeling of isolation and separation from time itself -- more discomforting dissociation for the audience to deal with. The screenplay has scenes that are charming, moving and funny, interlaced with those that are excruciatingly poignant and painful -- or just plain nail-biting. Ultimately, though, I found the film let down in the end by a storyline that gradually loses all believability as it progresses and as people's dealings with John and Emma being increasingly unrealistic, unobservant and, in some case, just plain irrational.  And, as for the ending...","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS7776WMPDWE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037E8HOC#wasThisHelpful","RS7776WMPDWE5","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Weetabix Oaty Bars"" are pretty much standard industrial confection flaunted by the manufacturers as ""high fibre"" and ""low calorie"" and thereby managing to masquerade as a healthy food choice, whilst actually providing rather more air and packaging material than you think you're paying for. There are two main reasons that each of these bars contains few calories: the first is that about one third of its weight is supplied by oligofructose syrup, a cheap, manufactured sweetener derived mostly from acacia gum or chicory, which, by virtue of being indigestible to humans contains almost no calories. Being digestible by the bacteria of the large intestine, though, gives it the added benefit of promoting the activity of beneficial microflora of the gut, thereby allowing the manufacturers to wave the ""healthy"" flag over the product. The second reason the bars contain few calories is that they are actually tiny and contain very little substance: each bar takes up less than two thirds of their hermetically sealed, gas-filled wrappers and weighs in at a paltry 23g in total. Most of the volume of each bar is actually air, cunningly concealed in a light, gooey matrix of puffed rice. With a total of only 7g of cereal to a bar, though, they hardly count as ""high fibre"" in absolute terms.This is not to say that Weetabix are any more dishonest than any other manufacturer in their presentation of these snacks: they are not.In the mouth, the bars do have a good firm texture and are nicely chewy but like most of these snacks, anyone used to actual healthy cereal bars will find that taste-wise they don't really stack up. By and large, they are all far too sweet and have a strong artificial and chemical-tasting flavour that persists as an after-taste long after the bar has gone.  My wife declared these ""Strawberry Crusher"" flavoured ones inedible, which for her makes them worse that Alpen's Alpen Light Chocolate and Orange Cereal Bars, which she merely decreed ""disgusting"". Personally, I preferred these but I won't be rushing to replace them once they're gone.As a light snack to make you think you've eaten something and therefore shouldn't have anything else, these bars may work to reduce snacking of the less healthy variety, as long as you like the taste. Under no circumstances should they be mistaken for an energy bar, despite their sweetness; they essentially provide no nutritional value whatsoever.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MPBQC6FX3STR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EPJ91W#wasThisHelpful","R2MPBQC6FX3STR","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With ""The Road to Reckoning"", Robert Lautner has delivered a remarkable d√©but novel. Set in America, in 1837, it tells the story of 12-year-old Thomas Walker and his widower father, a former spectacles salesman, who determines to leave New York in the grip of depression and disease and -- young son in tow -- strike out West in the hope of making his fortune by acting as a sales agent for Samuel Colt's Patent Arms Manufacturing Company. Equipped with little more than a wooden replica of Colt's revolutionary fire-arm, the Paterson -- the world's first practical revolver -- and a handful of ""samples"", the pair set off on what Thomas views as the grandest of all possible adventures. Thomas' father, however, knows little about guns and even less about their handling and, it turns out, altogether too little about the reality of life outside the bounds of city civility. It is not long at all before the boy's big adventure turns into a nightmare and he finds himself orphaned and alone in the depths of the Pennsylvanian badlands and desperate to find his way home.The story is narrated in the first person but recounted from the perspective of Thomas in later life, at a time long after he has himself laid his own two teenage sons in the ground, front-line casualties of the American Civil War. The blend of child's and man's thinking in the narrative is a real gem -- the sagacity of age mixed with the matter-of-fact simplicity of expression and clarity of uncluttered thought is breathtaking in its effectiveness. In part, the book offers a poignant commentary on the American love affair with firearms and the role that the cheap, factory-produced revolving chamber handgun had to play in this -- as the author says: ""[Colt's] invention would change the world forever but perhaps not for the better; as the saying goes: 'The Lord made men, but Sam Colt made them equal.'"" In the book, Thomas declares ""I, to this day, hold to only one truth: if a man chooses to carry a gun he will get shot. My father agreed to carry twelve.""The author paints an evocative portrait of the social landscape of pioneer back-woods America in the first half of the nineteenth century. The book is also about becoming a man and what it means to be a father. Its principal success, though, lies in the masterful characterisation of Thomas and the former Indiana ranger, Henry Stands, whom he inveigles into becoming his guide, helper and protector. During the course of his time in the wilds, Thomas learns much about the many forms that villainy can take and that it often lurks in the places you least expect to find it.While the events and plot-lines here are hardly original, the voice behind the telling is so charming and convincing that this matters not in the slightest. Once the tale really gets going, it becomes all but impossible to put the book down. All in all, I have only one complaint of this book -- it is over and done far too soon -- it is fairly short and also makes for fast reading. But also, one doesn't really want to part company from the charming and endearing protagonist.The most surprising thing about the book, perhaps, is that it is written by a Brit; I doubt that anyone is going to notice.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NTPMZ3DWAF2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476731632#wasThisHelpful","R3NTPMZ3DWAF2U","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""NUK Multi Dry"" is a cross between an intriguing piece of kitchen Lego and a 3-dimensional jigsaw puzzle. It ships as a flat pack of assorted plastic components (all proudly labelled as BPA-free) which you have to work out how to assemble into a strange blossom-like sculpture, and for which you then need to find both a home and a use.  The manufacturers intend you to hang feeding bottles and other baby-nursing paraphernalia from its various plastic petals and stamens to dry. Personally I think a standard draining rack serves the purpose just as well and makes more efficient use of one's draining board -- the large circular nature of this gadget means it needs a lot of room for not very much utilisation; it has space for about six small bottles or so.The construction looks sturdy and it is stable in use, provided your bottles and other accessories are either small or themselves made of plastic. Being dishwasher safe, it is also easy to keep spotlessly clean. All the same, I can't help feeling though that this gadget is very much a solution looking for a problem.But it does look cute and I bet it makes a great toddler toy!","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CYNHK5GT4GLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B4PKZG4#wasThisHelpful","R2CYNHK5GT4GLM","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Ready Brek"" is one of those things that immediately transports me back almost fifty years to early memories of standing in a chilly kitchen in a pre-dawn half-light, heating milk on the hob to pour into a bowl of this fine oaty powder to make an instant, warming breakfast before dashing out to catch the bus to school.  Oddly, I haven't touched the stuff since those early school years and have subsequently come to file it away mentally as one of those childhood foodstuffs that I'd simply grown out of.  Coming back to it now, I am surprised to find that, first of all, it is exactly as I remember it and, secondly, it remains just as acceptable to my adult palate as it was to that of my childhood (although these days I'd prefer it to have a little more texture).It is good to see that ""Ready Brek""'s formulation doesn't seem to have changed at all over the intervening years and is still primarily finely rolled oats and oat flour. It is particularly heartening that the manufacturers have still not seen fit to sweeten it at all -- something that is rare, these days. In these times of microwave ovens, it is even easier to make than it was in days of yore (although the old fashioned way still works best, I think) and it takes no time or effort at all to prepare.  Most kids (and some adults) will probably need to add a little sugar (or jam) just to pep up the taste a bit -- many may find it too bland otherwise.My wife somehow managed to avoid ""Ready Brek"" altogether as a child and so this sampling was a first for her. As a dyed in the wool Scots porridge aficionado (made with water and salt, not any of this milk and sugar nonsense) she was not expecting to enjoy the experience. We were both surprised therefore when she gave her first bowlful the thumbs up. While ""Ready Brek"" may not be as solid and satisfying as a good bowl of proper oatmeal porridge, it is certainly comforting and remains a good start to a busy cold winter's day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ELNBZ83UDG2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P41FBO#wasThisHelpful","R1ELNBZ83UDG2T","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Natalie Young's second novel, ""Season to Taste (or How to Eat Your Husband)"", is a very strange book indeed. The title tells you pretty much all you need to know about its subject matter and, yes, it is every bit as grim and gruesome as it sounds. It is, however, surprisingly hard to turn away from, as the author alternately and repeatedly disgusts and then endears the reader to the protagonist, Lizzie, and her rather bizarre choice of a method of disposing of the body of the husband she casually bumps off one day.The narrative is cleverly constructed, although ultimately I felt it was its very cleverness that is its own undoing, because the story seems to my mind to have just a twist or two too many for its own good, leaving me thinking I'd missed something by the end. Beneath its macabre outer trappings, the book is essentially a tale of disappointment, disillusionment and liberation from life's little tyrannies. It is well written, the prose sparse yet human. Its main merit (in addition to a certain originality, which gives the author plenty of scope for exploring ground that has hardly been touched in literature before) is its brevity; most readers should be able to consume it all within a single sitting -- provided they can stomach the subject.  I'm not at all convinced it will leave many satisfied in the end, however.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R227I88NA3GFA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0LV2RO#wasThisHelpful","R227I88NA3GFA9","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Last Rituals"" is the English language release of ""√ûri√∞ja t√°kni√∞ (The Third Symbol)"" by Icelandic novelist, Yrsa Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir. This book marked the author's  crime novel d√©but, in 2005, with this English translation (by the late Bernard Scudder) dating from 2007.The book itself is an odd mix. It opens as an unusually gory, gruesome and altogether bizarre murder mystery, involving macabre mutilations, student drug-taking, black magic cults and Mediaeval witch trials. From there, though, it quickly morphs into something that is much more a routine sample of romantic, investigative chick-lit. The book's central protagonist is a middle aged lawyer and divorcee with two children, Th√≥ra Gudmundsd√≥ttir, who is hired by the family of the murder victim -- a German postgraduate student at the University of Iceland -- to investigate the truth of his death.  Although not an investigative lawyer herself, Th√≥ra is lured by the outrageously large (or, as she phrases it, ""interesting"") fee and soon finds herself accompanying handsome German ex-policeman, Matthew Reich, into investigations into the darker deeds of Iceland's ancient as well as the immediate past.The author has quite clearly done her homework when it comes to background research for the book, with extensive historical detail adding depth and richness to the telling of the story. Unfortunately, the book's main characters are portrayed so stereotypically and are so predictable in their behaviours that they descend almost to the level of caricature. Additionally, the novel's plot is so outrageously silly, that it is hard to take the book at all seriously. This somehow makes the gory bits more funny than horrific, which -- while it does make the book less harrowing to some extent -- left me at least with a distinct feeling of unease.If this were a book by an American or even British novelist, I would probably have few problems with it, for this is very much a classic whodunnit (and a moderately good one too), which is Icelandic in character only in as much as that it where it is set. The book features many of the sites that most foreign tourists to that land will visit at some stage during a visit. Th√≥ra's office is even located right in the heart of Reykjavik's tourist area on Sk√≥lav√∂r√∞ust√≠gur and her home in the same suburb of the city as the author herself, Seltjarnarnes. All of this somehow lends the story something of a forced and artificial feel, when it comes to location and settings.Many readers will no doubt read this book and value it for what is. For those readers more used to the ultra-realism of Iceland's other notable crime writer, Arnaldur Indri√∞ason (""Jar City"" etc), this book may well seem tacky and superficial -- rather like the endless mounds of fluffy stuffed puffins, seals and 'hidden folk' that line the shelves in the shops of Iceland's tourist centres. And, all in all, something of a disappointment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RLFEVH2JUIWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003LPV136#wasThisHelpful","R2RLFEVH2JUIWY","A3P222CN9HAPTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P222CN9HAPTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Since I didn't plan on having to move mine, I decided to buy the one with three umbrellas, and no carrying case.  So far, I have been pretty happy with them save for one annoying issue.What I like:They do light up an area nicely, and the lights seem to be of the right wavelength to get proper color in pictures.The gold umbrella will install a strong yellowish light, and it must be used correctly to shade, fill or color.  The other two work great and are pretty predictable.The lights come up to speed fairly quickly, like a couple minutes.  I take a lot of pictures for eBay, so I am taking pictures off a white clothed table with a white backdrop, and these eliminate shadows, etc.What I don't like:They are not that powerful.  I find that the umbrella units have to be fairly close to shoot with the lighting I like.The gold umbrella seems to be more powerful and reflect more than the other two, so the yellowish light can invade more strongly.  I keep mine off to the side to it kind of cross catches the white light of the white umbrellas and mixes.  It works out fine.One of the sockets was bad, or so I thought.  I am pretty handy, so I took it apart and found a switch that was erratic.  I don't have any of the issues with the sockets as some have said - but I came up with a bad switch.  So far, I have not found a suitable replacement and may just straight wire it so it comes on when I turn on my power switch, which I use to turn on all three.  If I want to slow down the lighting a bit, I can just unscrew a light bulb a bit.Overall, for this price?  Silly good for the amateur photographer and eBayers like myself.  And having three umbrellas, bulbs, long cords?  Quite a deal, actually.UPDATE, Aug, 2015. After using this unit for months, I finally determined that I did NOT have a bad socket, but a bulb with a loose connection inside.

"I was into sand blasting years back, with a Central Pneumatic benchtop unit.  The gloves finally gave up, and it leaked like a sieve, so finally I gave up.I wanted to get back in, but pricing was an issue.  Here, I can get back in for less than $200.What I like about this unit:It is a good home unit as far as size, stability, and capability.The window is glass, with a plexi film on the top, and a stick-on plastic film on the bottom to protect the glass.  Mine came with five extra stick-on films, so I was happy about that.  I don't understand the other viewers comment about stick-on film.  Why wouldn't you want something to protect the glass?The gun is fine. The hoses I will address below.It leaks, but only seems to leak about the window frame.  A little foam during installation, like that inexpensive window foam will take care of this.  The rest of the cabinet seems fine.I like their move to a plastic door.  The old metal doors they used to use were thin, often got bent up going back and forth, so this is an improvement.Love the shelf.  Great place to store spare nozzle tips, and other small items you may be using or even blasting.  It is in there for stability, but quickly becomes a nice shelf.What I don't like:-The gloves are cheap.  I expect to be replacing them within a year or so.-The light is strange.  I first thought it was an LED stick light, but it seems to be a low voltage fluorescent.  I don't like the transformer at the end of the cheap cord, and I usually unplug it rather than use the switch on the side, which by the way installs upside down, so off is up.  The light also flutters after a while, I think maybe due to the static?  I don't know, but some advocate replacing it with LED pucks.  I hesitate due to the battery issues with these. So far, I am doing OK with the provided light, but am thinking of changing it out for a good stick LED unit.-This is an absolute BEAR to assemble.  Think propane gas grill, times two.  I am a pretty good mechanic, and general fix-it guy, the one guy in my neighborhood people come to for tools, advice and help.  This took me a full six hours to assemble, fine tune, and get right.-The hoses - ohhh, the hoses...They are TOO soft and kink.  They pop off their fittings even with stainless steel worm clamps.  And the fittings are too smooth.  Just bite the bullet, go to a big box store, and buy that stiffer clear hose in the same diameter in the plumbing department and a couple of decent barbed hose fittings.  It is the air supply hose that is the biggest problem with staying on, and the bigger pickup hose kinks almost automatically.  I replaced both and I am very happy I did.  Cost about $10.  Made all the difference in the world.  With the originals, you are so busy trying to see through the cloud and watch your article you are blasting you don't realize the original hoses will crimp almost all the time, eliminating your air or ability to pick up media.Finally, beware of the door on the bottom.  I knew it would leak a little - I put a bucket below.  What I didn't realize was the speed it will tear itself out of your hand with only 6-8 lbs of media in the unit, and knock over your bucket and drop all your media on the floor.  And I added a copper washer to the clamp rod that holds the door to make it seal tighter so it won't leak.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DVW0SEUO8IUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094GCX8S#wasThisHelpful","R1DVW0SEUO8IUY","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first bought these and took a sleeve to the course, I was in the middle of a swing change.  I was trying to eliminate coming over the top too much, and was putting more of a baseball swing.  So I pulled the ball a lot.  Not hook, pull.True to form, this ball went straight - straight with the pull and into the woods.  I could actually see it straightening itself out as it headed for the lumber.  Oh well, at the price I paid, back in the bag for a while...Then I played them again last week, determined to use them with irons, fairway woods, and also my swing was now pretty much corrected and I don't pull anymore.  Here are the results:I hit a slight draw now, and by golly, the doggone thing actually took a bit of an S curve in air, straightening out.  I could not believe I was seeing a golf ball do this!My irons, when I align the ball on the fairway, goes straight, but check up?  Forget about it.  If I let the ball lie where it is, almost always somewhere off the alignment of the shallow dimples, it checks up rather nicely if I am hitting into a green.  My Rocketballz irons have a tendency to hit them with a little more loft, so checking up is not too hard, but now they just stop dead and back up about 6 inches.  Aligned, they will bounce forward about a foot or two.  Interesting.Obviously, when I am playing with someone new, or in any kind of league, I don't use them.  This is a recreational ball only for fun and enjoyment.  That includes most of the golfers out there these days, I believe.  I am semi-retired, and my weekday play with friends allows me to play these since we don't bet, or have mini-tournaments.  I also am teaching one neighbor, so when he is struggling I often pull one out and don't tell him, and my constant straight hits drive him crazy, but make him concentrate harder and try to do better.  Maybe I'm being cruel, but it's better than trying to correct his swing on the course.Either way, these do work.  For fun, great ball.  Just don't get caught in that weekday choose-up using one of these.  You'll probably get thrown out of the grouping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UKYC3LOCVWVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CMRPQO#wasThisHelpful","R1UKYC3LOCVWVC","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Found these on sale at D**k's, before they were available here.  For a 24 pack, my wife and I thought they would be possibly another poor golf ball.For me, up until they built the Gamer, I was not much of a Top Flite fan.  It seems like they have transferred that knowledge and added even more into this ball.  We found a lively ball, feels very soft off the club, good distance, and sticks like glue on short approaches.What I like:Does not seem to lose the yardage due to being so soft like the Callaway Supersofts.Price is just crazy good.Decent distance, good rebound off your putter, and sticks nicely.We read about these before we bought, but thought that they would probably be another overhyped soft compression ball.

"As usual, we get ants in our kitchen area every couple of years.  Living in the South, it is a bit of a problem.We tried this product and were disappointed.  It says, ""Kills the queen, kills the colony"".Not so...We find that the ants are certainly attracted to this bait.  Unfortunately, they eat it and make it maybe 2-3 feet back and start to die.  Some stagger around some, but it appears that none of them make it back to the nest to feed the others.  So no matter where you put these baits, you end up with a mess of ants roaming around the baits, some half dead, a few dead, some still trying to go for more.  And since the colony is not affected, all you really end up with is an ant attractant.  I put them behind the stove, my stove edges ended up with lots of ants roaming around.  Under the fridge, same thing.  My wife made the mistake of putting these baits in a cupboard and within about 24 hours the lower shelf was covered with dead and slow ants.  What a mess.Other brands of this type of bait allows them to make it back to the nest where they feed off and slowly die.  Usually takes about three-four days.

"Found this book in a used book store.  As a 44 year master woodworker, I don't remember this style of woodworking ever taking off in any measure.  Still, it seems like fun and is comparatively easy, albeit time consuming.  I don't think his statement of a gallery paying $2000 for a large rocker and child's rocker would hold water today, since style and technique have developed so much people expect much more.The book itself is rather cheap newsprint, with low quality black and white pictures.  Some imagination is needed in some cases.  Also, he did not have the availability of modern day power grinding tools, such as the King Arthur series, which would make a lot of what he uses obsolete.  But, with all that being said, sometimes things come in style again after a couple of decades, so I might try one or two of these and see.  I have done laminated plywood bowls on the lathe, and they usually sell rather fast, although not anywhere at the levels he describes.Maybe the time has come again for a little laminated plywood carved furniture.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IZ0Z5MLO1AKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830639365#wasThisHelpful","R1IZ0Z5MLO1AKK","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this unit after my Hamilton Beach carafe-less unit finally starting leaking internally, which I knew it would.After looking over all the offerings in reasonable price ranges, decided on this unit from Wa*-M^%t.It looks sleek, easy controls, variable brews, and I like that the carafe sits well inside the unit, without the handle sticking out.What I like:1. The coffee maker itself has variable brew.  Nice touch, although you will have to experiment a bit to see how much your grind compares with the ""Normal"", ""Strong"", ""Gourmet"", and ""Bold"" settings.  I tend to stick with Normal, and adjust the amount of coffee I put into it, rather than have to set this thing every time I start it.  Normal makes great coffee.2. Although I am not fond of the grill-like cover that you are supposed to pour your water through to fill the reservoir, simply lifting the complete lid reveals a larger area to pour your water into, and it is fine.  It also comes with one of those ball shaped filter units that you push in, which is a step up from the old HB I had, which had no provision for any water filter.  It is also cheaper than the Mr. Coffee ring filters, which seem like an after market way to keep sucking money out of your wallet.3. The unit keeps coffee HOT.  This is good, since I drink from large mug, and often I have cold coffee at the end of the mug, unless it is hot to start with.4.  Some lower cost carafes have an open handle on the bottom, with sharp edges of the plastic handle.  If you are one of those people who put your pinkie under the handle when you hold it, like me, this carafe is much better since it has a closed handle all the way down, nice and smooth.What I don't like:1.  There has been much discussion here about the carafe.  I have had many carafes in my lifetime, and mine doesn't leak or pour all over the place.  Maybe I am just used to pouring more conservatively, or maybe they changed the design a little.  What I don't like is the fact I cannot get it all out of the carafe due to an internal lip at the top of the carafe.  Dumbest thing I've seen in a while.  Can't get all the coffee out, and cannot get all the rinse water out, or the fresh water into the reservoir.  Awkward and useless to put the carafe in the receiving position when you know there is already an ounce or two of plain water in the carafe.2.  You have to push a button to get it to keep coffee warm past two hours, but only after one hour of it already being warm.  Who remembers that after an hour of the coffee being made, you have to stop by and hit the Warm button again?  They give you the three hour feature, you should be able to set this before you start making the coffee, not at some period when you've made the coffee, consumed your first cup, and off to other things.  ""Oh, got to go and push the button so I can get another hour of warm coffee""...NOT.3.  I am not a real fan of the micro-filter permanent type of filters.  You always get some micro grinds in your coffee, which muddies up the brew.  So I use the disposable paper filters.  Unfortunately they don't fit that well in the receiver where you put your grounds.  The wall is too high, and the steaming water can wash your paper filter off the wall, allowing not only clean water to get through, it can cause some of the grounds to actually make it down, at least micro grounds.  I finally learned how to make it so the paper filter kind of stays in place, by carefully pushing it against the wall of the grounds holder, before I make the coffee.  An annoyance, but you can get around it.Overall, this is a pretty good bargain for the money.  You get a coffee maker that does what it is supposed to do, give you a great cup of coffee and not do it with a lot of hassle.  But with the carafe issues, from people spilling coffee to my complaint on it keeping liquid inside due to the silly lip, I knocked off a star. Also don't care for the high wall of the grounds holder.Otherwise, this is a good maker.One last thing:  It makes a lot of noise when finishing.  And it does not have a beeper to let you know it is finished.  Some people like a beeper, some to not.  I like one beep.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S2ZPV4QP7M4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSABIG4#wasThisHelpful","R3S2ZPV4QP7M4","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Found these in a Du*&%m's on sale.  Bought the whole set.  Seems like I end up buying a new set of wedges every year or two.The color drew me in.  It is rather stunning, to say the least.  You will love the color, or hate it.  It looks like someone took a blowtorch to a steel finish, and the end result is a rainbow sort of ""Trusty Rusty"" type of finish.  They also make a black chrome finish in this same model, but I went for the ""blowtorch"" look.What I like about them:1. The grooves are prominent on the club.  You can actually feel them scratching at your finger when you wipe it across the face.  Most other wedges seemed much smoother and less likely to make a ball check up.  And check up it does, when you hit it on the face.2. The face is nice and large, with a larger top area to help the amateur make sure they make contact with the ball.3. In addition to the grooves being larger, the face is sand blasted and is also grippy.  This is usual for a lot of wedges, but with this finish, more prominent here, to a small degree.  Surprisingly, the black chrome finished ones I looked at seemed to even be slightly more sanded, but I didn't like the finish and the clubhead is identical.4.  No silly final wedges.  This is a standard 56', 60', and 64' set, without that crazy 68' or 72' that Pinemeadow and others sometimes offer in their sets, which usually ends up in your basement or in your garage sale.5.  No grind on the back edge of the sole.  For some, this means no ""two clubs in one"", and may be put off by the lack of this feature.  But for the amateur, having the club stable even when opening the face some is helpful.  It is a lot of practice and hard to get used to that second ground surface.  And there are actually four types of this grind.  Mostly on off the shelf clubs, you see what is called an arc grind, where the center section of the back of the sole is ground so you have a second flat to open the club up and rest on.  Problem is, it is small and hard to maintain flat on the ground during the swing, so a lot of amateurs are better off without it.  I fit that category.What I don't like so far:1.  They don't offer a 52'.  To some, this exclusion prevents this from being a complete set.  On the other hand, if you have a pitching wedge in your normal iron set, you probably have a 52' already in your bag, or at least a 48', which you can open a little.  So these are really a short distance club set, where you might carry only two of them at a time, depending on the course you decide to play and the size of you normal iron set.2.  Remember the big grooves and sanded face I mentioned?  Well, the drawback to this is you cannot really pitch and run with these since you will check a little, no matter how much you hood these when you swing.  The face is going to initiate backspin,  as long as you get the ball on the face, and you can depend on at least some checking.  I found this out immediately in the store in their little chipping area, even before I got them out to play.  But I wanted my wedges to check the ball.  That is a common problem for amateurs, lack of checking.  If I pitch and run, I often go old school and use my eight iron.  Others want a bit of a flop and then a strong release, and these have a harder time doing that.3.  Grips are terrible.  Not as bad as some I've seen, like the cheap Texans, but still they must be replaced.  I use an oversize grip, so when I first got the set home, off they came and my usual Lamkin Oversized grips went on.4.  Finish will scratch and not last.  It even started coming off in the store as I tried out the 60'.  I think we all know this with cheap wedges - that the fancy finishes will go bye-bye.  But the face has stayed pretty well intact over time, so the ball flight is rather dependable over time.Overall, getting a complete set of 56', 60', and 64' for less than $75 is a great bargain, and that is what you get here.  Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38W80ML5LVT5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004C89B3S#wasThisHelpful","R38W80ML5LVT5D","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this for a 12 string I am building.  Here are my findings:What I like:The 12 individual ""saddles"" are actually six normal saddles, and then six L shaped brackets that act as the second set of saddles, riding along with the ability to move on their own, within the movement of the main saddle it rides on.  So you adjust the main saddle, and then adjust the L shaped saddle mounted on the side.There is plenty of movement in the saddles, and the up/down movement is generous also.The screws and gold finish seem to be top notch.  Sometimes on cheap bridges when you move a saddle with a string under tension, the up/down screws can scratch the chrome finish.  Not here.What I don't like:Six of the strings are through-back, and six are through-body.  Not a real problem, but the six that go through the body are not drilled in a row.  Your ferrules on the backside of your guitar will not be allowed to be drilled in a straight line, if you want to meet up with the holes in the bridge.  Looks funky on the backside of the guitar with three ""pairs"" of ferrules that are not in a straight line.The L shaped secondary saddles are not really saddles, but little L shaped brackets with oblong holes in the long length, with a screw that mounts on the main saddle it rides with.  Also, it is a tiny bit lower than the main saddle, so you have to tip the height screws just a tiny bit to get the strings level.I had the high G string slip down between the L bracket and the main saddle.  There is just a tiny bit of notch in the L shaped saddle, and since it is  hooked to the main saddle body it rides on with only one screw, it can move away just a bit, and my string slipped down in the space between the main G saddle and the L bracket G.Overall, this is a great way to individually adjust 12 strings for proper intonation.  The old style six saddle units with twin grooves in each saddle don't cut it in the intonation department.  But the thru-body holes not being drilled in a straight line, and the L brackets seem to be a bit of a cheap bit of engineering that could have been much better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B6IUCJI7ROYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EB126KG#wasThisHelpful","R1B6IUCJI7ROYM","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, I've owned mine now for about six months, and finally started to run low on the starter cartridges.  We have a typical home setup, with two laptops, a DSL router, and this printer.  I have been wired to this printer with my computer while my wife ran out of ink on her old Kodak printer, and we finally made the switch to where we both use this printer in Wi-Fi mode.What we like:1.  It turned out surprisingly easy to install the wireless function.  I just followed the directions in the quick guide, installed the suite on my wife's computer since it was already on mine, selected the wireless functions on the printer as in the guide, let all three units, (two laptops and the printer), find each other, and we have been good to go.2.  I got more pages out of the starter cartridges than I thought I would.  I bought the off-brand replacement cartridges here on Amazon that rate 4.8 stars as replacements, and so far, so good.3.  Although the picture resolution is not what some people may like, for us it is just as good as our old Kodaks, and we're happy.  It is a little harder to find picture paper that is compatible with laser printers.  Most is for inkjets.4.  The copy function works well.5.  So far, two sided printing has worked flawlessly.  I printed out a complete manual for a Nikon D5000 camera, (152 pages), and double sided all of it.  Worked perfectly.What we do not like:1.  Since we took it to wireless, sometimes it just comes on for no reason.  It doesn't print anything, but goes through some kind of process.  Lasts about one minute.  You can be in another room and think it is printing something.  Odd.2.  The paper tray is almost dead against the desktop.  When you go to put paper in this thing, pulling the drawer out will entail removing everything you might have in front, even a few pieces of paper.  So leave some space in front of the printer to allow for this.3.  The warning lights and commands to change out the toner cartridges come on way too soon.  We read the first review here on how to reset that little problem, and so far, it is working well.  Milks a lot more pages out of the cartridges.  Still, I know they want to make money on the ink, but sheesh! I reset the black about 2 weeks ago, and I am still using the same original black cartridge.4.  HUGE footprint for a home.  Takes up almost half of my desk.Overall, we are totally happy we made the jump to laser in the home.

"I've been using whole house humidifiers for years.  This one has been in my house for almost seven years.  With a complete end-of-year cleaning, and faithfully using the humidifier anti-bacterial/fungus, we have had trouble free service.1.  You have to change the filters every year.  The best thing is when you know you will end its use for the season, take out the filters and toss them immediately.  Do not let then fester in the unit.2. Take the base and outside, rinse it out with a hose.  Put in a little bleach and rinse again.  Let it air dry outside.3.  Make sure you take off all the caps on the bottles for storage.  We usually take them off, let them dry for a couple hours, (the seals, mainly), and than put them in a sealed plastic bag and toss them into the bottom so we don't lose them.

"I was in my local Dicks, trying out new 3 and 5 woods.  Has been a constant struggle to find decent fairway woods.  I am older and my swing speed is now down in the high 80's, sometimes in the low 90's.I was trying out the Nike Convert adjustable 3 wood and the Callaway Razr X 3 wood.  Both were OK, but not much more than what I have been getting out of an older Adams Tight Lies.Then the guy at Dicks put this in my hands.  Although it was more money, I immediately hit it not only 12-15 yards more on the same simulator, I found myself hitting it straighter.I asked him why he thought I was hitting this further.He explained that the Taylor Made people put Senior Shafts on these, called M shafts.  He had been paying attention to my swing speed on the simulator, not my distance.  Callaway and Nike apparently do not put anything more flexible than Regular shafts on their fairway woods.  After my wife came up and looked things over, the price and the results on the simulator, we popped for both the 3 and 5, both in Senior shafts.  I had to special order the 5, Dicks does not carry a Senior M shaft 5 wood in the stores.My first round, I had my first chance to use this three wood after hitting a poor drive on a 350 yard par four.  I had 185 left, according to my Bushnell.  Out came this new 3 wood.  I tried to take my smoothest swing, and hit a screaming drive, very slight fade no more than green wide, and it bounced up onto the green, landing about four feet from the pin.  Never in my life...I birdied the hole, and this club and also my newly arrived 5 wood are now securely in my bag.Thanks to Taylor Made to recognize those folks who swing slower.  Like Cleveland with that 270 Classic Driver with the very flexible senior shaft, this club is made for hitters like me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQR0EWFSU3TJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H5F015C#wasThisHelpful","RQR0EWFSU3TJ5","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a Bushnell range with Jolt for quite a while.  Got into my local Golfsmith to just lay hands on one, and they also had this model.  I found this slightly bigger model with a larger reticle to not only be easier to use, the bright red lettering inside is MUCH easier to read. The price was also right, at a slim $329.  I also loved the horizontal arrangement rather then the vertical, like the V3. I popped right there.I bought the unit and came home to read reviews about recalls and failures which Golfsmith did not talk about.  I registered the product, and immediately contacted Bushnell Support at 1-800-423-3537 to see if I had just bought a lemon.I was told that these units did go through a recall about two years ago, but mine, although built about 24 months ago, should be fine and not in the problem area.  THIS IS WHAT THEY TOLD ME ON THE PHONE. We'll see...Other than that, I love the unit and cannot wait to get on the course with it.  Knocked off a star since it is a little larger, just a tiny bit too big to put into my pocket.  Other than that, it measured exact with two other Bushnell models in the store, measuring distance to signs and trees outside the store.  And the bright red readout, WAY better than the dark blue on the V3.UPDATE: MORE RESEARCH... Even though I was assured by Bushnell support on August 5th, 2014 that this unit will be fine, reading many Internet reports I have come to believe that this unit had a fatal processor error.  You may never see it, but if you buy one, it is best to buy it at a brick and mortar store, keep your receipt and box and all paperwork, and apparently at this time it is totally discontinued.  Bushnell is selling off old stock.  Looking closely at mine, it had a March 2012 manufacture date, and some very small scuffs like it was maybe used before.  I wonder if I simply got a repaired one?  No one knows of any official recall, just many, many repairs and replacements plus some speculation that the main processors may have had some bad lots that they just pushed through manufacture.  If yours does fail, Bushnell will replace it most likely with a V3 Jolt model, and a fair gift certificate to a major golf chain.  I plan on using mine a lot, and if it fails, I will simply call Bushnell and cash in. It seems that if they fail, 90% of the failures happen within a few months, well within the warranty period.  Glad I got the two year warranty, and mine is registered.  Great unit...hope it holds up.  One star removed.UPDATE #2:  First round confirmed what I like about this unit.  The horizontal orientation is way better than the vertical.  I could use two hands easily to zero in on flags.  For some reason, my local club uses different colored flags, some even dark blue.  This unit found them easily, even with a forest very close to the back of the green.  Bright red readout is exactly what I wanted. Fanny pack bag us useless.  I kept mine in the lined pocket reserved for keys and such in my bag.  So far, so good...","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZBO993PPXXY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHFZ6F2#wasThisHelpful","R1ZBO993PPXXY6","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love the glove, fits me well.  But I have a slightly larger than average hand.  Is this truly a ""one-size fits all"" glove?  Not on your life.  But, it does have a couple things going for it that I really liked:1.  It has a double layer around the fleshy part of your palm where a lot of gloves wear out first.  Love that.2.  It is made of a synthetic material that is obviously more durable than leather.  I know, purists will balk at the fact this is not leather and that deerskin feel, but this stuff is downright tacky and I like that.3. They come in cool, off-beat colors.  For some strange reason, I was attracted to the green.Couple of things that are gimmicks or just silly:1.  One size fits all is not a reality.  Bring me an NFL lineman and let's see if he can put on my Zero Friction glove...2. The first thing I removed is that silly tee in the tee holder.  There are some places you just don't put pointy tees, and the back of my hand is one of those places.3.  The color choices may turn off some traditional people who think all gloves should be white.  Personally, I like the choices and may go back for some other colors, just to change it up a little, round to round.UPDATE: 8/17/14 I have since gone back and purchased another green glove and one orange one.  They are really a nice glove, and work well.  I am also happy to see that somehow, these breath much better than my usual Footjoy or Callaway gloves, which almost always come off sweaty and wet here in the South.

"They are not the best ball I've ever played, nor are they the softest.  They do, however, produce a predictable distance.  In other words, once you dial them in, ball to ball they are pretty consistent and you know how far they will go.  Some of the slightly softer balls are a little more variable.I find them easy to putt.  They are great around the green, and stick well.  They reach a normal height in drives.

"This brace is NOT a cure-all.  What it does do is support your knee joints by latching onto your leg above and below the knee cap area.  I'm certainly no doctor, but I've been wearing this for a few days now, and from my perspective, it reduces stress and pain by about 60-70%.  The way my joints have deteriorated, I have very little cartilage left, based on a recent visit to my doctor and subsequent X-rays.  But still enough to not operate.  I am on Celebrex, which helped.  The problems were: Golf, which I love, and stores shopping, on flat concrete.  For some reason I would be in massive pain after about one hour on hard concrete.Not now.  This supports the knee and keeps the joint supported with less stress, hence less pain.Highly recommended, as long as you make certain to measure your size correctly.

"This club is sold as Affinity, Olimar, and Intech.  All the same club.  I found mine in a Dunham's on sale for $19.95. There was a big hole in the club rack where these sale clubs were, I bought the last one.At the range, I was pleasantly surprised to find, (maybe not so much, considering what I paid for my Callaway Razr X Black), that I hit this consistently about 10 yards further than my Callaway.  Every time.  I am older, and a 200-210 yard drive is OK for me.  This was consistently in the 220 yard range.It is also about 10 grams lighter than the Callaway, on my wife's digital food scale set to grams.  I believe that transfers into a slightly higher swing speed.The shaft is an EMC Uniflex/Low Torque/High Trajectory Kick Point.  That means that it should be better for beginners and seniors.  By the way, the EMC was the standard shaft used on the Callaway Diablo driver, now almost two years old but still available for about twice the price of this driver.As long as you can take the jokes and comments from your buddies on your ""knock-off"" driver, you can simply let the ball do the talking and this driver will deliver.

"These arrive in a USPS Priority Mail box, 10"" X 7 3/8"" X 5"" prepaid box.  The box is stuffed full of tees, no other packaging.  Is there 1000?  I would assume they are tare weighted into a box.  A quick count by me of the first 100 leads me to believe there might be way more than 1000 in the box.  But who cares, this is a huge amount of tees.These tees seem to be better assembled, head to shaft than the Insignia Eco tees, which tend to lose their heads when you tee off.  The JP Lann tees seem to be glued on, and they stay on unless you snap the shaft.They come in a strong red head with natural shaft, or natural head with strong red colored shaft.  My wife and I both love them, and the 2 3/4"" is fine for us, since I tee it just a little into the ground to handle my Cleveland Classic, and my wife tees it a little lower for her Affinity driver.This is a GREAT bargain, and I would definitely buy them again.

"Here's how the compression ratings work:The USGA has determined that a ball can deflect from round no more then 2/10ths of one inch when struck by a consistent speed driver, that speed being standard to the USGA.  Then they divide that 2/10ths of an inch into 200, so the deflection is measured by high speed camera in the thousandths of an inch, and they get a 0 to 200 scale.To make it interesting, they reversed the numbers so, if it deflects the whole 2/10ths of an inch, the rating is zero, for zero compression which is actually full compression.  If it does not deflect at all, the rating is 200.  Just for the record, there are no 200 rated balls on the market.  That would be a rock.So when Wilson Staff says this is a zero compression ball, that only means it deflects a total 2/10ths of one inch when hit by the driver speed as dictated by the USGA.What does that mean for the average player?  Larger rebound, and a little more distance on slower swing speeds.  It also should stick better when it first strikes the ground on a long iron into a green.This is a win-win ball for amateurs, and the price is just outstanding to boot.  I use them, and I like them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38QQ0HGGB133G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MXIR6K#wasThisHelpful","R38QQ0HGGB133G","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My father put a golf club into my hands at age 7. I was a scratch golfer much of my 20's and early 30's. At 63, I still play a fair game. I am also an industrial manufacturing engineer of 28 years. I believe this club to be almost everything a golf club SHOULD NOT be.1. When golf club head speeds began to climb with the invention of metal woods, the bottom was slightly rounded to ensure the club would hit minimum grass. This club is reversed, so the bottom is almost flat, exactly opposite of what it should be. Touch grass, slow down.2. When a golfer swings, the shaft flexes. It has to happen since the rebound of the flex is what generates much of the club head speed. The non-round shaft of this club will also flex, but I believe it will also twist, which is what shaft manufacturers hate. Twist is when the flexing shaft also twists off center, putting the club head at the wrong angle mid-swing. That is why virtually every shaft is round, so the twist can come back in time with the flex. (Cheaply made round shafts may not.) This shaft stands a greater chance of not doing that, since it is not round and will tend to follow the flattened pattern. End result? Club head has a greater chance to be at the wrong angle at impact.3. The sweet spot of this club is small, and centered. For a pro, that's OK. For an amatuer, that is not so good. Off center hits on 460CC traditional drivers can be fairly forgiving with a decent grip. Not so when there is no sweet spot at the toe or heel. Hit it in the middle or mis-hit. I own classic clubs made in the 50's with bigger sweet spots.4. As clubs developed, the larger drivers became more aerodynamic with trailing edges meant to allow the air to flow past easily, since the club face had grown. With this club, the air WILL swirl around the open back edges and cause a turbulance that will most likely slow down head speed, certainly cause minute strange flex and twist in the shaft, and increase the chance of a mis-hit.Overall, you have to ask yourself one simple question. Why is literally no professional on any tour carrying one, just one, in their bags? You would think this company could come up with at least one...even Scott Verplank carried club COMPONENTS for a while, clubs you made with club parts companies. I've never, ever seen a Hammer X on any tour, in any tournament, and I never expect to. I'm sure they have approached a few new, non-sponsored pros, and offered them free drivers. No takers? Wonder why? Because it is illegal, but not because it hits further.  It does not conform to the 460CC rule, and the shaft is not round.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30JXB36Q50GK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KIT9RB6#wasThisHelpful","R30JXB36Q50GK0","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought this to try and find a decent sharpener for my drawing pencils, especially my softer charcoal pencils.What I like:The push-button fit and face pullback, which seems to hold the pencil well and stops moving once the pencil has a sharp edge.  You put the pencil in gently, press on the button on the side while holding the sharpener face, and pull it open a bit to allow the spring mechanism to grab the pencil, then pull the pencil in while it is being sharpened and you turn the handle.Once everything is adjusted well, it gives you a nice, neat sharp point every time.What I don't like:The Blunt to Pointy adjustment on the back is a hit or miss operation until you get what you want.  Once you get a good tip on your pencil, don't move it.The clamp for the tabletop is not too hot.  Mine has come off a couple of times.  And there is no way to clamp it so the sharpener faces outward from the tabletop, only inward.Since it only faces inward to your desk top, you are forced also to take the shaving cup off onto your desk.Would I buy this again?  Probably not, mainly due to the clamp issue. For decades I was used to sticking a pencil into a sharpener that faced outward of my work surface.  It is a pain to have it facing inward. I like how it sharpens, but in the end it takes up valuable real estate since I have to keep the area in front of clear to make room for a pencil.The fact that it is all plastic, although the actual sharpening mechanism is metal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VM8FDAKLHLRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BNC5PU#wasThisHelpful","R3VM8FDAKLHLRK","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this exact midsized set, (slightly oversized) at another dealer.  It comes with 13 grips and a putter grip, and tape.  The grips are very sticky, as you expect Tacki-Mac grips to be.  At less than $3.00 a grip, you would be very hard pressed to find as good a grip at this price level.  Tacki-Mac has been around for decades, they know how to make a grip.Is it a top-of-the-line grip?  No, but unless you are playing tournament golf, you probably will be super happy with these grips.  And if you are paying $8 to $10 a grip, you might just want to look into these.  They last just as long.  Very hard to beat this value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36P72OFKN4J0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C8C7U4W#wasThisHelpful","R36P72OFKN4J0R","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a morning player at a local muni, I was interested in hitting these.  I had used the Noodle Ice balls with similar covers and lost one in the morning fairway with that ""ice"" cover looking just like dew.  I knew where it landed, just could not find it.Same thing with these.  Colors are not bright enough, and after losing two on the fairways after just four holes, I put them away and got out some Callaways.  Never lost another ball the entire round.They hit just OK.

"This ball is a two-piece version of the Top Flite Gamer, which plays to rave reviews for distance, feel and soft compression.

"Bought this as an IDENTICAL unit from Academy under a different name.  Also cheaper from Academy...Pros:This puts out a huge amount of heat, around 58,000BTU's at full power.The pan and basket are somewhat thin aluminum, but campstove OK, and the handles are not bad.The base is wide, and very stable.Cons:The cheap cast burner is hard to get adjusted so it is not putting out blackened smoke with yellow flame. Only at full blast, usually too much heat, does the flame get the proper color.As soon as you open the package, throw away the thermometer, just toss it in the trash. Go buy a good one. (You might want to save the handy basket clip). I almost set peanut oil on fire with this thing. It said 325', threw in the fries, and the shaking of the fries made it jump to the relatively accurate temp, which was a little over 400'. Obviously in about 90 seconds I had burnt fries which were still raw in the middle.The regulator has most of the adjustment in the first 1/8th or 1/4 turn of the red dial. Just be aware that this will go hot very quickly.At this price point, you might think igniter.  You would be wrong.  Don't hold a match close to the burner when turning it on unless you want your hand burned. Either use a handheld butane lighter, or throw a lit match on top of the burner and then turn on the gas.Overall, for what I paid at Academy, I got what I thought I might get, a low end fryer for occasional use.  I paid about half what is asked here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V4Y7Q3F1R4J8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4FW2V4#wasThisHelpful","R3V4Y7Q3F1R4J8","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Found these locally and decided to try out a dozen since I've had fairly good results with other Noodles.  I am a 14-16 handicap on a local muni, 64 years old, lifelong golfer.Pros:  The nice red colored letters make your ball stand out among the others on the green.Cons:  These balls amplify your mishits so badly, I put them back into the bag after losing two in the woods and water on the first four holes of a recent round.  Lost no further balls, after going back to my Nikes.  I'm sure some guy at Taylor will say, ""Hey, this is the same ball as other Noodles!""  Maybe it was the red painted letters, who knows.

"Qualifications:  I am a lifelong golfer who is now 64, arthritic, bad knees, and my hand strength is maybe 65-70% of what it once was.  Been using 1/16"" oversized Tacki-Mac grips for years.  My distance has dropped from 250 yards ten years ago to maybe 210 on a decent day.  Needless to say, this puts a heavy pressure on my second shots, which have been my downfall.I found a set of Maltby Glider X irons in a used club shop with these grips on them.  Got the clubs for a dollar apiece.  No big deal, but the grips were the most comfortable I have ever used with this 1/8"" over.  It felt like I could now really ""hold the club like a live bird"", as Harvey Penick used to say.I played the Maltbys on a recent round, and found that they were easier to hit with these grips, unlike other heavy cavity back irons I sometimes use.(Older Bridgestone Precept Power Packs)  I hit it straighter, longer, and for the first time in years, hit a 4 iron a few times almost 200 yards and never felt the ball leave the face.I will be putting these on my hybrid irons I recently got.  I feel that the slightly heavier weight of the grip, along with the slightly heavier hybrid head should help balance the club and allow me to hit a little longer, straighter, and have more enjoyable rounds.  I am currently about a 14-16 handicap on a smaller muni, (6000 yards).UPDATE:  Added these to my Powerbilt EX-200 hybrid set of irons.  Fabulous addition for seniors and those with large hands or weak grip pressure.  Now my hybrid set plays even better.  And I do NOT suffer that old adage that bigger grips will amplify left and right hits. Wonderful grip for the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROUW778U4ZGVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LIUNKI#wasThisHelpful","ROUW778U4ZGVZ","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I believe this heater is identical inside to the same brand unit sold by Lowes, a Dyna Glo 23,000 BTU unit.  The Lowe's unit is black, this is painted white, but the engine would be identical.I've run kerosene heaters since the early 80's, and there IS a difference in how they run, smell, efficienty, etc.This unit is about at the top of the list for all of the above.The reasons are basically twofold.  The distance between the wick lifting mechanism, and the center stack that holds the wick to the lifting mechanisn.  If there is more room than needed, the wick can flutter and gain more oxygen, causing an uneven burn and shorten the lifespan of the wick.  It also smells more.  When the space is more precise, just enough for the wick, it only burns on the top of the wick, and the burn is much more controlled and stable, clean burningThis problem can also be caused by a poor, thin wick.  Any system will run poorly with a thin, cheap wick.  They all wick up the kerosene, but the cheaper wicks also allow too much air to invade places below the burn line, a bad situation that often causes carbon buildup, poor burn, irregular burn, and a hard to control flame.  The Dyna-Glo people seem to have this down pat.You SHOULD get a fairly even flame all around the flame deflector, and it should extend no more than 1/2-5/8"" above the flame deflector.So how do you know, going in when you've never bought one???You read reviews...If there are a lot of people satisfied with the flame, satisfied with the low smell level, satisfied with the run time, (poor spacing and poor wicks often burn faster than intended), you probably will be getting a good unit.This unit is in that class.I found mine in a pawn shop.  I had no intention on buying another.  I already have one very good one, and one of a dubious brand that I pulled out of a W--Mart that turned out to be not so good, but I use it in my woodshop, which has a lot of leaks to the outside air, like a really leaky garage door.  I bought this one as a third backup, and ended up using it as a primary in my house.  Clean, long burning, and I am totally satisfied as a person who has burnt kerosene for 30 years, on and off.It burns over 8 hours on a tank full, burns evenly, and the wick takes forever before it starts to get the carbon spots on top.  In other words, it is a great kerosene heater and I love it. Dyna-Glo is almost as good as the now defunct KeroSun heaters, (some old-timers in kerosene may remember), which were some of the best produced.I thought some others were OK, but Dyna-Glo is a much better, dependable heater you will not be sorry you bought.If you read the manual, pay attention to the 1-K kerosene you buy, (buy from a reputable source, not that no-name gas station down the street), you will be happy and warm.  Remember this is NOT a heater you should turn on and fall asleep for the night.  If you do intend to burn it overnight, be prepared to have one eye open all night.  Not that it is unsafe, but it is an open flame in your house.  I will burn mine overnight in really cold situations, (I have just a heatpump) but I don't get much sleep those nights as I keep getting up to check it.  It is always OK, but careful is how you stay out of the news.I also have forced air heat, and keep the circulation fan running to circulate the heat, and induce a little outside air, plus whatever the heatpump throws into the mix.  If I had heat that was stagnate, like radiators or baseboard, I would never run one of these without cracking at least one or two windows one inch.  You need to move some air.But as far as this type of heat is concerned, Dyna-Glo is a great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PRCUC446RNJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FF9I7G#wasThisHelpful","R1PRCUC446RNJ5","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently had a snap cold spell in my home in the South.  I had not burned kerosene in my house for years, only using kerosene successfully in my woodshop.  A recent cold spell had me scurrying for another heater, and I found this one.What it does well:1.  It puts out a HUGE amount of heat.  Most people with 2000-2500 sq. ft. homes will be amazed at the amount of heat, and how it will move that heat around the house.2.  If you have forced air heat, this is a wonder.  By turning on just the air, you might be able to heat your house with only the fan.  In severe situations, (say below 30'), if you have a heatpump you will be able to let it run and this will make a wonderful addition that will cause the heatpump to cycle on and off with this on. (Avoiding the dreaded aux electric heaters and saving a lot of money)3.  Smell is minimal if you learn how to adjust the wick.  Mine came with the wick installed a bit high.  I could not get the needed 3/4"" non-soot flame even at the minimal setting.  A simple take-apart and slight haircut of the wick, (about 1/8"") was all I needed to get it so it would run in the proper zone as described in the manual.  You have to have a bit of understanding of these units, but the technology has not changed in over 25 years.  They just work...4.  It runs for hours and hours without running out of fuel.What is does poorly:1.  Mine triggers my up-to-date First Alert smoke alarm, even though I see no smoke, and detect no real smell. I can burn bacon to a crisp and cause a smoke cloud and my FA will not trigger - why my kerosene heater triggers it is beyond me.  It is not a CO2 alarm, so I just don't know.  I have a secondary CO2/Fire alarm by another company that does not go off, so I just disable the FA only.2.  It is rather hard to make it put out less than the whole 23,000BTU.  You will find this hard to run at say, 40'.  Better to let it set until you really need it, when your heatpump or other furnace is running hard.3.  It really likes CLEAN 1-K kerosene.  Make sure what you buy is good stuff.  I use a local supplier in my town, and only one.  Some others pawn off slightly cleaned diesel fuel as 1-K, not good.  If it looks like clear water going into your tank, you are probably OK. (Also not much smell on the raw fuel.)Overall, this is a pretty good heater.  Not as good as the old Kerosun heaters I used to have, but they are out of business.  You could do a lot worse.  For $130, this is a bargain in heat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9R171X5VM1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KKO33A#wasThisHelpful","R1O9R171X5VM1V","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is good:-Slow speed does not burn the beans.  You don't realize how much you burn them until you use one of these.-Consistent grind.  Unlike the faster blade and flat burr grinders, this does not make mush out of the beans, mixed in with your grind.  This produces a consistent grind.-Upper grinder removes so you can brush the remaining grind down the chute.  Not perfect, but close enough.-Unlike others, I did see just a tiny bit of static, but I keep my house at 45-50% humidity, and oddly, this problem seems to be somewhat bean specific.  Beans I buy out of a barrel at a local market with those wax coated paper bags seems to be MUCH worse than sealed bags of beans I buy.  Since there is so much good coffee out there, I simply stick to the sealed bag coffee.What is bad:-I almost immediately saw that the third finest grind on medium was a little too coarse for me.  When I turned it to the fourth setting, only one to the left, it got too fine.  Hmmm.  I try to leave it in the middle and it seems to work good, but this is definitely not an infinite setting machine.-The chute makes a 90' turn from the grinding area to the receiver.  If you do have static, this can somewhat clog and the little brush is not long enough to reach from the top to push them down into the receiver.  You have to take the receiver off and go in from the bottom, a messy affair.  I got a turkey baster brush which is about 5"" long and reaches into the chute nicely. Just look for a marinade baster with a brush in it at any local grocery or sporting store that stocks smoking supplies for meat smokers and such.-Although it is easy to clean, you cannot dry a portion of the top holder.  You must wait till this air dries to use the machine again.Overall, this makes a wonderful grind and produces a fabulous cup of coffee.  It is under $100 and well worth the money.  Just be aware of the usual little static and grinder to receiver problems.  I also use an inexpensive airtight container that I bought at a TJ Maxx that holds my grounds, enough for about 6 days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T9HJ2DSLO56P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AR7SY#wasThisHelpful","R3T9HJ2DSLO56P","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We were looking for a pump machine, after often running out of steam with our old tank unit.  We were not really ready to pay hundreds of dollars for a decent pump machine.  Walking through our Aldi's one day in the fall, (they sell the Crofton line of appliances in their grocery stores), we saw this for $39.99.  Thinking it could not be any good, we didn't buy it until we walked in about a week later and snagged one of the last two, marked down to $29.99.  They sold fast...All of the things said by other reviewers seem to be pretty correct, save our knob has not fallen off.  The pump steamer does take a couple of pumps to get rolling, but with a little patience, (15-20 seconds longer), it makes rich, deep foam with our usual 2% milk.  The bun warmer on top is a nice touch.  I thought the steamer stem was a little cheesy, but so far, it has held up well.  My wife makes the expresso and has no complaints save that cleaning is a little tough.We have a conical burr grinder, so we can grind our own expresso beans and this thing loves it.If you are lucky enough to have an Aldi's, you might want to consider waiting for them to stock this item again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37BL01HO9A6GZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002E2U7A0#wasThisHelpful","R37BL01HO9A6GZ","A3CR1EV98GQ87X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CR1EV98GQ87X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some people have used Rustoleum for years, and it almost always is some sort of enamel.  Not this.  This is a rather thin, fast drying lacquer that dries gloss, but simply haybales out of the nozzle, hence the ""2X"" term.I find that although it is much less money than say, an equivalent Deft or Valspar lacquer product, it is somewhat thinner and prone to runs.  I only use it when I have a flat surface to work with.  Vertical surfaces, plan on doing some sanding and recoating.It does put up a nice shine, but WILL NOT spray over enamel.

"So far so good. Sturdy metal frame construction covered in plastic so the pool does not get scratched.  The net is thick and heavy duty, I'd call it medium-fine mesh.

"I have another similar LED desk lamp. Same form factor, similar control, the difference is the LED light array is long and narrow, this if course is a larger diffuser panel.  I thought this would be basically the same, other than the light panel.  Wrong.  The other one is cool, but pretty light and flimsy, this one is rock solid.The control panel (4 soft touch buttons) control the temperature of the light, from very warm and orange to blue-ish and cool.  You can easily fine tune somewhere on the middle to get any type of light you want.  You could use this as a photo light for small objects in a studio.  The other two buttons control the brightness, with a lot of steps between dark and bright.  The light makes a faint buzzing sound when you've maxed out any control in any direction to let you know that is the limit.  Keep pushing the color temp button, when it is as cool or warm as it gets, it will buzz.  Same for brightness.You can turn the brightness down very low so it can be a faint reading or ambient light or you can blast it and light up a large desk area.The arm articulates on several axes, you can aim it where you need to at the angle that you want.The base is glossy piano black and heavy weight, the arm is black matte plastic.One small negative, is the power cord that plugs into the back does not seat securely, it has come loose and come out from just moving the lamp around- it lacks a firm snap in place, just kind of slides in there with a loose friction fit.I guess another is the color temperature buttons are backwards and counterintuitive.  Warmer light is always shown to the left on any illustration, cooler light to the right. That is how they fall on the color spectrum.  These buttons are backwards, the left one makes it cooler, the right one makes it warmer.  The cooler button has a little book icon, the warmer side has a cup of coffee icon. I guess that means, use bright light to read, use warm light to relax.Having two of these, one for each side of the desk would be the optimum set-up for someone who needs high quality diffused light that is completely controllable to do detail work, examine photographs or proofs under controlled light, etc.  2 of these plus a white backdrop would make a perfect desktop photo studio to photograph small parts, for product photography, selling things on eBay, etc.  The diffusion panel gives a perfect light for photography.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCRUAGSOAZNU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZPB7OC#wasThisHelpful","RCRUAGSOAZNU5","A3UKPBTB65LLH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKPBTB65LLH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Seems to be high quality stone, even and consistent.  Have used both sides for a variety of blades- woodworking chisels, wood planes, kitchen knives, all were sharpened and polished as I expected.

"Seems identical in every way to the OEM Canon battery.  Have not done an exhaustive test of capacity, but ti appears to last as long on a charge, maybe longer and performs the same.  Fit and finish (quality of the plastic. molding. shape, etc) is identical to OEM.  The camera's battery registration & tracking function recognizes it- sometimes aftermarket batteries can show up as ""non genuine"" in some devices and the internal software refuses to recognize it- I think the camera manufacturer does that to punish people for buying non-OEM accessories, but that is not the case here. It does contain the chip that has a serial number, so it plays well with Canon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL35CCU88TP7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DEHVC8#wasThisHelpful","RL35CCU88TP7J","A3UKPBTB65LLH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKPBTB65LLH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Works as expected, triggers the flash through the hot shoe connection and also through a PC cable connection.  The PC cable port is not threaded and does not screw in though, it just sits there & falls out pretty easily.  I'd have to use a non-threading PC cable or tape it in place.I use it with a Yonghuo 622c system to trigger my flash in a softbox remotely.  This optical trigger connects to the YN622c-TX, to trigger it in basic flash mode.  I shoot with a small point and shoot digital camera that does not have a hot shoe.  It has a built in flash that I set to it's lowest setting so it will not affect the exposure but will trigger this optical trigger, I place this optical trigger just outside of the frame next to the subject which triggers the YN622 wireless trigger, which triggers the speedflash in the softbox, I control the flash's output manually from the 622c-TX.  Of course I have a good DSLR that I use most of the time, but it is fun to use the small point and shoot camera to trigger the big studio lights and get professionally lit results with a light inexpensive camera.  I did this because I was bored on a weekend day, used Prime same day shipping to get it and had some fun that evening.

"A rugged well made tool that works very well.  Same hi vis yellow plastic and black rubber grips as Dewalt Tools.I really like the adjustability of it.  At full sensitivity, I get it within a few feet of a circuit or fluorescent light and it starts buzzing.  All the way down and it does not detect anything, so the range of adjustment is fantastic. I can dial it in so precisely that I can hold it on one side of an insulated wire and it will not go off, but when I move it to the other side of the wire (where the hot conductor is) it goes off.  That's accuracy to a few millimeters.Best way to use it is to calibrate it ahead of time.  Stick it in the hot side of an outlet, on a wire or conduit, hover it over a wall switch or outlet that you know is hot and adjust the knob until it buzzes, now it's ready to test the unknown circuit.I live in a 60+ year old house with plaster and chicken wire lathe wall construction.  At a little more than 1/2 sensitivity it detects the wires inside the wall, inside of metal conduit.  By moving it back and forth and seeing where the buzzing starts and stops, I can trace exactly where that wire is in the wall between the studs.  Makes it easy to trace or detect wiring in the walls before I cut or drill through.If you will only use one of these to stick into outlets or against wires to see if they are hot then the adjustability feature may be overkill, but to get a lot of varied use, I'l glad I chose this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JHFR427JBID2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GLAC5G#wasThisHelpful","R3JHFR427JBID2","A3UKPBTB65LLH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKPBTB65LLH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has a fast set-up and dry time similar to Titebond red but it is waterproof like Titebond green.It has a thicker consistency than any of the Titebond glues because it has fine wood fibers mixed into it, much the same way you'd add chopped fiberglass or carbon fiber powder to epoxy resin to make it thicker and stronger and also fill gaps better.The thicker consistency helps minimize dripping.  Projects that I've used it on seem to be bonded very very strongly as you'd expect with any modern wood glue, ""stronger than the wood it's bonding"".Very fast set up time means that I only use it for small or simple projects, anything with a complex glue up or multiple parts, much better to use Titebond 2 or 3 for the increased open time.I see this as a good replacement for Titebond 1 (red) because it sets up just as fast, but I think that it's stronger (those wood fibers) and it's waterproof so you can use it for outside projects.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK62G10AMAABE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004I4158A#wasThisHelpful","RK62G10AMAABE","A3UKPBTB65LLH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKPBTB65LLH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As others have noted, this is not really 2 on- and 2 off-levers.  Technically it is, but the green on-lever only works with the 100 series Intermatic timers and the silver on-lever works with the others, so depending on which timer you have, you will use either the green on-lever OR the silver on-lever, but not both.  Therefore in practical terms, it is ONE on-lever (that you can use) and two off-levers.  Not sure why they package it that way, if you only have one on-lever, you only need one off-lever, so the other one is extra and useless, unless you lose the first one and needed a spare.No doubt it is less expensive for Intermatic to package them that way.That small rant aside, they are OEM Intermatic levers and include the small thumb screws as pictured.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GBTX2655NL6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BW3ELO#wasThisHelpful","R3GBTX2655NL6X","A3UKPBTB65LLH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKPBTB65LLH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dielectric grease as you'd expect. Similar appearance, feel and thickness as petroleum jelly.  I think some people think that you use dielectric grease to increase conductivity in circuits.  It has the opposite effect.  Dielectric means that it slows or stops the flow of electrons.  The purpose is to keep unsealed wires and connectors from getting corroded when exposed to the elements.  The dielectric keeps oxidation or galvanic corrosion from occurring.  That oxidation or corrosion could eventually case the circuit to fail, so dielectric grease has the effect of preserving electrical connections.It is also a waterproofer to keep the circuit dry and a lubricant to help fit connectors together (like sliding a tight spark plug wire over the spark plug).A little goes a long way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHYFJFGND1R0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AL8VD2#wasThisHelpful","RHYFJFGND1R0E","A3UKPBTB65LLH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKPBTB65LLH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4 stars because of the price.One of the big box hardware stores (the orange one) sells 2 versions of the same outdoor flood light- one LED, one halogen.  Both are the same, very rugged- cast metal, waterproof, with bare wires, you have to install in a weather proof junction box.  The LED version is expensive and also too bright for use in my garden.  Halogen bulbs suck a lot of electricity and have a short lifespan because of the heat they generate.I bought the halogen version of that light (very inexpensive) and replaced the bulb with this LED version.  Wound up much cheaper overall than the LED version, puts out just the right amount of light to illuminate my trees from below and uses very little electricity.  Time will tell the longevity.  With LEDs, you spend the money up front, then the electricity to run them is basically free so they pay for themselves over time.Now that I proved that it works well with one, I'll buy more to gently light up the back yard.These bulbs seem to put out the equivalent of a 25 watt incandescent.  I bought the warm white version and it looks identical to a halogen or incandescent. 2700k I'd guess.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R93WLB5X1R1DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9WE4T8#wasThisHelpful","R93WLB5X1R1DG","A3UKPBTB65LLH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKPBTB65LLH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great price on this OEM Samsung cover.Best feature is that the phone snaps into this cover- you remove the existing rear battery cover from the phone and snap this on instead, it retains the waterproof quality of the phone. If the phone comes loose from the back cover at all, it senses it and you get a warning message telling you to be sure the phone is attached so it stays waterproof.  That's a cool feature.  The cover is made of a stiff material so it offers great protection.  The clear plastic window seems to be made of scratch resistant material because mine does not have a single scratch in it.  It does hold and show finger smudges though.The case also hangs over the edge of the phone a little, so that offers edge protection.  You could probably drop it on the corner and it would survive, but best practice is don't be a klutz and don't drop it.When you attach it to your phone, the phone knows this cover is attached, so a specific display shows thorough the window- you can set the background image and choose which information is shown.  You can access the camera and take smaller images with the same square view that you see through the cover- convenient for snapping an image to use as the background in the window.  You can also answer and speak on the phone with the cover closed.  I might be imagining things, but it seems that the phone's earpiece volume is louder when the cover is closed than open.One thing that I dislike about other cases that I've had is that they cover up the microphone hole to some degree so speaker phone functionality is diminished- I use speakerphone a lot.  This cover does not cover the mic at all, so the speaker phone works as if it had no cover.The S5 is a fantastic phone, this cover makes it that much better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7RKR4JSQI9JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ITI22OC#wasThisHelpful","R7RKR4JSQI9JP","A3UKPBTB65LLH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKPBTB65LLH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Replaced a well used, leaking larger Hayward in-line filter that came with my house when I bought it.  It leaked but I liked it, I was going to replace it with the same model but I saw this smaller one.The larger ones have a nylon net that traps smaller particles, this one has a molded basket with larger holes.  I was not keen on losing the ability to trap smaller particles in the basket pre-filter before they get to the DE filter.  Cleaning the DE filter is a PITA, I like to put that off as long as possible.Do a search here on Amazon for Hair Nets, select the one labeled as the #1 seller and see my review of using a nylon hairnet as a pool basket filter enhancer from 2013.  Since I left that review, several others have posted similar reviews so others must have taken my advice.  Great news is, those hair nets work in this Hayward filter as well- I stretch a hairnet over the molded filter basket and it catches fine stuff that the Kreepy Krauley sucks up, including dirt and sand that get blown in during storms.  Just had a few days of heavy rain and the bottom of the pool was covered in dead earth worms.  Would not want them to get into the DE filter because they would rot and foul the water, luckily the combination of Hayward in-line filter and basket with the inexpensive hair net trapped them fine so I could throw them in the trash.So, I've replaced the functionality of the larger filter with a smaller, less obtrusive and less expensive one that is every bit as durable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SR8DO94ZA5DT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EW6EGI#wasThisHelpful","R3SR8DO94ZA5DT","A3UKPBTB65LLH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKPBTB65LLH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice, relatively light weight tool with variable speed and plenty of power.  Has the ""dead man"" switch on it, when you release your grip, it shuts off.  This is probably better for intermittent work- if you were running the tool for long sessions you'd probably want the kind of switch that stays on until you turn it off to lessen fatigue, but that kind is considerably less safe.

"Some of these Dial soaps are so powerfully perfumed that I can not be in the same room with them for days after I open a new bar.  These have a nice natural fragrance that does not blast you out.

"Real OEM wheel locks.  High quality chrome plated. I never understood how these things offered security, I always assumed that the key was the same for all of them- if the crook had a lugnut key, they could steal any wheels with these locks.  That's not the case though, each set is custom laser cut with a unique key pattern.Here's another tidbit- these locks also fit the 2015 Santa Fe Sport, which is what I bought them for.  Those OEM wheels are expensive!!  I cross referenced the part number at another web site.  The seating surface that tightens against the wheel is the same as the stock lug nuts.

"This is the standard workhorse light.  I had an old one in the pool when I bought the house, the bulb burned out so I took it apart to replace it.  It kept leaking water into the housing even though I used a new gasket.  Finally determined that the epoxy that seals the cord entrance and the rear of the light fixture had cracked and was letting water in.  Light was at least 10 years old, maybe more.The install of this one was easy in theory, though fishing the cord up to the switch at the pool pump proved very very difficult because it was very old and corroded and involved a jackhammer, concrete removal and an electrician to replace that rotted conduit buried in the pool deck.  Luckily I'm building a concrete block wall and had the concrete truck here that day anyway, so I just had the guy fill the trench in for free with the extra concrete he had on the truck.  Had it not been for that, it would have taken 30 minutes tops to install it.300 watt unit is fine for my 18,000 gallon pool though I'm researching dimmer options for it for those late night skinny dipping parties when I don't want to give my neighbors a show.The other option of course is LED, but there is a large price penalty.  You have to do the math to see how long the payback is for the savings in electricity. For me it was many years because I don't use it that much so the incandescent unit (costs about $.05 her hour in electricity to run) was the better option.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCFBY6Y35WU10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002FQJ256#wasThisHelpful","RCFBY6Y35WU10","A3UKPBTB65LLH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKPBTB65LLH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Always some problem with these freaking lithium batteries.  Most of the time they are counterfeit and have well below the published capacity, or they are listed as having overcharge/ undercharge protection and don't, or that kind of nonsense.  I've opened up 18650 batteries to find a tiny cell inside surrounded by a lot of air, with a fraction of the capacity that was stated. Of about a dozen of these kinds of batteries that I've bought, only 2 of them were legit.When these batteries arrived I had hoped to have a trouble free experience.  They are very heavy and solid which leads me to believe that they are filled with lithium and not air.  They had the little holographic seal in them, though what does that really mean?  If you have the technology to counterfeit a high tech battery, then you can produce some holographic stickers pretty easily.  Those holographic stickers are meaningless.Anyway, these batteries showed good promise, I connected them to the smart charger and charged them one at a time so I could check the capacity.  Charged at 1 amp for a nice slow, full charge.  First battery arrived with voltage of 3.6 and took 1200mAh of charge.  Second was 3.8 and took 2500mAh.  When I put the third one on, I got a low voltage warning from the charger and it would not charge it.  I set the charger at the LiFe setting which charges at 3.3v and it took it.  I do this with cells that are under voltage to ""fool"" the charger into charging them.  After a minute, I changed the charger's setting to Li-Ion at 3.7v and it took the charge starting at 3.5 v.Looking closer at the 3 batteries that came in this package, two of them have a button top, one has a flat top and is about 1mm thicker.Jeez, C'mon!!!  What is it with these freaking batteries?  They are never what you order, they are odd sizes, they are inconsistent, some are under charged, 3 batteries in the same package from the same supplier have different specs and configuration.Once all 3 are charged, I'll edit this review to see how they work in the big flashlight, also once they're depleted, I'll do a full discharge/ recharge cycle with the smart charger to see what their real capacity is.

"This is a pretty case, well made, fits the phone like a glove and I really like the look of it;  Let's face it, it is designed to make your S5 look more like a big iPhone.  Similar metal like case around the outside.Another BIG plus, is that the main on/off sleep/ wake button on the right edge of the phone, built into the case works perfectly.  Adds very little resistance to the pressing action which is great because I use that button a lot.  Molded TPU cases with that button molded into the side of the case add a LOT of resistance so you really have to push the button much harder to get it to work, with those cases on.What I'm not psyched about, is that it makes an already big phone, even bigger.  Of course any case adds to the size of the phone, but this really does.  I had this cover on for a week or two when I first got the phone, got used to it, then took it off and was amazed at how thin, light and svelte this phone is without that case.  Second, because it is in two parts, it is kind of a production to get it on and off, so if I need to change the battery or plug it in to my large car charger and need to remove the case, it adds time to the process.  The outer plastic ring has to fit into a channel in the black silicone part of the case perfectly so you have to spend extra time working it into the groove with your fingers. By comparison, I bought a Tech 21 impact mesh TPU case that, like any molded TPU case, pops on and off in a couple of seconds and offers excellent protection for the phone and adds less bulk than the Spigen case.Without a doubt though, this Spigen case looks fantastic, very classy and is perfectly made.  I use the TPU case for everyday, going to work use where I need solid, basic protection for the phone and the ability to pop the cover on and off.  On the weekend, out socializing etc where I want my phone to look great, I use the Spigen case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q27HUV783KII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3UWHX2#wasThisHelpful","R1Q27HUV783KII","A3UKPBTB65LLH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKPBTB65LLH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works as it is supposed to.  Apparently the Jandy tanks have a non-standard proprietary thread and thread size so if you want to add a valve or drain lines, you have to buy this adaptor to screw into the drain valve at the bottom of the tank.I have a Jandy DEL48 filter, I re-plumbed the pump and filter assembly and am building a new shed to house it.  That puts the drain valve at the rear where it would be hard to reach.  I use this connector to plumb in a valve on the side so I can reach it to drain the tank.Does not say it above, but the slip end of this fits 1 1/2 inch, standard schedule 40 PVC pipe.It is a very well built piece, very heavy duty, no complaints but I knocked a star off because of the price.  I buy quality PVC fittings for between $.99 each and $2.00 (if they have threads, etc).  Even the 1 1/2"" valve that I used for this system, which is a far more engineered, complicated, materials intensive piece cost $9.99 at the plumbing supply.  Why on earth should this simple fitting with a silicone o-ring cost this much (with a list price of $30.00?!!!!!!)  Because Jandy chose to use a non-standard thread, so you have to buy this one, so they can charge you this much for a fitting that would otherwise cost about $2.00.

"I'm coming from a galaxy Nexus mounted on a Samsung dash mount to an S5 mounted with this. Nexus is a smaller phone, and the Samsung mount is VERY strong.  The result, is that my Nexus did not move or jiggle one bit when in the mount in the car.  Rock solid, did not move.  With this mount, it's like jelly.  Obviously a smaller, thinner mount with a heavier phone, but it is very distracting.  I live in a big city, all paved roads, no bumpy dirt roads etc but it almost gets to the point that I can't see the GPS screen.So, you get what you pay for, now as always.  The samsung big $$ mount was rock solid and completely stable, this one jiggles and wiggles to the point that sometimes you can barely see the screen.  I drive a lot for work, use the GPS and phone constantly for hours a day, I need a mount that holds the phone still.  This is not it.Otherwise, the spring grip part works well, you need two hands to spread it and fit the phone in.  The suction cup seems solid.

"This is a tiny light, I did not realize how small.  Maybe 2"" square or less.  Packs in 36 LED emitters.  It is a heck of a deal though- consider this:  It comes with lithium ion battery and charger, the battery included is not some off-brand junk, it is a Fuji Film branded NP-45.  These batteries sell for about $14 by themselves here on Amazon, a little less if you buy a no-name.I was just shopping here to buy a second battery for it and when I realized the cost of the battery, a light went on (pardon the pun)- just buy an entire new light kit, with battery and charger for $14.95.  You'd pay that for the battery alone, so it's like getting a second light and charger for free!  Having that second light off on an angle helps to remove shadows cast by one light alone.I use this and similar lights for food photography.  The tiny size and ability to mount on a tripod or hot shoe (or double sided tape on the wall, hand held, etc) allows me to stick it anywhere for a little fill light, though it is certainly bright enough to be the main light source.If it lasts, it'll be a huge score.

"Small in size, fairly light, works well for smaller surfaces and projects.  Has enough power that you can use coarse belts and bear down pretty hard removing a lot of material quickly and it won't bog too badly.  Belt changes are very easy and it has a knob on the side that you can screw in or out to change belt alignment on the fly.Downsides are, first, that it runs pretty hot.  After a few short minutes of working it hard, it gets almost too hot to hold.  I'm not a wimp, I have a high tolerance for heat, but it gets hot.  Also, it is fairly flexible so when you bear down the rollers flex which changes the belt angle, causing it to move to one side or the other.  You can counteract that by turning the knob, but as soon as you stop bearing down, the belt goes in the other direction.  Best way to use it is not to bear down, just let it skim the surface.Finally, dust extraction is poor.  I connect it to my dust extraction hose which draws well, but the space between the dust outlet and the rear of the belt is very narrow so air flow is very low, so it is hard for the dust to get sucked out.Overall I would not consider it a high grade professional woodworking tool, more like a light job or hobbyist tool.  I've done some big projects with it and worked it pretty hard, it shows no signs of wearing out or slowing down.  I received mine as a ""freebie"" add-on when I bought the big Triton router.  The Triton router is a very well made, heavy duty well engineered brute, different in that regard from the palm sander.Takes 2 1/2 x 16"" belts, available here on Amazon in varying qualities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ33J5FWMV014/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATZKUYM#wasThisHelpful","RQ33J5FWMV014","A3UKPBTB65LLH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKPBTB65LLH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They do not go into my ear canal as far.These scrunch down and go into your ear, then expand- aka memory foam. Not so firm that they hurt your ears, just enough to isolate and keep them in.  Highly recommended to use these instead of the silicone ones that you see more often.These have the small plastic tube in them to attach firmly to the driver in your earbud and keep them from collapsing, but do not have the anti-earwax screens which seem pretty useless to me.

"I was talked into getting a jug of this at my local brick-and-mortar chain pool supply just after I bought a house with a pool.  The salesperson assured me that it would solve and prevent most common pool chemistry related problems I'd encounter.  I somehow felt that the salesperson was selling me snake oil and I was skeptical.  Former owners of the house left me the pool with a bad algae infection and troubled water chemistry so I wanted to try it.This did not kill the algae and clear it up- using algaecide and shocking it a few times did, but this has kept it from coming back in over a year.  I rarely have to adjust pH (I've used less than 2 gallons of acid in a year in 17,000 gallons), I add a few large tabs of chlorine to the floater every few weeks (maintain under 5ppm) and that's it.  Chemistry is stable and when I get the water tested, the phosphate levels are barely detectable, despite a lot of trees around the pool constantly dropping vegetation in there.  Clear water, clean pool, no algae, reduced chemical use compared to what friends with pools use.  As well, I do detect that the water has a ""silky soft"" feel that is hard to describe until you feel it.I add it to the skimmer ever other week with the pump running on high speed to mix it up, that seems to work well for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SB53ZNHVI090/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFGK88M#wasThisHelpful","R3SB53ZNHVI090","A3UKPBTB65LLH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKPBTB65LLH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mankind started out as hunter gatherer and nomads. Moving place to place with tier animals it would take a god many a years before they settled down into sedentary farmers. With the establishment of civilizations along such rivers as the Nile, Indus River, Mesopotamia and others mankind was getting exposed to more and more pathogens. This was cause by lower amounts of protein in the diet an higher carbs for one. But also with people being so close together and the fact that people knew very little about hygiene it would come as no surprise that diseases could wipe out entire populations. Also the close proximity to animals and their manure also brought about the increase of sickness.Since man has been plagued by sickness and disease, man has tried to find cures for what was ailing him. Many thought that the gods were upset and so they sent a sickness to punish the man or society. Gradually their healing techniques would become more scientific based and less mystical. At first healing techniques were thought to come from the spirit world and shamans would go into a trance to find out cures for all that ailed the tribe. Most healing relied upon herbs and natural remedies but the ancients did in fact employ surgery.  Paleopatholigist, people who study ancient diseases and their treatment have been able to determine how people died and what treatments were used. Trephiniation or making the hole in the skull was one such example.Bodies that have been preserved in bogs and mummies have presented the best specimens for archaeologists to examine. The first group of people discussed was the Egyptians.  They did not know much about the body but they did know about herbs.and how they could be used to heal people. Surgery was not done regularly and the dead body was never allowed to be dissected for medical reason or autopsies. They could submerge a body in the river and as the water eroded away the skin the doctors could see what was going one. The most qualified doctors  were taught in the temple‚Äôs medical school.The next group discussed were the Chinese. They believed that the body was composed of five main elements. Fire, Water, wood, earth and metal. They has to be in a balance in for  their to be health. The main emphasis was on the holistic balance between the yin and the yang. The whole body has to be strong.The Ancient Indians were also discussed, They  believe in moderation and right living. They would use herbs to help the body. They used yoga to regulate and nourish the mind and the body. Ayuvedic medicine was based on restoring a balance. The Indians believed in prana or energy. Much like the Chinese belief in qui. The Greeks held belief in good diet and exercise plus the balancing out of humors in the body. The Romans were to emphasis bathing and hospitals. From the era Hippocrates and Galen were best known.

"This is definitely a tribute to the dark ones. definitely not a fluffy safe version of the craft and this is definitely not Wicca. THe author is a student of many traditions and he pulls from such sources as Traditional British Witchcraft , Voudou, Hoodoo, Goetia, Santeria and perhaps several others that I may have missed . The rending is poetic and inspirational , a reading that will definitely transport you to the Emerald Castle in the North. I should be as poetic.In the early days mankind was close to nature and it's spirit aligned with that of the forest. Taboos against sex were not yet instituted by the all powerful Christian Church , which enclosed the continent of Europe in a bloody grip fog terror in order to force upon it the ways of the cardinal and church fathers. After Christianity became established anything that was wild and free was considered dangerous and evil. Instead of everything being thought of as one it was not a dichotomy of good and evil something which they defined. THe witch saw everything as interconnected and the more connecting a goal to a thing the more likely it was about to manifest. The gods of old were equated with the devil or other demons. Such inspiration for the devil came from HErmes, Baal and Mithras. But really who is the devil? Are Satan and Lucifer the same entity.? Some would say yes and others would say no. Satan means opposer while Lucifer was a light bringer. Light bringers such as Prometheus often brought knowledge to mankind, often at great cost to †themselves. THe author covers this much in depth.Discussions go into the nature of the dark goddess and her many faces. Lilith, Hecate, Circe are all discussed as well as wondering in the night ffor it is from darkness that hidden knowledge is revealed and our unmanifest desires become manifest. Fairies, Jinn and other spiritual creatures are discussed as is their interaction with mankind. What is the3 nature of these beings? Read and find out. As the question as to what makes ¬†a witch is discussed there is talk of faerie blood and human spirit interaction in the creation of witch blood. THe book has some recipes and several rituals.FOr those wishing toi pursue the old traditional craft this is one good book to have in your collections.

"Wicca was introduced to the world by Gerald Gardner since then it has grown and new traditions have sprung up around it. This has given some rise to debate. The debate stems over new practices versus old practices. Traditional Wiccans don‚Äôt change much and look askance at some of the new practices. Check out some of the book and websites the debate is raging. This book covers the debate and does a thorough job to boot. Some of the ground is covered in other such books as Drawing Down the Moon and Triumph of the Moon.While Traditional Wiccans may keep to the way Gardner has done it, the Innovative Witches are putting together their own tradition and practice. This has some unique causes and consequences. Let us look at causes. Most innovative will study books and pull their practice form those books. They may also pull from different strains of witchcraft and other religions to put their practice together . Innovative ¬†may also just come up with stuff from Unverified personal Gnosis. Let us not forget that public lectures, workshops and rituals are now becoming the norm as opposed to traditional covens. Take a look at witchvox and the number o books available. Some Tradtional Wiccans have crossed the line and become Innovative Witches.Finding covens is rather hard, so if you cannot join a coven you have to learn this stuff and practice this stuff on your own. That means if a witch or wannabe wants to practice the craft they will not have access to the coven initiation. Some options they may pursue are self dedication, or self initiation. ¬†How valid these self initiations are remains a hot burning controversy.The increase in Innovative Witches has led to some profound changes in the craft. One of several differences revolves around the Wiccan Rede which states harm ye none. Not all the Innovative buy into this. Many feel that if someone harms you or means you harm then it is ok to use magic against them that may harm them. Another difference is in the tools. Innovative which are more flexible in which tools they use an do not use. One controversial tool is the scourge. While it has been used in the past, many are denouncing it‚Äôs use because the tool could be abusive. This attitude is permeating the Traditional Wiccans as well. The Five Fold Kiss an the great right are not so up their either. It is too explicit especially for ¬†public rituals.There are similarities though. Both groups are challenging the feminist view of history that has been taught, especially with the exaggerated accounts of the Burning Times which put the death toll at 9 million when the number was really much smaller and many of those killed were not even witches. Another historic item that is challenged is the view that humans were once matriarchal and worshipped one Goddess. The lack of solid proof and academic enquiry has lead less to believe in this.Thanks to ¬†innovations witchcraft has become more accepting of gays, same sex coven and the craft has politicized around issues of human rights and the environment..

"What's in a face you say? Perhaps plenty. Looking at the features of someones face could tell you lots about them. Are they nice?kind? mean? dependent? or Independent? THe Chinese used to look at the face the way gypsies used to look at your hand in order to tell what your futre and fortune would be like. Jean Haner, Feng Shui specialist, married into a chinese family and learned this stuff. Obviously she cleaned it up to make it more in tune with the times and more realistic. In other words a lot of the superstitions were thrown out.THis book was basically written so you could look at your face and tell exactly who you are. You can also look at the face of other people and tell what they are like. A bit of modern wisdom is thrown in where in the author tells people to compare faces to the same racial types to get an accurate reading. She also tells us that we are all different and approach things rather differently,that is cool seeing that all of us are different. ¬†We must be true to ourselves and allow others to be true to themselves.Now I cannot go to deeply into details but I can cover a few basics and if this seems like a book you would like then by all means check it out from the library or buy it. First off Chinese philosophy or medicine is based on 5 elements. Those elements are water, wood,fire, earth and metal. We all have a bit of each in us at least. Some of us are strong in a few and weak in others. Most of us will fit into a certain type though.Water personalities tend to be more dreamy and enjoy their sleep . Water hangs around in the caverns below Earth and it flows in the seas and river. It is a soft hidden power. People like this often like to sleep late and enjoy theirr dreams and tend to be rather creative. To read water features you would look at the Ears, hairline, forehead, under eye area, philtum and chin.Wood personalities are the doer. They get up on time and are always actice on some project or other. They tend to be rather industrious. To read someone's wood features you would look at the eyebrows, browbone, temples,jaw and stature.FIre people are those who lie to be in the limelight and have very showy personalities. They tend to be rather excitable and even bubbly in terms of personality. To read someones fire features you would look at their eyes, types of hair and tips of features.¬†Your Earth folks tend to be very nurturing and friendly. They are ¬†quick with hugs and if you visit their house they will have some milk and cookies for you. They tend to be very helpful and tend to want to do good. To read someones earth features you would look at their mouth, upper eyelids, bridge of nose, area above the upper lip, lower cheeks near the mouth.Metal folks tennd to be the ones who refine things. They also like to stay to themselves and need their personal space and boundaries. To read someones metal you would look at their nose, cheeks, Fa Lin ines, eyelids and upper brow plus any moles.THE face be divided into two or three different zones. THe right zone is where we place or public persona, the left side our hidden parts. If you do the three zones then recall that the top part is our analytical zone, the middle zone is our practical zone and the bottom is our emotive zone.I found the book to be quite entertaining and author quite knowledgeable. I found out a bit about myself and will find such information useful in dealing with other peoople. Because if you want to help or work with others yu have to be able to read them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R6XG9ET4KE9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401917550#wasThisHelpful","R2R6XG9ET4KE9A","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The term Martial Arts normally conjures up visions of Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris or some other practitioner of Asian Martial Arts. The terms is usually applied to Karate, Judo, Kung Fu etc. Martial means war and it comes from ¬†the Roman God of War Mars. Now If I were to say Nigel Pennick you would most likely think of witchcraft and magic. Well now you have an occultist writing books on European Martial Arts.¬†This book provides real enjoyable read that is both informative and exhilarating. I read through the book rather quickly and learned several things I might not have known and ti top it ¬†off it was written in a way that is easy to comprehend and ¬†easy to retain the information.¬†The first part of the book covers the metaphysical underpinning of the European Martial Arts. Man was considered a microcosm of the universe. His body was supposedly consisted of four humors and when these humors got out of balance wee then that is when we got sick. Face reading was also covered . This was based primarily on Greek philosophical knowledge.¬†The author takes us to the age of a hunter gatherer where men hunted sometimes more than they needed. Heroes or super hunters would slay wild animals or pack of wild animals that were guilty of making things difficult for mankind. ¬†From this evolved the hero warrior. Also hunting cults developed from this as well.¬†Cults dedicated to Odin would live out in the wilderness and hunt or harass enemies in packs. These people were your ulfredrs or wolf hunters. By donning the wolf skin they could take on the characteristics of the wolf. Wolves operated in packs. Berserkers were bear warriors who operated alone. There were also boar warriors and dog warriors. Oft times the skin was believed to be magically warded against swords.¬†As the fighters became Christianized they lost their connection to nature and adopted the code of chivalry. The code of chivalry obligated the night to behave in a courteous manner, be kin to women and stick up for the weak. The book discussed ¬†the process of a young nombe boy becoming ¬†knight.¬†There was also a preview of the different shields, swords and other weapons the knights used to use. There is some discussion on how they trained. After the intervention of gunpowder and the end of the use of bow and arrow the interst I warrior arts waned. After all any fool could pull a bloody trigger.¬†Over all if you are interested in the history of European martial arts or learning the techniques of such this book may at best be a primer or a good place to begin. I am not sure any bone pagan groups used all the things he describes. After all the heathen Norse mst likely did not know too much about Greek medicine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R159E0LQTR93FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1861631537#wasThisHelpful","R159E0LQTR93FS","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don Webb is a magus of the Left Hand Path, an official in the Temple of Set. I have read some of his earlier works and was quite impressed with his erudition. The meat of this current work is the examination of Crowleys great revelation ""THE Book of Law"" . Now many ¬†Thelemites have told me that Crowley would not discuss the book of law because it was written for each and every single one of us and it is a revelation meant fort each invidual that reads it. Don Webb has written his own commentary on and has published Michael Aquino's commentary on it as well. At first I found the work somewhat questionablee because I am not so sure how much either of these authors spent in either the Golden Dawn, Order of Thelema or Ordo Templis Orientalis.I know Anton Lavey did not nor did Michael Aquino. No less Aleister Crowley influence the entire generation. No Crowley no sixties quite literally. Crowley's influence went well beyond the occult world. ¬†There has been question has to whether Crowley was a right hand path person or a left hand path person. Crowley wanted one with diety, yet he said he did not want followers or slave but he wanted an army of strong individuals to spread the word he also told people not to blindly rely on him but to come up with their own revelation.Find their own revelations many people did. Gerald Gardner the father of the Witchcraft revival was a member of OTO and worked a lot with Crowley. But Crowley also influenced Anton Lavey, Timothy LEary, L Ron Hubbard, Jack Parsons, Kenneth Grant, and slew of writer and other great thinker. His students did blaze their own trail and thanks to Crowley's inspiration a whole new Aeon was ushered.The Aeons of Isis and Osiris are over with and it is now the aeon of Horus.traveling thorough Egypt in 1904 Crowley and his wife Rose held a ritual where in Crowley came into contact with Aiwass and wote down his revelation. Finding a steelae he named the main god and goddess Nuit and Hadit, next to them was Hrous.THE Aepon of Horus is likened to the age of Aquarious where man is free from societal restraint to pursue his will and live in accordance with the desires of his soul. Recall that every man and woman is a star meant to live out its destiny while at the same time being respectful of the other stars out there in the sky.In addition to commentaries Webb informs the reader of the influences of Crowley. His father was a member of the austere ""Plymouth Bretheren"" they had a strong work ethic and were strict. Crowley's mother called him the great beast and he went on to live up to that title. Crowley was also influenced by far eastern religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Tantra and Nietze. remember Nietze believed in thee will to power and Crowley was about will. ¬†After the commentaries the author discuses several philosophical under pinning of Crowley's philosophy.Be honest I liked most of the book with the exception of the commentaries . I felt that they did not increase my understanding all that much. The first part of the book and the last part were features of the book that saved it or redeemed it. ¬†Whether you are an occultist or not you may have something to learn from Crowley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13A4TY296D01X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620551896#wasThisHelpful","R13A4TY296D01X","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For countless centuries the Middle East has been home to a variety of religions that do not fall into the mainstream. People will find it hard to believe that non Muslim minorities could survive so long in the Middle East. Fact of the matter is that the Muslim Middle East was more tolerant than Christian Europe . That does not mean that life was easy for non Muslims in the Middle East, as these minorities have undergone persecution. ¬†Islam bespeaks tolerance and protection for people of the book ie Christians, Jews and sometimes Zoroastrians and Samaritans. Many of these minorioities survived by hiding out in hard to reach places like high mountains or marshlands. These minorities have also been tenacious.Now things are changing. In ancient times the Muslim governments did not wish to route out followers of other faiths, after all Muslims profited from the extra jizya tax. THe Muslim governments did not have the power to get at people in those hard to reach places. Now they do. While life in the past was relatively stable, modern times has proven lots more precarious.In Iraq you have the Mandaeans and Yazidis. ¬†THe author Gerard Russel is a British Diplomat who decided to travel and visit these people who are holding out and clinging to their traditions. In the south he visited the Mandaeans. THe Mandaean liv e in the sourthern marshland of Iraq and Iran. Thanks to blind fanaticism and the fact the that the marshlands are no longer a safe haven, many of the Iraqi Mandaeans have let their native Iraq. The faith of the Mandaeans is a gnostic faith. This means that the material world was created by an evil deity meant to imprison souls. THe Mandaeans hold that they are descended from Seth , Adam's third son. John the baptist is the Messiah and Jesus was a rebel against the order. They are most known for having baptisms for every occasion and their sign is a cross dressed in a white sheet. ¬†The white sheet stands for purity and the cross symbolized four directions. THe evil Goddess Rouha created the world to trap souls. Mandaean thought had an impact on Manicheism.¬†THE second group in Iraq live in the Northern part of the country. Many live in Sinjar, while others live in Qunitra. In the past the Yzidi have been much left alone. Now things have changed with the onslaught of ISIS. Many have fled to Lalish the place ¬†where a founding member is buried. Many do not know the fundamentals of ¬†their faith. There is a learned group and an unlearned group. Most Yezidis fall into the unlearned group. Yezidis have been thought of as devil worshipper. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Much like earlier legends, Satan or Melek Taus, was God's head angel. The head angel loved god but refused to bow down to man. For that he was flung into Hell.But while in Hell he repented. His tears quelled the fires from Hell. He tasted redemmpfion and he rules the the world. AS GODS¬† lieutenant he is revered along with the sun and the moon. It is believed that there were 7 peacock made only two survive.¬†THe third group takes us to Iran, coincidentally enough to the Iranian city of Yazid. This is the central place ¬†of their faith. Their number are in decline because of increased persecution. Zoroastrianism was the official¬†Iranian religion prior to accepting Islam. ¬†Islam had a debate as to ¬†whether Zoroastrians were people of the book. While maintaining a belief in monotheism they do believe in a dualistic world. Ahura Mazda is the god of life and light while Angra Mainyu was the evil god always going against him. It should worthy of note that all thrtee faiths discussed thus far read the stars and allow their dead to be eaten ¬†by birds before being buried.The next two groups have a presence in Israel. They are the Druze and the Samaritans. ¬†The Druze live in three countries and they are Lebanon, Syria and Israel. On principal they fight for the county they live in. Druze get a lot of their ideas from Pthagoras. They believe in the Universal mind which gave rise to the Universal Soul and Intelligence. THey also believe in reincarnation and that all Druze will bve born into the body of another Druze. Sometimes they have souls that go to ¬†China. Much like the Yazidi ¬†they have two groups of people, the learned and the unlearned. The Druze religion is not a very demanding religion.The Samaritans live in Colon, Israel and in the Palestinian city of Nablus upon the hill of mount Gerizim. THe Samaritan are very similiar to Jews. In fact they claim to be remnants of the Lost Tribes of Israel left over from the Assyrian conquest. THe Jews in the past have thought that they were descended from settlers transferred to Northern Israel by the Assyrians. THe two groups have not always gotten along and in New Testament times they were at each others throats. ¬†THe Talmud says contradictory things about the Samaritans. Now relation are improving and the Samaritans might be a bridge between the Palestinians and the Israeli Jews. But Samaritan number are dwindling. IN terms of history it is only recently that they ¬†have allowed wives from outside the community to convert into ¬†the Samaritan society. Every year at Passover tourists flock to ¬†the Samaritan celebration.Lately ¬†the Samaritans have opened up even more. Now they are putting out literature for those who want to live the Samaritan way. This may help bolster their decreasing numbers. I ¬†think they should allow men to convert into their community for marriage just like they do for the women.THe final two groups that the author visited are the Copts and the Kalasha. The Copts are located in Egypt and were introduced to Christianity via the apostle MArk. For centuries they were tolerated but recent history has shown that things are turning against them. unbar Pasha increased many of their opportunities and allowed for ¬†them to have positions in the government. This pretty much happened under King Farouk. With the over throw of Farouk the era f Sadat was ushered in .Under his leadership the Muslims brotherhood got increased power. This was bad for ¬†the copts. Increased fanatical presence on university campus has led to aN ISLAMIFICATION of curriculum. Christianity is not taught at all. Also it has been harder since Sadat to build neddw churches or repair ¬†the older ones. under Mubarak things went on like before with few improvement . Mubark still worked ¬†with the Brotherhood. Since things have gotten bad many Copts ¬†have choses to get closer to the church . It must not be forgotten that Muslims and CHristians ¬† helped overthrow Mubarak and that Muslims and Christians formed human chains to prevent the destruction of CHurches. in the ¬†south the fanatics are a lot more ruthless. Then again the Copts are more numerous in the South and have the ability to fight back.The Kalasha live in the Hindu Kush mountain bordering in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. They worship old gods from Pagan times. they have solsticee celebrations for Spring and and Winter as do ¬†the Zoroastrians. The author arrived in the winter. The Kalasha have their pantheon o0f gods and they get on with their Muslim ¬†neighbors. Like many Middle Eastern groups women during their ¬†menstruation have stay separated .There are also laws that demand ritual ¬†purity that only they can do.THe book finished in Detroit where in discussion venters on how emigres ¬†from the Middle East are coping. Many do not know their religion so it is hard to maintain the faith. assimilation is a problem and each group is trying to come to grips with it. Many Christians find that they are befriending and even marrying Jews. Several Palestinians have. In a lll this is a timely work. It does not include all of ¬†the minorities in the Middle East. A good book to complement this work is ""Minorities in the Middle East"" by Mordechai Nissan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AAPEWD1PAXHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465030564#wasThisHelpful","R2AAPEWD1PAXHE","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"would hesitate to call this book a classic that will be remembered for generation to come, yet this work has several redeeming features. The first feature that stands out is that the author has done extensive research in oder to write this book and there is a rather extensive bibliography at the end of the book for those who wish to do further research. ¬†I found that there was lots of information on Ancient Herbs the way the Egyptians use them. There is also extensive information on life in the Egyptian Temples. One gets a good insight into what life was like in Ancient Egypt.The core characters are real people as well. King Seti was an actual Egyptian pharoaqh, Bentreshy was a devotee to Isis in the city of Abydos. When the story jumps into modern times Dorothy is a real person and she wrote several books. None the less this is a fictional account of their lives with several incidents put in to fill the blanks. THe main characters of the story are Bentreshy and Dorothy and both in this story are incarnations of the same soul.What the this tale lacks is a story structure. IT comes off as being a diary of a soul that has been twice incarnated . There is no rising action, or climax in the story.THere is a setting, time and place clearly indicated. Despite the lack of plot you will find yourself glued to the book or reading device just waiting for what comes next.Bentreshy is the daughter of an Egyptian soldier, who sends her to the temple of Isis as he can no longer properly care for her. In the temple she learns the healing arts of Egyptian herbs, spells of Isis and beauty secrets of Ancient Egyptians. While she grows up in the temple she befriends Nubiti, a songstress, Kebi, a snake charmer and Inhapi a healer. While growing up in the temple she witnesses the mummification of her friend, interacts with Anubis and deals with a sadistic priest. Later she becomes a dedicant to Isis and does not marry, yet she meets King Seti who is definitely not married.¬†Dorothy her incarnation in modern times lives through world war I. Her interest in Egypt sets her apart from all the other British children her age. Starting with an accident when she ¬†was young, Dorothy exhibit strange behavior and has visions of ancient Egypt. In her quest to learn more about Egypt she devours books on the subject and learns how to read hieroglyphics. Her skills in Egyptology lead her to a museum which houses relics from Egypt. Together with E . Wallis Budge, a famous scholar, they translate documents and make awesome discoveries. THe world war and Egyptian bombing leads her to the country side. To make a long story short her destiny will lead her back to Egypt.IF Egypt is your thing then this ¬†book is for you to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PJ6AS0XV156C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088JB9GO#wasThisHelpful","R3PJ6AS0XV156C","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What comes off as a book dedicated to Ghanesha turns out to be be more about the over all picture of Tantra. THe first sections of the book are definitely about Ghanesha but the book later veers into the legends of Ghanesha and then turns into the history of Tantra. At the end there are some notes on politics within the different organizations spreading the word of tantra.First thing to consider is the definition of Tantra. Tantra are basically religious texts from both Hinduism and Buddhism which places a value on carnal knowledge or gnosis obtained through whole body sensation. Sadhana is the practice of Tantra. THe practice has five main exercises. THen first is a the matra where in a typical phrase is repeated over and over again. Words have power. Mandala or Yantra is a holy design set up behind the alter. It represent the deity. Good tool to focus on. Mudra are hand gestures. Nyasa is the installing of diety power into their mandala. Dhyana is meditation. Puja are physical rituals. Lat but not least ios Diksha which is being initiated into an order. Tantra speaks of liberation through the breaks of social taboos. Tantra contains magic for results and and for personal betterment.There are schools of tantric though that maybe available in the west. Among them are AMOOKOS which brings over traditional tantric practices but also realized that the system was highly compatible with the working of Crowley. There is also the International Order of Naths. There are five schools in the far east.To effectively practice Tantra one must be initiated. Which is where the two previous organizations come in. THe book outlines some practices that one could do on their own in the mean time. Practices like praying to Ghanesh or certain mediations like creating your own astral temple. THer are also some ritual samples.Tantra according to the author are the religious praqctices of the Indian population prior to the coming of the Hindu Aryan. THe ARayan were warrior who over road India bringing with them their religion. At the outset Hindus venerated warriors. Later things would morph into being more priest centered. The demons of Tantra were the Gods of the previous siciety. Vrious ¬†lingustic proofs can attest to this.Ghanesh has two legends surrrounding him. Firswt he was created by Shakti. Acting as a guard she gets his head severed. Shiva finds him another one donated by an elephant.Another version has him being born of Shiva and Shakti. A magician states at Ghanesh and kills him. An elepjhant head is used to revive him. Ghjanesh is a god for money and removing obstacle.The book over all is rather good. The authorr gives to the reader an over all good view if history and background in an easy to understand format. Some of the working are good as well and will give the beginner something to work with both as a sample and as a tide over until initiation. I did not like the last part about the politics of the International Order of Naths and AMOOKOS. I do not care for politics when reading spirituality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYTVRT6PKBER9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ZOJB4O#wasThisHelpful","RYTVRT6PKBER9","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THey used to be numerous in pre victorian Britain, but now they are not even a handful if they are around at all. Owen Davies has written several well informed books on Witchcraft and Grimoires , several of which I have reviewed. This is also the only other book that I am aware of that deals with the cunning folk on a scholarly level that is available to the modern day reader. Emma Wilby ¬†has a another one out which I have reviewed. The two authors cover the same subject but I would say from different vantage points. Owen cover the social integration of Cuhnning folk while Emma Wilby covers the inner spiritual working to an extent.The Cunning Folk were called upon in Old Britain to counter witchcraft . They were also called upon to find lost or stolen goods, to win love and to find treasure. Records of them go back all the way to like the 1400's but they may have been around long before that,they just went by a different name. Wicce was one of those name and it meant wise ones .THe Cunning Folk have always hovered around a grey area in society. Not completely trusted and not completely loved. When suspected witches were being rounded up the cunning folk were left alone. After all it was the cunning folk or white witches who fought against the witches. Yet many church officials did not like the cunning folk because after all they did use magic. In fact the Chrurch despised them even more. Calling themselves white witches gave them a disguises and they were just trickier servants of the devil whther they realized it or not.When the legal maelstrom hit the fan the cunning folk were not entirely immune. They could not be punished ihn secular courts of law but they did receive flogging and banishment from church courts on occasions. They were also sued in civil courts. Their claims of who stole whose property often times did not pan out and this caused social problems. THe wrongly accused would sue them for slander. Oft times their cures did not work and those they accused of witchcraft turned out not to be witches.Later on when laws were promulgated against using magic to find treasure, often ment that cunning folk could find themselves in a bit of a bind especially when there was non treasure to be found. I personally think that many a cunning folk used fraudulent means to drum up business. Often times though they had other careers beside being cunning folk. Which of the two careers generated more income well that is up for grabs. Back i old times it was pretty difficult to distinguish between an astrologer, doctor or cunning man.Cunning folk collected grimoires and displayed them on their shelves. this made them look educated. THey usually were not so ceremonials but they did employ bits and pieces taken from Ceremonial magic book. Written charms were oft tiimes written up and sealed with wax. Kept on the person of benefit for no one else to see they were often times sewn up in clothing . THe written charms had biblical verses and invocations from Grimoires.¬†Compared to other cunning type folks in other parts of Europe penalties against cunning folk ¬†wer mild. Now it must noted that it is ann open question as to whether true cunning folk still exist. THere are neo pangs out there who are trying to revive things. But bear in mind Cunning folk were not pagans they were Christians. THeir use died out well because who really is looking for buried treasure? Who is being curesed by witches? If you are sick you go to the doctor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R389JXRXO9FCNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=184725036X#wasThisHelpful","R389JXRXO9FCNS","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Perhaps we should ask ourselves , who loves demons more the Church or the witches ? It was during the end of Medieval times that the Church was having a crisis in faith. Many were questioning the reality of the spiritual world. The only way it seemed to sustain belief was to hunt out demons. The proof of demon meant proof of the spiritual world. When the Church could not answer questions then what could prove to be a better scapegoat then the devil himself or his demons.The churches view of Demons, Witchcraft and women went on a continuum. Going from less extreme to the more extreme as science became more advanced. Interviewing witches and asking them about demons was the church's way of gaining insight into the other world spiritual reality. Demon at first were thought of strictly as being with a body made of another substance, a spiritual substance. There was no way it could interact directly with the earthly plane. They did not have solid bodies. Of course they could possess people but that was rare. They could also possess animals. As time went by the demons, or church members , found other ways the demons could interact with our plane. Some said that it was entering into the human imagination, later on they could materialize bodies by collecting different particles but it was not a real body. toward the end of the burning times They did in fact have a body of their own. Demons came from the name Daimon which was an intermediary between the gods and men. So demons became a more solid reality as time went by.At first it was believed that demon could not mate with humans but then as time went by the demons could make their own body and steal denial fluids from a man and use it to impregnate a †woman. Finally it came down demons being able to procreate with human beings. This was all gleaned from church father interviews with suspected witches. Might we keep in mind that torutre was used and often times the church fathers themselves added details of their own imagination .The witches sabbat was another witchcraft demon thing that got blown out of proportion. At first there was not a single mention of it. Later on witches were able to fly in their mind to meeting rot a sabbat. Things always got more elaborate . legend abound about a flying ointment that made witches cirtually able to fly through the air. ¬†At the first it was thought that demons tranported them or used transvection. ¬†Legend than stated that witches themselves flew there. Scientific experimentation revealed that the witches never even left the area when they anointed themselves and the witch hunters stood watch. THe witch hunters of course made some excuse as to why the witches did not fly on that particular occasion and the belief of the sabbat stuck.The subject of witchcraft itself was not so bad. At worst it was thought that maybe someone of a week mind would engage in such practice. Many church fathers thought that witchcraft did not even work. Later on it would a ssume a much more siinister meaning. ¬†In the beginning men and women would be accused of witchcraft and then things centered on the women. The witch hunts got more anti female.Witches were also thought to have killed children to obtain their power. This was achieved by turning into ¬†cat or a wolf sneaking into a house and drinking a babies blood. Dead baby fat was supposedly used for an ointment that gave witches more power. They would also use illusions to stamp out male viritilty. If someone could not conceive a witch was to be blamed.¬†As we see witches like Jews, alternative Christian sects and witches proved to be excellent scape goats. ¬†If something went wrong you know who to blame. If chidden die mysteriously then you know who's fault it was. All these groups were accused of dancing naked for the devil. All the groups were accused of stealing sacrament and using it's power for negative magic. After all baptism and other sacrament meant that one had god's protection from demons unless a human agent got involved, be it ¬†Jew, witch or heretic.The Church needs to the devil in order to survive. Without it no onee would be afraid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H2P24U3YQILA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226772624#wasThisHelpful","R1H2P24U3YQILA","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Part two of a rather dated two volume work. Where as the first book covered the history and archaeology of the pre historic Finns as well as their biology and prevailing customs of the time. This book goes straight into the meat of ¬†the matter and discusses the songs used in order to invoke magic. This book has more value for the anthropologist studying up ion the subject mater then it does for the aspiring magician or someone who really wants to practice magic. Not many modern practitioners will have read this work, buit they may want to.The current work in no way shape or form mentions anything about what herbs they used in conjunctions with the songs nor was there any mention of candles. So one can assume that the songs were sung just as they were in regards to the situation at hand. However, you might be able to add to it.This book is definitely not Wiccan.Most of the songs invoke old Finnish deities along with Jesus, his Mother Mary and a few angels. For many these song spells will not address modern day needs. There are no money spells and there is very little cursing of enemies. Plenty of the songs deal with helping crops grow, protecting those crops and protecting farm animals. There are spells for healing burns, wounds and even such maladies as pleurisy and pneumonia. ¬†After several of the ¬†song spells there are origin stories about everything under the sun andd then some. Most of the spells operate on a story telling motif. Guess this would be a use of sympathetic magic. The book relies on galdercraft which is spoken magic and stories do have their magical power.If baltic paganism is your thing or if you just want to study old magic system then this book might be worth c","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I3UDNLS6VFQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009M736BW#wasThisHelpful","R3I3UDNLS6VFQI","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here comes another set of tales originating from the desert sands of the Middle East. Written along the lines of 1001 Arabian Nights, comes a collection of 18 tales found in Istanbul. The stories were written in Arabic and may have been written before the Arabian Nights collection. ¬†The stories themselves were incomplete in certain cases. Prior to launching into the tales the author or translator gives a little bit of a painfully long scholarly dissertation that analyzes the stories you will read.The author/ translator notes that women are portrayed in a rather cunning trickster like manner . The Jews and Christians while having their religion as praised as decent are themselves written about in both positive and negative characteristics. Several of the stories feature Harun Hrashid , looking for a tale in Baghdad. He does drink and go about on his river boat in the Tigris and Euphrates River. Some of the tales feature beggars both as victims nd con men. Jinn feature larges in this set of tales as do travels by ship to islands on the Indian Ocean. Some of the tales take their travelers all the way to far out places like China and India.The first story talks about two kingdoms owned by the same king . His son travels to th second kingdom and finds himself imprisoned wrongly by the vizier. The vizier gets his just deserts when the prince is free. The second tale is about the son o a quadi who parties away his inheritance and has to sell his beloved slave girl to survive . Later he wants her back and goes through all manner of adventure to retrieve her. The third tale tell the plight of six unfortunate beggars and how the sultan redeems them for telling a tale. ¬†The strange stories go on and on.Several titles were missing and so they just use the first line of the story as a title. Almost all the stories strt with a prayer to Allah the most compassionate. While most of the stories had value and were entertaining some were really hard to follow sometimes switching scenarios with out warning and all of the sudden you are dealing with different characters and different scenes. The dampened my enjoyment of the tales. As all of you know giving a summary of a collection is rather tedious and difficult so if reading about the Jin and their world of the desert sand you may well find that this book is written for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZNJPG36W2N1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0141395036#wasThisHelpful","R1ZNJPG36W2N1G","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Magic with the Theban RunesNo one knows where the Theban Runes originated but they were used by Honorious to write a grimoire. The secret alphabet was meant to conceal from church authorities the real contents of the grimoire. The grimoire itself was compiled by  number of popes and magi. The grimoire itself consists of 7 book and 93 chapters. The book is meant to be passed down to a worthy successor. The complete work is not in tact but rather in bits of pieces.The book itself is simple in outlay. The first part consists of relaying the history. The second part informs the reader on the different types of spreads. The meat of the book deals with the symbols and their divinatory meaning. Connected to each symbol is a historical personage along with meaning and the meaning of the stone in reverse.The latter half of the book deals with some simple spells and the progresses into correspondences. Finally it covers cleansing and making your tools.The book is an easy pleasurable read that makes following the instructions rather easy. The spells are easy to perform and understand. What I am not sure of is how accurate the divinatory meanings are. There are good sources listed at the end and the author is well educated.

"The facts around Dracula, or Vlad the Impaler are scarce indeed with not much too go on for the researching scholar. Contrary to popular opinion Dracula was not a vampire, he was considered by some to be a brave warrior who fought for his people and his land. Others considered him a demon or a devil and that depended on whether you were friend or foe. Sir Jens who is a history buff rather then a scholar renders to the reader a good skeleton of Vladimir Dracula's life. There are no sources mentioned in the book, nor is there a bibliography which is a must for any book of research.There are a few not well known facts about Dracula's life or should ¬†I say family that are not mentioned in other works, at least which I have seen. Vlad's grandfather was a Viovode of Wallachia. Like his grandson he too would fight against the Turks and would in the end turn out paying tribute and sending Wallachian boys over to be Janniseries. THe grandfathers name was Mercia. Vladimir the second or Vlad Dracul ,me weaning Vlad the Devil, was Mercea's first son. A boy of a more diplomatic bent he was sent to be raised in HUngary far from the court intrigues of Tirgovaste , the cpaital of Wallachia. He learned the art of diplomacy an throughout the gift of tongue was able to resolve many disputes diplomatically and rendered such services to Hungary. Vald the second while belonging to the Orthodox Church, converted to Catholicsim and joined ""THe Order of the Dragon"" which was dedicated to preserving Christianity and fighting the Ottoman Empire. For practical purposes Vlad converted to Catholicism but returned tro the Orthodox Church upon assuming power with the Viavode of Wallachia. He paid tribute to the Ottoman's ¬†and one would say that he was the epitome of real politik. As a matter of policy and a show of loyalty to Murad the Second Vald Dracul left his son, Vladimir the Third and Radu.Vlad was born in the Hungarian town of Sighiousorsa in the year 1431. As hostages to the Ottomans they were raised as Ottoman. learning war and customs they were allowed to keep their ¬†religion. Life by and large was comfortable at the court although there are stories of cruelty . One was was that the boys could be used sexually. Vlad stayed their until 1448 and in hsi 17th year the Ottomans helped him reclaim his throne with a small force of Ottoman soldiers. His reign did not last long . Driven out by rival boyars , someone from the Danesti throne was put into power. For a good number of years he dwelt with his uncle Bogdan and son Stephan rulers of Moldovia. They did not hold to thir throne that long either . Seeking refuge in Hungary, Stephan would find refuge while Dracula's fate was more precarious, ¬†Janas Hunyadi was a powerful personage in Hungary and he had been the one for responsible fo the death of Dracula's father and older brother ¬†Mecrcea.¬†Yet it would be Janos Hunyadi that would be instrumental in helping Dracula reclaim his throne. First he allowed Dracula thje right or privilege to be the protector governor of Transylvania. Janos Hunyadi would later die of plague after holding the Sultan Moorad off from over taking Belgrade. This opened the way for Dracula to reclaim his throne.The reign of 1456 was his second and most noted reign. Must be noted that neither the Otoman's nor Hungary wanted Wallachia as that would be a border with the two empires. Better for both if they could install a puppet ruler who served their interests. Some of Vlad's achievement was the cowing of the Saxon Merchant towns who could sway the balance of things and hold undue influence in the Wallachian court. He also supposedly wiped out the Boyar ¬†as they were a destabilizing element and made thing rather turbulent. He also killed off all the beggars and indigent. Now how far he went is up for debate. His actions are compared to the death camps in Europe where undesriable were eliminated. He mentions Gypsies, handicapped and metally ill but he fails to mention that Jews were the main victims. What is with Sir Gens? What other important details did he leave out?THe second reign is when Dracula challenged the Sultan by refusing to pay tribute , torturing Ottoman emissaries and fighting the Turks as they came across the Danube. Ultimately Dracula lost and had to flee to Hungary while Radu too the throne. But there was a lot of back and forth. While in Hungary Dracula would be a political prisoner and get married. Eventually he did reclaim his thrown but only briefly. Having died in battle his hdedad was displayed in Ottoman Turkey.Vlad is ¬†both a hero and villain depending on your perspective.Catholic monks and Saxons vilified him. The Romanians look to him as a savior. Bram Stoker's novel ¬†did not help clarify things. I know that some of Sir Jens material is somewhat slanted and biased and I question hopw much research he has done.

"The Dragon PrinceSince the release of the movie ""Dracula :Untold"" the real story about Vladimir the Impaler has been slowly getting out. Yet this story like others does have him turning into a vampire at the end. Taking place circa 1450-the 1470's when Dracula's three reign s occurred in Wallachia, not Transylvania , as teh legend would have you believe. The story stick pretty close to the truth of what was going down historically.The Ottoman Empire, Hungary and the smaller states are set in war against each other with the little states choosing sides in ¬†greater battle while trying to maintain their independence as best they can. With in this greater conflict are several micro conflicts . The Orthodox church is vying for it's interest in Wallachia as are the aristocratic boyars, the kings and the Church. Dracula's rule is constantly being undermined and that is something that he will have to deal with. Not only is there a clash of religions but there is also a clash within religion. Islam vs Christianity, Orthodox Church versus the Roman Catholic Church. Different European powers competing against each other with some signing separate treaties with the Turks.Dracula was the second sone of Dracul. Growing up as a hostage in the Sultan Murad's court, Dracula finally returns to take his rightful crown. In a bloody seige against Tirgavoste, Dracula retakes his throne with the help of Turkish military. Upon conquest the Turks rape pillage and plunder the cityu much against Dracula's will but he cannot do anything about it. His hold over the kingdom does not last long. Joining up with relatives in Moldavia he fights on their side building up alliances and skill. He takes his kingdom back a second time.His second time is the most famous reign. It is when he cleans up the kingdom from vagabonds, greedy boyars and other internal enemies of state. THe second reign was when he stood up to the Turks and took the battle to them. Dracula ultimately failed and his brother took teh throne to run it for the turks. The third eeign was short live. Undone by treachery of allies more so then Turkish military might. Dracula is captured in the end and destine for his ultimate demise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25GBK9TEINV0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M51MPV4#wasThisHelpful","R25GBK9TEINV0I","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Blood of the IslesTracking genes is the next frontier in tracking the history of a people. Through the genetic mutations you can tell how long ago a groups clan mother came into existence as well as the clan father. Were talking thousands of years ago, if not millions. By tracking the genes you can tell who invaded a land , whether they settled in peacefully and the journey from where they began to the final point of arrival. It is more accurate then archaeology .Brian Sykes a , British genetist who studies bone disease has done extensive research on the origins of the populations now inhabiting the British Isles. He tacks the origins of the Irish, Scottish and British.. ¬†Using a variety of methods all the way from finding genetic material by drilling the teeth of specimens in tact and then comparing them to the populations the author makes some startling discoveries about the origins of the people of the Britsih isles and some of you might be surprised.One making this study one must bear in mind that there are certain caveats that must be observed when studying a group. The first one is the Gengis Khan effect. Ghengis Khan when he took over an area would murder the entire population of males and then impregnate all the attractive females. This was done no only by GEghis Khan but world world wide. Most of us probably come from descend from some brutal warlord The next thing toi keep in mind is that a groups mythology no matter how fantastical or non sense it may seem does contain a kernel of truth.Before lauching into discussion on the Genotyps tbhe author discsses some genetic information so you knbow how it is done . He discusses the history of studying blood types and measuring skull types ¬†on the isle. ¬†He gives a good lesson on how genetic information is read. In this work as his previous work he has female matriarch divided into 7 daughers of Eve and the men into 6 patriarch. In the end the ultimat stock is Celtic. The highest percentage of Celt being in Ireland.Before discussing the Genetic finding for each area on the British Isle he writes a chapter on the History of the area. The next chapter then discusses his sampling methods and finding. I have blown the ending a bit but there is lot more detail that I have left out.

"Well I literally thought that I had heard it all but this book was nothing but garbled Christians polemic with absolutely no scholarly value what so ever. The author has done no research and there are no worthwhile scholarly resources for the interested reader to go and look up.Well that is if you count religious sources .THe main thrust of this author's work is that spiritual Israel has inhabited or dwelt within three different nations. THe first ¬†nation to embody the Nation of Israel was the African or black people. There leader was Nimrod and he brought the Israelite faith all the way to Egypt where in the Israelites dwelt. Now we have heard that the first Israelites were black and coming from the Middle East they ¬†would have had to have been very dark. MANY Jews today have dark feature even the European ones. But in the authors view the Africans lost the right to Israelite nationhood based on the fact that they practices witchcraft and had hubris. A bit of raise is thrown in as he states that the Africans or lost in a permanent state of spiritual decay and cannot rise out of it due to their sin of witchcraft..THe seed then passed on to the sons of Jacob. Jacob as you know married Aesanat daughter of Potipher, an Egyptian priest. It was thorugh Ephraimmand Menasseh that the line carries on. THe line of Moses did not continue through his two sons because of there lack of righteousness . Rather it went thnrough Jsohua as he was considered married in a spiritual non physical way to Moses. The author goes on to say that Jacob unrightfully stole the blessing from Essau because he was convinced by his feminine spiritual nature to do so. He did gods will but in the wrong way.¬†There is somewhat of an intereting opinion on spirituality . The author claim that the feminine is stronger but less disciplined while the male half is not as strong but has more discipline. Later on the spiritual seed passed on through the church of christ which grafts many nations to its enormous tree turn. THe khazars are also considered legitimate ¬†Jews despite the fact that they are not true Israelits but converted no less.Do not waste your time with this book.I am giving it two stars. An extra star for some interesting thought on masculine and feminine spirituality .","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BAH0S6ZC6QB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MK7HNA6#wasThisHelpful","R1BAH0S6ZC6QB8","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A Tapestry of WitchesI have read several books by Aidan Kelley and read the history contained within these pages in more than one place. Of all these sources many I have given good recommendation to , this one is the exception.The history outlined or discussed is rather thread bare and missing many details that should have or could have been discussed. Instead you get a chronicle of events filled with dates and times thrown in your direction. The book is filled with member lists and coven lists and many of these might not even be functioning. something you will not remember after you close the pages of this book. The book is also very short as well. Half of the book is filled with list like appendices. I am glad I did not buy this book but rather lent it off the Kindle Library.The history the book gives over could be readily found in Margot Adler's Drawing Down the Moon and a few other work. THE book functions as a historical chronicle of the Witchcraft movement in the US. Much of the action takes place in California and the East Coast. It could also be noted that the population of Pagans doubles in size very two years. But as the author will tell you and this is something that I agree with witchcraft and Paganism are not the same thing in all cases. A statement ¬†I agree with.¬†Wicca came to AMerica in the early to mid sixties under the guidance of Raymond Buckland, who studied directly under Gerald Gardner. One of the strongpoints of this book is that gives a good history of pre Gardnerian witches in the States and they did not consider themselves pagan. Groups like the Russian witches of Los Angeles, the Feri Traidtion, Ozark Withces and the Church of all Worlds. That is just naming a few.Many of these groups have been highly influenced by Gardners system especially the use of casting the circle and calling quarters. Some of the groups did worship the lord and lady, some just the lady and others considered GOD to be female and male.THe book tells how the Pagan movement gradually slid from coven based to more group based and over all being more open to solitaires and self initiations. There is in depth history on New Reformed Order of the Golden Dawn and the Church of all Worlds.Good book to read from a lending library but not worth buying.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSV2QD6BCVWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1499192649#wasThisHelpful","RSV2QD6BCVWL","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Robert Lebling is bet known for his book on the Jinn ¬†called ""Legends of the Firespirits, which by the way is an excellent book on the Jinn that is well researched. This author has written numerous other books that were well written and well researched among them ""Natural Remedies of Arabia""This book called "" The Anomaly"" is his first written work of fiction. Now most often when authors of research based books write fiction it does not come out too well. This book is a nice showing. A fair amount of research went into the book and the man knows hisn stuff because he has lived and worked in ¬†Arabia. through out this work the reader is given several windows of observation into Arab culture and history. Even I learned a thing or two which is usually not the case with most fiction book.Not only does he include some information onn the Saudi Arabian culture and history but he has clearly studied his UFOlogy quite well. Interspersed thorugh out the story are references to actual UFO abductions. Of course now the latest thing is that the UFO's come from another species living on Earth, possible below the surface.The author also delves into multiple dimensions theory maintaining the Jinn live in a different dimension side by side with us but we cannot see them. They assume various guises to fool us. The latest ruse is that of UFO aliens. I sort of do not like mixing the genres but hey who am.The story starts off with a team exploring an oil field in Hima Arabia, bordering on Yemen and Oman. It is in Rub Al Kali or the empty quarter. At first people go missing and then some Aramco worker end up dead under mysterious circumstances . Security expert Dan Keller decides to investigate. The team has come across an anomaly over an oil field, it is an inverted pyramid. Seems the US, SAUDI Arabia and Iran are in on it too. Washington send AManda Goddard an expert on Middle Eastern mythology to investigate. Together these tow along with a Jinn and Frank Devereaux, scientist , go to investigate. They find a tunnel and go thorrugh some adventures before arriving to this impressive Jinn city. Along the way Iranian troops try to stop them , they are attacked by Jinn scorpions, snakes and bats, and Jinn suicide bomber. THere are renegade Jinn who do not want mankind and Jinn to meet up and they are aided by Quarmation, Shiite fanatics who once stole teh stone from Kaabah. Needless t5o say in the end they do meet up but the ultimate ending is surprise.It is about time the Jinn have their day in the fantasy literature realm and it seems that this is happening. Most authors are not as knowledgeable as Robert Lebling and he is an expert on the middle east. The story line is great or at least the premise is and as such it has great potential especially for a well written sequel. The story seems to be trying to decide if it is a Tom Clancy novel which is all about heavy Jinn involvement or if it is a fantasy story. Over all IK liked it and felt it was too quick a read.Now he could have made the book longer. By this I mean develope the story and flesh it out. develop the plot a bit more and develop the characters. Most beginning fiction writer need to work on dialogue an there were certain part of the story where I was not sure who was talking or whose scenario it was.The author could give us a little help.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRR4UTLNRVSE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1506094317#wasThisHelpful","RRR4UTLNRVSE9","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FOr those of you that hold an interest in the spirituality of the Proto-Indo-Europeans then this book will be the one for you to read. THe author is very knowledgeable about the different Pagan religion if Europe, such as the Norse. Celtic and even going further into the realms of the Hindus. All of these rate necessary for a work of this order because they are Indo_Europeans. From somewhere near Central Europe or along the Southern ¬†part of Russian, or near Armenia the proto-Indo-Europeans ¬†spread out practically all over the world. Going as far West as Europe and far East as India. If you examine these religions you will find out that they have much in common. after all they come from the same source.Many people are under the impression that old EUrope was a peaceful goddess worshipping place and that the Ino EUropeans who stormed into Europe were warlike horseback riders who worshipped male gods. Such talk is nonsense. Old Europe knew it's share of violence and wars. Not all Indo European culture was spread with the use of violence and war. In fact a lot of it spread through trade and people admiring their ways. There were also peaceful migrations where in the Indo -Europeans learned from their neighbors and their neighbors learned from them.Documents pertaining to the Indo Europeans and their rituals are scant and far and few between . This of course leads to an accurate as can be reconstructions, most likely pulled from Norse, Hindu and Celtic sources. THe book delves into the hisotry of the people, common laws and customs along with reconsructed rituals at the end. If going Indo-European is your thing or you need a good strong book on Pagan religions then this book is yours to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5V8S2W1VGM34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JF6RKXK#wasThisHelpful","R5V8S2W1VGM34","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Fire wish is the most potent of wishes a Jinn can wield. It involves stealing the power of another Jinn and using it to make your or their wish. This new fare from Amber Lough is a nice packed story filled with innocent romance and a good deal of action. ¬†A little blood is spilt but so what what. The young adults are getting a taste of the Jinn and I should say it is about time. Vampires and werewolves have had their fifteen minutes in the spotlight and so have the fairies so it is high time they move over and make way for the Jinn. I am not saying that this book will blow open the doors and make the Jinn famous but the story line would make for a great movie and a movie would blow things open for the Jinn.The story line is rather familiar, two girls who look alike but grew up in different areas but come together and switch places. The story will change both of their lives. Zayele is a human girl who grew up in the Northern Iraqi town of Zab is selected by Hashim, vizier of the Caliph, to marry Kamal a prince in Baghdad. Najwa is a Jinn girl who grew up in the caverns below the earth. She has an ability to travel through thee Earth and go past some anti Jinn wards and enter the palace of Baghdad. She is a member of the Eye of Ibls, a sort of Jinn spy agency. When she enters the palace she sees Kamal and falls in love. As Zayele travels down the Tigris river she catches a hold Najwa and makes a wish for them to trade places. This causes their lives to change. Najwa becomes more human and Zayele more Jinn.Good to note that the Jinn and mankind were at one time friends but events have soured the relation and now they are at war. Under Hashim's guidance Kamal is devising a weapon to wipe out the Jinn. Faisal on the other hand who is commander of the Jinn is about to find out what this secret weapon is . THat was Najwa's job. But Hashim is not such a good guy. In the end there is a conflict between human forces and Jinn forces and the lives of these gtwo girls will be changed for ever. Through the story they will learn about their connected past and their future paths aND LOVES WILL CHANGE..Amber Lough spent time in the Middle East, especially in Baharain and later went into the militiary serving in Iraq.THe internal operation of the Jiinn base ¬†is alot like a modern military base except that they use magical Jinn weapons instead of modern military weapons. For example Najwa has a tattoo on her hand that if she squeezed it will send an image to tthe eye of Iblis. Sound like James Bond but hey that is cool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15X32I7T1TUTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038536976X#wasThisHelpful","R15X32I7T1TUTM","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They lay waste to every town they come across that refuses to surrender. But it stops there and we return to Richard and Kahlan.

Along the way to the citadel they do meet with tragedy but you will have to read the book to find out.Once at the Citadel they find themselves trapped by occult powers only to be rescued by a new batch of mord sith. More tragedy ensues and I wonder how the author will ¬†continue this story after such an ending. If you like ¬†the works of ¬†this author then you will enjoy this installment.

"It is only recently that I have been exposed to the works of Lon Milo Duquette, and boy I am glad to have been introduced to his works. This work like the others is easy to read, witty and makes the arduous path of magic a whole lot easier to follow. Homemade magic is a gret read for both the beginner and the more advanced practitioner.Starting off with an introduction of a young California kid forced to move away from paradise to a boring backwater Nebraska, he teels about adjusting to new climes and meeting his future wife Candace. His description of himself I meant to inform us that only she could deal with a man like him. Baba Lon sure has a sense of humor. His life story goes through the sixties, his college life and musical career and tells about his initiation into the OTO.The first chapter or section gets the new practitioner initiated and makes the newbie ask some very essential questions about who they are. There is a lesson about coming up with your own magical motto. Now who we are is always changing,  we are constantly being reinitiated and we will always come up with new magical mottos.The book then moves into telling the magician how to get his magical weapon and how to consecrate them. You know the chalice, wand, sword, club and pentacle. To make them Lon‚Äôs way is the best and easiest way and for someone like me who is not that hands on and is a bit lazy this is the way to go.Lon then goes on to tell the neophyte how to turn his home into a lodge and how to make your own set of Tarot cards. THE best way to learn magic is to teach magic according to the master. He tells you some great books and then you have to read the stuff and learn it. There is no room for ego and always accept that you can be wrong. In making a magical  household there is away the challenge of raising the children. Of course they should be included to the extend that they can handle it and things should not be kept hidden or spooky. I like the way he tells the reader how to use the tarot card to make a magic circle. A bit detailed and will have to be read over. Take good note.Getting started in magic is difficult and things are not always what they seem. But getting the essentials and simplifying down to the important stuff eases the transition into magic. This is one book that I will use. Even if I do not use everything there are lots of things I will pull out and use. For example at the end he gives over Eliphas Levi‚Äôs invocation to the four directions. I will use that in may faerie workings. The Morning-Afternoon-evening salutions to the Egyptian deities is simple and easy to use. I plan on using it. His rites to Demeter are useful even if I end up modifying it to meet my own needs.Let me leave off with a few final things and maybe two. As a husband you know everything but your wife is always right. You know how tough marriages can be, especially between two magicians. Demons in human form who disrespect you for your flagrant flaws can really end up saving your life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ID8R4C6DFSOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LXD0JGS#wasThisHelpful","R1ID8R4C6DFSOP","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oppression of the Yemenite by Their Ashkenazi BrethrenIt was at the beginning of the nation state's history that almost the entire Jewish population of Yemen was airlifted to Israel in what was called ""operation magic carpet"". The story made front page and everyone thought they would live happily ever after. Unfortunately their was a very dark side to this ""In gathering of the Exiles"" thousands of babies were kidnapped or went missing depending on who your listen to.The Yemenite Jews complained but no one in the government listened. Today it is still open wound. A wound that will nOt heal until a proper investigation occurs and the truth is revealed. The obstacle to this revelation is the Istaeli govt.Yemenite author , shoshana madmoni Gerber, has investigated the Israeli government's cover up of this issue through the lenses of scholarly critique and a thorough analysis of how the Israeli government has historically treated the Jews from the Middle East.From the beginning Israel has maintained itself as a European country smack dab in the Middle East. Anything Arabic or Middle Eastern was deemed as primative and barbaric, that included Middle Eastern Jews. In order to reduce their dependency on local Palestinian labor the Ashkenazi Zionists imported Middle Eatern or Mizrachi Jews over as cheap labor.Once brought over the Muzrachim were doused with DDT and put into tin shacks, while Ashkenazi Jews were given better housing and living conditions. The Yemenites were traAted even worse. They were subject to physical abuse, theft of sacred objects and the kidnapping of their children. When they tried to make their voices heard the Israeli press was instrumental in silencing them.The press which is dominated by the goverenment portrays the Mizrachim as primitive and backward. The press created the impression that the Yemenites were unclean and did not care for their children , yet the opposite was true . They did care for their children and when they spoke up and took action against their plight the press and goverent made them seem like violen separatists bent on destroying national unity . Three inquiries were set up which could only ask questions yielded nothing.This is one of the greatest tragedies in Israel's history. Jews oppressing fellow Jews. A good documentation of Israel's real face one thT she tries to hide from the world .","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y3GIK2IXBYGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0230613462#wasThisHelpful","R2Y3GIK2IXBYGJ","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Druze of the Holy LandSituated in the north of what is recognized today as the Modern State of Israel, lies a community that is a minority within a minority. The Arabs are minorities in Israel and the Druze are a minority amongst the Arabs. Little is known about these hill dweller who have villages in the Carmel, Galilee and Golan. Their religion is secret even amongst themselves, their history though available to all is by and large unstudied. The Israeli Jews go up there for great deals, good food and warm hospitality. The Druze are known for the loyalty to the state. They serve in the Israeli Defense forces and have lost a high proportion of their numbers in the IDF defending the country, even a higher proportion then Israeli Jews do. The Druze believe in a concept of taqiyah which abides them to go along with the sovereign of where they live.Dr. Ruth Westheimer , noted author on many books on sex, has delved into this little known community with the help of Gil Sedan. Her research started off as a documentary which then turned into a book. She has a Jewish background and is both a survivor of the Holocaust and a veteran of the Jewish Haganah. Her book is very even handed and those who know nothing about the Druze will find this book to be both a light read and very informative. Not many are able to plumb into the depths of the community as she has.She covers several topics in this book such as relations to the state,religion , customs and more. As noted earlier the Druze are loyal to the state of residence, and there are Druze in Syria, Lebanon and Israel. Each Druze community is loyal to †the state and their own people.The Druze loyalty to Israel has put some friction between the Israeli Druze and the others. Yet they believe in loyalty to the Druze.Such a stance has alienated them from other Arabs.As for religion it is very secretive even amongst themselves. Most Druze are not religious in fact they have few rituals and very few religious commandments. Like Muslims they are to refrain from adultery, alcohol and smoking. Most of them though do smoke. The ones who know and study the religion are called the ""Wiseones"" and the ones who are the majority and secular are known as ""Ignorant ones"" When a Druze becomes observant they shave their head, grow a handlebar mustache and wear a turban like hat. In the Druze religion both men and women are deemed equal and both can become knowers of the religion.This equality extends onto other areas of life. Both can work and hold jobs and pursue education. A woman can also divorce a man as a man can divorce a woman. Once they are divorced however, there is no going back. The equality does not extend into all ¬†areas of life. While the Druze way may not include honor killings that are present in Arab culture it is still ¬†there. Both male and female druze are not allowed to marry outside of the community, For men the penalty would be banishment, loss of inheritance, children not part of ¬†the community and for a woman the penalty is death. The Druze have been known to carry out this penatly. This is followed more strictly in Israel then it is in Syria or Lebanon.THe religious extremist among the Druze have tried to limit womens freedom but have not been successful. They wanted women in the home and not be allowed to drive a car. The community did not listen. In Israel the Druze identity is more solid and reinforced then it is in other countries. In ARab countries they identify themselves as Arab while in Israel they are definitely Druze. As noted earlier the Druze are loyal ¬†to the state but that special relationship has been strained at times.While the Druze serve in the army, other ARab like Muslims and Christians go to university and get higher paying jobs. ¬†When the Druze leave the army they are often lagging behind in education and are often unemployed while their Christian and Muslim counterparts are working and building homes for their family. ¬†The Druze are often treated with both trust and mistrust and do not have the same opportunities as the Jews do. This has caused tension between the communities.The Jews and Druze have been allies since post World War 1. Yet the Druze are not treated equally and in many respects lose out. Another factor complicating things has been Israels favoritism of the Christians over the Druze when Israel invaded Lebanon. Some of the Druze revolted and joined the Lebanese Druze against Israel. Not all Druze identify with Israel some have identified with the Palestinian cause and have advocated against serving in the IDF.The Druze of the Golan are a different category, being Syrian citizens under Israeli occupation. After the 1967 war they found themselves under Israeli rule and at first they availed themselves of the many opportunities it provided them. Yet when Israel returned the Sinai desert to the Egyptian they started becoming more Syrian. The author makes it like thhey appreciate living in Israel but if the land is ever returned to Syria they will be asked why they were so cozy with the Israelis.Another interesting aspect of their religion is the belief in reinacarnation. They believe that after they die they will be born into another Druze body and this is something that they believe strongly. They have stories of memories andd of knowing people form past lives.The book gives a brief sketch of their over all history, on how they came to live in Israel and a bit more in depth view of their relationship with Israel. If you wish to learn more about the Druze this is a good place to start.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O4WVQMC55YYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590561023#wasThisHelpful","R2O4WVQMC55YYI","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scott Cunningham most noted for his works on Wicca and witchcraft had spent considerable time in Hawaii and became enamored with the culture. What follows is an informative easy to read book that gives the reader insight into some of the ways of Hawaii's spirituality. At best the book An in depth overview that could leave one hungering for more. Fortunately for those with more than a passing interest there is a nice sized bibliography in the back .While much of Hawaiian spirituality may have been lost with the coming of Christian missionaries there is still plenty that remains. I am willing to wager that Scott Cunningham knew more then what he put in the pages and the potential magician may have found a world view that he or she can apply to their magic but the book is sparse I magical techniques. Still it provides a very enjoyable and informative read.Some of the subjects discussed are the history of the Hawaiian people and their deities. Most known is Pele but there are others and they are known as the akua. The amakua are the deified ancencestors Hawiian families. Sometimes the Amakua take in animal forms or simply appear to guide their descendants. Kapu were prohibitions or taboos. If a certain families amakua came back as sharks it would be forbidden fir that family to eat sharks. Not all the deceased became amakua. Some ghosts found their way to the after life by finding to right cliff to dive off of. Those that did not find their way remained to haunt others and steal their food ,Chiefs were called Ulii and were considered to have possessed more mana then regular people . People did not defile their shadow and oft time prostrated themselves before the chief. The chief like others had their clothing guarded so sorcerers could not curse them . On fact every one protected their cothing. Kahunas were priests or experts. Beneath them were prophets. After that were the common folk .The Hawaiians believed that everything possessed mana or life energy. Different types of people had differnt types as did plants, animals and stones.The book discussed some sacrifice to the gods for different thing. It also discussed magical uses for stones and plants. The lunar month and important days was elaborated upon and the astrology was touched upon.The book serves as a nice introduction into Hawaiian spirituality .","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR5JHVPUJ6YN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1567181996#wasThisHelpful","RR5JHVPUJ6YN3","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Interesting diary of how working the Abramelin working over a period of several months altered and changed the life of the author. The working was done over a nine month period and the author like most of us had to interact with the secular/mundane world.Like most of us we could not just retire from the world and do our working,so modifications had to be made. While doing this working the author noted many changes in his world that affected both him and his family members. Having to do operations and prayer andd meditation along with fasts tended to make one feel somewhat disconnected from reality. The working brings about change and confusion. Dreams are effected as well as the author was flooded with memories and very strange dream that often times invovled religious experience both Pagan and monotheistic. His family member were also visited by dreams and sometimes even nightmares. In the physical world things would begin to knock over, cats would hiss and the family would hear strange sounds both day and night.What is the purpose of the Abramelin working you might ask? The purpose is conversation and contact with your holy guardian angel. Contact with your angel changes your reality. It brings you enlihgtenment and disorientation. The results are worth it but In will add my own caveat. Such a working should probably be done under some contact of guidance of an actual physical mentor or teacher. The book does not give any in depth ritual steps or incense recipes and on the surface of things it gives you a rather cursory glance.For me the book opened up several doorways. First off it is reconnecting me to the deep spiritual tradition of Western Mysticism. This includes Sufi, Kabballah and Christian mysticism. There is some deep stuff there that any magical worker should not ignore. There are also references to several awesome books to read for further investigation. I may never do the working in my life time but I did pull out several things that could assist me in developing my spiritual practice. I will most likeley include them in a longer review included on my blog  granovitch.blogspot.com. I gave this book 4/5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I5DSFEAL7SCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XTJ0PA#wasThisHelpful","R1I5DSFEAL7SCJ","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The SilmarrillionThis is the story of how the world was created. Illuvatar was the one and only god. From him came the Ainur, sort of like gods or angels who served under Illuvatar. With the Ainur, Illuvatar made music.THis music would create the world and the universe. Our world was called Arda. Now there was was one glitch in the system. Melkor, sort of like the Bible's Lucifer, went into a rebellion and strove to corrupt thing.He disrupted Illuvatar's song several time. Once Arda was created several of the Ainur went down to govern it. Those Ainur who went down to Arda were called the Valar.What follows is a tale that spans across all three ages of elves, the fourth age belonging to man. THe book tells how Melkor destroyed the works of Illuvatar and how the Valar had to fight him. THe first time Melkor was subdued by Tulkas and chained in the halls of Mandos Lord of the Underworld. It was around this time that the elves were first born at Cuiven. They woke up and say the stars and from that point on revered Elberteth Gilthoniel, consort to Manwe who is head of the Valar. Orome went to guide them to Valinor. Some elves stayed behind under the sway of Melkor and these are called Dark Elves or Avari. Those that followed are called Eldalie. THey that arrived in Valinor were divivided into three tribes. Ingve led the Vanyar, who were most loyal to the Valar. Next were the Noldoli who were builder and crafters like Aulie, crafter of the Valar. Finally there were the Teleri, the boat builders.Aftr Melkor served his time and was released he did not give up his evil schemes. he seduced the Nildoli and convinced them to rebel ¬†against the Valar. WIth the Help of Ungoliant he also destroyed the two saced trees of Valinor and stole the Silmarrillion. The Silmarrillion were three jewels crafted from the light of the trees. After Melkor stole them, the sons of Finwe, rulers of the Noldoli went after him.Second age tells how Melkor fought against the elves and how he dominated Middle Earth. It tells how Thingol met Luthien and formed a kingdom in Doriath. His wife, Melian was of the Maia, which are a little less in power then the Valar. THese two have a cheld named Luthien. She falls for the human named Beren who retrieves one of the Silmarillion. and dies yet there love is eternal . THe book also tells of the tale of Turambar and the madness he is afflicted with because of Melkor. The kingdom of Doriath falls over greed and desire for possession of the Silmarillion.Turgon also sets up a kingdom that is hidden from Melkor but soon that falls as we'll. Such was fortold by Ulmo, lord of the sea. After there realm is destroyed the survivors flee and link up with the survivor of Doriath. From them produced the heir called Elrond.The book tells also the tale of Numenor and how Suaron swayed them against the Valar. Such betrayal led to their destruction. ¬†I will not blow the ending by telling you what happened to Melkor and Sauron. Needless to say there is an encapsulating of the last war against Sauron which many of you are familiar with as the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. This story will give you good background into some of the things you see in the movies that is not explained in the book ""The Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" Such background would give depth and understanding, especially with the Hobit movies that have been stretched into a trilogy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OQX3BCYXIFFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007978PGI#wasThisHelpful","R3OQX3BCYXIFFB","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a classic, written in the 1980‚Äôs and has had several editions put out later. Due to the age of the book there may have been many developments in the Pagan arena , so some of the information might still seem dated. The authoress herself passed away on July 28, 2014.¬†Since Gerald Gardner birth the modern witchcraft revival, the Witch Craft Pagan community has grown by leaps and bounds. The most popular facet of the Pagan movement is the growth of Wicca, Gerald‚Äôs child. The face of the craft has changed a lot since it‚Äôs inception, especially here in America. ¬†Using interviews and research Margot Adler gave us an accurate picture of the Pagan movements growth. In the beginning Wicca centered around the God and Goddess and one had to be initiated into a coven in order to practice.¬†Once the craft moved over to the United States of America things began top change radically. The first change as marked by the Susan B. Anthony Coven founded by Z Budapest represented the feminine version of the craft which is wholly Goddess centered. This is called Dianic Wicca. In terms of participation Wicca and Paganism have become les coven centered and more festival and group oriented. There was also a movement away from tradition towards being eclectic but now that is reversing.¬†The book not only covers the current trends in Wicca but also covers the history of witches and how people perceive them. The most noted controversy regards the birth of the craft. Some people say that Gerald made it all up and that there were no witches stretching back to the beginning of time. Some like Margerite Murray feel that it was around. In ancient sources there are mentions of Witches working Hekate and ISIS. Practitioners like Isaac Bonewits feel that there may have been pocket of groups that worshipped the Goddess, but not certainly all of them. The medieval witches may have been a figment of the inquisitors imagination. In any case there are three types of witches. The first type of witch is the Family Traditional Witch. Many of these are non coven based and very individualistic. Their practice is not entirely pure as it has been contaminated with modern ideas. The second type is the gothic witch who model themselves after the Inquisition witch. The third is the modern Wiccan.¬†In terms of Wiccans there are many branches or schools.¬† The first is obviously the Gardnerians and then the Alexandrians. But there have cropped up other types like the Algards which combine the first two. There are also Georgians and they have their own way of doing rituals. Other orders that are new creations have popped up in San Francisco like the New Order of the Reformed Golden Dawn. One of it‚Äôs founder Aidan Kelley has since moved back to Catholocism. He¬† believes the Goddess most pof the Pagans are worshipping is actually the Virgin Mary. She has the compassion.¬†In addition to covering witchcraft there is also coverage of Druidic and Egyptian orders in the Pagan Sphere. Some have found their own path to the Gods like the Church of Aphrodite and Ferfaria. The Church of All Worlds was creted with inspiration from Stranger in a Strange Land.¬†By and large Pagan if they wish to call themselves tend to be rather well educated city dwellers who have a strong ecological bent. Many will want to use the term witch due to negative connotations while other‚Äôs wish to reclaim the word. Some believe in secrecy to avaoid trouble while others are out in the open about things.¬†A great book for those just getting started into paganism","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GDWV8ZV8MAHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014019536X#wasThisHelpful","R3GDWV8ZV8MAHT","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The RebellionNo the title is not about Lucifer rebelling against God or storming the gates of Heaven to take over. In fact the book is not even about the devil. The idea behind the book is liberation of the self to pursue you own true will and peruse the great work if you even want to call it that. Written in dedication to magicians and therapist Christopher Hyatt who espoused ¬†a radical philosophy that was considered to dangerous by the establish, the work comprises works by many different authors and contributors. Among the contributor are Osho, Israel Regardie, William Hyatt,Austin Osman Spare, Peter Conte, Lon Milo Duquetten and several others. The topics they cover are Marquise De Sade, Prayer, the use of language, martial arts and a few others.Like I said the book is about liberation and breaking free from the crowd and choosing your own path. Our society and our parent have programmed us from the get go on what we are supposed to do , what to like and who to love. Often times this programming tells us to go against our own interest and not pursue our true will. Included in these messages are thought or recording that make us feel inferior or down, they eat away at our self confidence. This book is about breaking those chains that society has placed on us. This is dangerous to the powers that be, the church, the state and the multimillionaires who exploit the working class. This is the left hand path, recognizing your own god hood and letting everyone else realize theirs.Starting off with an essay about Marquis De Sade, most known for his delight in torturing women. He ended up being imprisoned and died in an insane asylum. He was not imprisoned for what he did to the women he was imprisoned for defaming Christianity.Marquise saw it all. People in power engage in behavior that is not only immoral and hypocritical but also down right cruel to the people underneath them. They go off on hurting people. But De Sade wrote about self liberation and about an elite core of supermen who ran things and were more enlightened. They ran things. Most of his writing were suppressed as they brought up things that threatened the power structure.Who are these enlightened being. In other essays they are people who have realized their own godhood and are pursuing their true will. They are not like sheep ¬†that follow the heard where ever they go rather they strike their own path. THey do not get their rocks off by exploiting others. As for slaves they do not serve these enlightened ones rather they go about their psychic slumber and do what everyone else does. They are slaves.The world is in deep trouble and their are some addresses of the political. But before that one must do the work inside and change the software in order to improve the hardware which is their brain. Robert Anton Wilson is a big proponent of changing how we use language.Change the language then change the perception of what you see and hear. Most people will that the computer is white...no room for interpret at . What we should say if that the computer appears to be white. This leave room for different interpretation and flexibility for new information.Osho, a philosopher from India, state that revolution have occurred constantly. The powerless take the power from those who hold it but nothing really changes. What he calls for is a rebellion that stems from the word yes rather then no and that rebellion takes place with. Start with love and opening the mind to better possibilities and watch it spread from person to person.Some of the essays talk about politics.One particular essay is on the issue of gun control and how it pertains to the constitution. We have the right to own weapons for self defense. Yet the author is against registering them for fear a nzi like government will take them away. Another essay talks about Obama and his Obama care. I get the concept and the line of though but in terms of politics I believe to each their own and would not have placed such in a book like this.On Christianity which has been hypocritical and bloody has reduced the populace to the thinking of sheep. Thanks to Christianity people believe in a cocent of armageddon. Such mistaken thinking is based on faulty translation and misunderstanding. We now now believe in it that we will probably create our own Armegedden.¬†Over all excellent works by the authors. While my review gives a good over view and some depth I strongly advise you get the book and read it. It is only 4.99 on Amazon kindle. I took aery from this book a desire to plumb deeper into quantum psychology and that our language forms our thought which influences strongly our perception of reality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHVFCCJSZW9OJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2X3272#wasThisHelpful","RHVFCCJSZW9OJ","A32IVZXAIUS36L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32IVZXAIUS36L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has everything you need to know about bookkeeping, but in a very easy to read format.  It has a very short chapter about using a few different software programs for doing your bookkeeping, but is in no way a manual on how to use them.  This book is goes over everything from day to day tasks to doing end of month and end of year reports, and finally filing taxes and prepping for a new accounting cycle.

"I've had mats like this that have worked perfectly before, but not this one.  I'm using it in my shower and the non-slip works great until the water from my shower starts to build up.  For some reason, the water will not drain out quickly enough and I end up standing in about an inch or so of water mixed with soap, shampoo and conditioner which becomes very slippery.  I've checked the drain and everything is working properly when the mat is not on, so it's the mat itself that is causing problems.

"This is the perfect pitcher for clean water in my opinion.  First of all, it's very easy to set up.  It takes a little time for the water to filter, but I feel good about that.  The size of the pitcher is great - it fits just fine on one of the regular shelves of our refrigerator.  It's very narrow, so it hardly takes up any space.  There is an indicator on the lid that will let you know when the filter needs to be changed, which is really nice.  There is a little bit of spillage when pouring water out of the pitcher, but that's really a very small complaint.  This is just what I've been looking for.Update:  Actually, the spillage when pouring water out of the pitcher is a bigger nuisance that I thought it would be.  We've gotten to a point where we only pour water out over the sink because water goes everywhere if we don't.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29MD6GJ8AM8ZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FQ8TCQ#wasThisHelpful","R29MD6GJ8AM8ZV","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This calendar is so much nicer than I expected it to be.  First of all, the cover is a very pretty sage green and it has almost a suede-like feel to it, even though it's not.  The inside of the calendar looks very old fashioned, with beige pages and lots of curlicues around the dates and other areas of the pages.  There are really pretty old fashioned lettering and illustrations around the calendar pages, all lightly done to look old.  Each page has a nice inspirational quote at the top.As for the calendar, it's perfect.  There are tabs for each month, and each month starts out with the whole calendar for that month.  Then the rest of the month is each week with 5 very nice sized lines on each day for writing down appointments, etc.  Each month's pages are a different color, but they all blend into the same theme.

"This band is perfect for my iPhone 6, even with my Case-Mate clear case on it.  I did not want to have to take my case off and on to be able to use this and while it's a really tight fit, I'm able to get the phone with case in and out with only a few minutes of wiggling it back and forth.  The band comes with an extension, which I would imagine would be good for men, but for me as an average sized woman it fits just fine without it.  The little slot for a key is a nice touch too.I would highly recommend this case.  Once it's on you can use your phone just like it's not even in a case.  The only issue is with the phone itself - since the iPhone 6 is larger than the older iPhones, you will notice it more than the smaller phone.  But, that has nothing to do with the band.  The only reason I put that comment in this review is that if you think having the large phone on your arm would annoy you, you might want to look for another type of holder for your phone while working out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XEOR2MW9C5E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEIKZ90#wasThisHelpful","R1XEOR2MW9C5E8","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these pens to use with Johanna Basford's coloring books.  I read on her blog that these pens were some of her favorites, so I thought I couldn't go wrong.  The pens themselves are great.  There is every color I'd need in this package, and I'm able to blend with them.  The tips are super fine, which makes them perfect for all the tiny places to color in her books.  I can color the tiniest dot with no problem at all.  The only issue I have with using the pens with the books is that some of the colors bleed on to the design on the back of the page you're working on.  That's a little disappointing, but I think I'll be able to color over the spots just fine.  The problem only seems to be with the paper used in her books, though.  I'm testing out each color on cardstock before I use it and there is no bleeding at all on the back of the sheet.  So, if you can live with a little bit of color on the pages you haven't started coloring yet, I'm sure you'll be very happy with these pens.I almost forgot to mention that the barrels of the pens are triangular shaped and that really makes it very comfortable for coloring for long periods of time.  Very nice touch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2782T0LEU9YJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYX80IY#wasThisHelpful","R2782T0LEU9YJE","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice hand lotion.  The scent is just perfect - it's light, but very pretty.  It lingers slightly after you put it on, but not enough to be annoying.  He lotion goes on really smoothly and absorbs pretty quickly.  Not as quickly as some hand lotions I've used, but after a few minutes I can use my hands as usual.  I really think this lotion might be best used at night.  There is a bit of a residue even after washing my hands, but I don't feel like my hands are suffocating.  I just think this might work best if used before bed.

"We used this to test my husband's ethnicity because his mother thought they might have a little French in their family but wasn't sure.  I saw a commercial that showed a man getting rid of his lederhosen because he found he wasn't German after all, and thought for sure this test would tell us what we wanted to know. But, all it told us is that he was 41% Western European, which could be several countries.  So, if you are looking to see if you are from a particular country you will not get that information - just what region you are from.  I guess if you want to know more you have to go through the list of people they give you who have the same DNA, but that's way too time consuming.  This would probably be nice for someone who is really into genealogy and wants to spend time researching your family, but if you are thinking you'll get a list saying you're a certain percentage French, another percentage German and so on, this is not what you'll get.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FJW8IQLVU76J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRLVKW0#wasThisHelpful","R1FJW8IQLVU76J","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I've never had earbuds that have fit as well as these do.  They come with 3 different sized EarWings and EarGels, and once you find the ones that are just right for your ears, they are a perfect fit and don't feel like they are coming out at all.  I only plan on using these for walking, so I don't know how they'd work for a more rigorous workout, but I have a feeling they'd stay in just fine.  There is a volume switch for your music on the cord, yet the cord is pretty short and when you have it on you hardly notice it.As for the coaching part of these earbuds, it took me a little while to figure it all out, but once I did I found that it's exactly what I was hoping for.  There are two apps, a Sound app and a Sport Life app.  I didn't find the Sound app helpful at all and will probably not use it.  With the Sport Life app, all you have to do is select the Current Active choice for your music and you can listen to anything on your phone.  I mostly like to listen to books while I walk and it works perfectly with my Audible app.  I also tested it with the Apple Podcast app, Apple Music and Amazon Music and was able to listen to all of them.  While you are walking, you will get a voice message every 10 minutes (or however often you'd like) telling you how far and how long you've walked.  You can also set the app to tell you more information, such as your stride, etc. but I just want to know how far I've walked and for how long.  It's very easy to set the app to do just what you want.If you are not into just walking, there are many other activities to choose from.  You can also set the app to play several complete workouts for you.  You will hear the ear buds telling you to do 20 pushups, then rest for 10 seconds, 10 squats, rest for 10 seconds, etc.  Music will be playing in the backround while you do the exercises.The earbuds come with a very small hardshell case that will easily fit into your purse or pocket.  I have my earbuds and the charging cord in it and they fit just fine.All in all, I think these are just great for making your workouts more enjoyable and for giving you motivation by keeping you informed on how you're doing.  At the end of the day you can look at the history of how often you worked out and that will be very inspiring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OQ7Y9GDHHNER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X144EMM#wasThisHelpful","R2OQ7Y9GDHHNER","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm trying them out on adult coloring books, and while the color isn't the best for that purpose - and they are not advertised for coloring - I'm really enjoying using them.  You get a much more even color if you apply a light touch and so your colors will be more on the pastel side.

I have to have a very dark room for sleeping.  The brighter setting would probably work very nicely if you are looking for something to give you a little bit of light in the bedroom.I also really love being able to use the USB charging for my devices.  You just plus the cord you already use for charging into the port on the back of the radio and charge your device as usual.

"In my opinion, there couldn't be an easier way to clean the toilet.  You just attach one of the scrubbers to the wand that you get with your original kit, scrub the toilet and then push the button on the wand to drop the scrubber in the trash.  You never have to touch anything yucky at all.  As for the scrubbing - it's great.  The scrubbers have lots of cleaning solution on them and the scrubbing part is roughly textured enough to be able to really clean.The only thing I would say to be careful about it that the cleaning solution is blue and it will stay on your toilet rim if you do not rinse it of.  I just use a disposable cleaning cloth to go around all the areas where I can see blue.  If you happen to miss a spot it will be harder to get off later, but it doesn't leave a permanent stain.  Other than that little issue, I don't think you can go wrong with these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7LUI7PUWE2Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2T6SQ4#wasThisHelpful","R7LUI7PUWE2Y5","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This candle is just beautiful.  The paper around the jar holding the candle is slightly textured and is printed with the most gorgeous floral print.  The back of the candle tells a little bit about the New York Botanical Garden and has a link so you can learn more about it.  The lid is printed on the inside with a complete description of the scent of the candle, including the top notes, middle notes, base notes and essential oils.  I have the Peony Bouquet scent and it is just the nicest scent.  It's definitely a floral scent, but in no way annoying or fake smelling at all.  It truly smells like being in a garden.  When the lid is off the candle you can smell the scent throughout the whole room.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this as a gift for someone or just for your own home.  It's one of the nicest candles I've had.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UJYMR7IHADPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEDG38I#wasThisHelpful","R2UJYMR7IHADPN","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I couldn't be happier with this tracker.  I've never used one before but even though I am new to this, I've had no trouble at all understanding it or getting it to work.  When I opened the box I was a little worried when I didn't see any instructions and just a website to go to, but the website information was excellent.  There were enough step by step written instructions and videos for me to be able to set it up and pair it with my iPhone 6 with no problems at all.  Having the band paired with my iPhone has not shown any decrease in my phone battery usage, which was a big relief.Wearing the band is great.  Most of the time I don't even remember I have it on.  I have had no problems at all with the clasp and even though it's a little bit of a different type of clasp that I've ever used, the instructions and videos showed me exactly how to clasp it and it's super easy now.  I leave it on all day except when I'm in the shower.  The instructions say it's OK to wear in the shower, but I take it off anyway.  The only issue I've had with the band is that sometimes it will change itself from active mode to sleep mode and I can't figure out why.  But, when the band changes modes, the vibration and flash of the icons are so obvious that I can put it right back into the mode I want.  It would be nice if this didn't happen at all, and hopefully it's something that will be fixed in a software update.The best part of the band to me, is the app.  Wearing the band is completely effortless and there is nothing to look at on the band except when modes change, so you track your progress on your phone.  The app itself keeps track of your steps, resting heart rate and monitors your sleep.  I have found the sleep monitoring very accurate and extremely helpful.  You can also add other apps that you already use and they will work together.  I've used My Fitness Pal for years and it was super easy to sync the two apps and now my exercise data goes right from my UP software to My Fitness Pal, and my nutrition data goes right from My Fitness Pal to my UP software.  You can also add your food through the UP app, but since I already use My Fitness Pal I just synced the two.  When you set up the tracker you enter your weight and goals and can easily update those in the UP app.  The UP app shows you your daily progress on sleep, steps and food, and then you can click on each category to get more detailed information.  There is a Coach that keeps track of what you've done in previous days and will challenge you to try to do more steps the next day, which is really nice.  There is also a section where you can keep track of how you are feeling during the day.  It gives you some generic feelings, such as ""good"", ""exhausted"", etc. but you can edit those and put in your own feelings along with comments.  You can also set reminders in the app and your band will vibrate to remind you.  I have a reminder set to tell me to get up and walk every half hour since I work at a desk all day.I really could go on and on because I love it so much, but I'll just end this review by saying that I highly recommend this band.  Especially if you are like me and are not really athletic, but just want to keep track of the basics of your health lifestyle and have an easy and carefree way of trying to do better each day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SSNLWGVFE5X0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9E6DUK#wasThisHelpful","R2SSNLWGVFE5X0","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The chili is not overly hot, but it definitely stands out in every bite.  I've had chocolate with chili in it before, but with the nuts and the sweetness of the mixture that holds the bars together, it was an absolutely delicious combination.  And, one bar was enough.

"I had used Hope in a Jar for years but decided to look around for something less expensive and tried this.  I could not be happier with it.  The cream is pretty thick yet goes on easily and really, just a small amount on my fingertip is plenty for my whole face.  I was a little worried at first because the cream has kind of a tropical scent, but the scent goes away right away and you smell nothing at all during the day.  The cream goes right into my skin and leaves no residue at all.  I just feel nice and soft and my skin feels like nothing at all is on it.

"I'm using this with my 6"" Kindle Fire and it couldn't be more perfect.  At first I was a little confused about which disk to attach to my Kindle since it comes with 3 - 1 large ""sticky pad"" and 2 very thin stick on disks. The directions were a little unclear to me, so I just went ahead and attached the sticky pad since it is reusable.  It worked great but since I put it directly on my Fire, I was not able to put it back in the case I have.  So, I removed it and used one of the thin disks and was much happier.  The small disks are so thin that I can still put it in my case when I want to, but it works just great with the Tab-Legs.  So, you actually can use this with 3 devices - one with the big sticky pad and two with the thin disks.The magnet is in the top of the Tab-Legs and the disks are metal, so that's how it works.  Another bonus of having the magnet in the top of the Tab-Legs is that I can store it by just sticking it onto a metal surface.  I just happen to have lamps with a metal bases next to my side of the bed and my spot on the couch, so I can just stick it there when I'm not using it and I hardly notice it when the legs are straightened out.The Tab-Legs themselves are just a dream come true.  I'm able to position them so that I can read hands free and do needlework at the same time because the legs are the perfect height to make them just about eye level when I'm sitting on the couch.  I've also tried wrapping the legs around my neck and was so happy to find that the legs are long enough that I can see my Fire perfectly while walking around.  I need to have things a little farther away from me than I used to in order to see anymore, and the length of the Tab-Legs is just right.  It's also great while laying in bed watching videos because I can bend the legs into any position, making it perfectly comfortable to lay in any position - even on my side.  I'm very glad that I bought this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWWQMKW4FW4NQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FT5D22O#wasThisHelpful","RWWQMKW4FW4NQ","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm usually such a fan of Dummies books, but this one fell short for me.  To me, Social Security is such a complicated thing and this book really didn't tell me anything I didn't already know just from watching financial segments on the news, information I've read online, etc.  Truly, the most helpful thing in this book is the list of resources in the back.  I'm sure when the time comes, my husband and I will need to get some help and this list will give us some places to contact.  I suppose it might be worth purchasing the book for that, but unless you really don't know anything at all about Social Security, you might want to pass on this book.

"This book was very informative, but in an easy to read way.  I hate diet/health books that go into way too much scientific information before you even get into the parts about what to eat and do.  The layout of the book is kind of magazine style, with lots of blocks of information and lists, which I always like because it's easy to find what you are looking for.  There are quite a few recipes that sound good and look very easy to make.  There are lots of exercises and really good photos of how to do them.  The book not only gives you information on dieting, but lots of information on sleep, depression and anxiety and the dangers of taking pills to help you.  It seems to be focusing more on helping people feel better rather than just look better.Honestly, the information was really nothing I haven't seen online or in magazines, but it is so nicely assembled in this book that I think it would be worth purchasing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15CN5CKNO1GDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373893167#wasThisHelpful","R15CN5CKNO1GDO","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The author has a really good sense of humor and actually made their lifestyles sound kind of funny, which was fun.  I have to say I was a little disappointed because I thought I'd find out some things about the 1% that I had never heard of outside of reality shows and entertainment magazines and I really didn't read about anything I hadn't heard of before.  The book even has a conversation between a couple of wealthy people saying how it used to be so much more fun being rich when it was real (or something like that). They were saying how now anyone can give the appearance of having money when it just might mean they are in quite a bit of debt.  Another thing I was hoping for was some name dropping, but the author only describes people, such as ""Wife of Famous Rock Star"", etc.  So, we really have no idea who the people in the book are, unfortunately.

They are easier to take with something like Slim Fast, but I'm not about to add extra calories to my diet two more times a day just to take these pills.The second problem is that the magnesium in this supplement is not supposed to be taken with two of the prescriptions I take.  I've had to readjust my whole schedule to take them at different times of the day.  You may want to look at any prescriptions you take and see if there are any interactions with Magnesium Oxide before you decide on this brand.All that said, I have found that I'm getting all of the benefits from the magnesium drink that I was taking before these.

"I'm really impressed with this loom.  It came completely assembled except for the legs and they only took a minute to attach.  All the hardware you need is included.  The wood the loom is made of is really beautiful - nice and smooth and is engraved with the Melissa & Doug logo.There are several formations you can easily adjust this loom into.  You can leave it as is for large projects, the top bar moves down to the middle of the loom for a weaving half the size, and then there are two wooden dowels on the sides that can be moved to make the loom narrower.  It is really versatile.The weaving itself could not be simpler.  The only minor complaint I have is that the instruction book is in black and white and I had just a little bit of trouble figuring out where to get started and how to attach the yarn, but really it's very simple and not much instruction was needed after all.  You just tie the yarn onto the dowel and start weaving.The box contains two large balls of really pretty brightly colored bulky weight yarn, a ball of string and three sets of paper strips you can use for paper weavings. A really nice wooden needle for the weaving is also included.  There is close to a half inch space between each section on the top and bottom of the loom, so you would probably always want to use a thicker yarn.  I'm also thinking about trying to weave with fabric strips and see what kind of projects I can do with fabric.  I'm kind of excited to go online and look at what kinds of projects I can do with this loom.All in all, this is a really nice loom for adults or children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K0GMMQUM3SMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KO6UGXG#wasThisHelpful","R1K0GMMQUM3SMK","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The consistency of the eye drops seems a little thicker than regular drops.  He will definitely keep using this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DCJAC1NZTR7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KYTX6W#wasThisHelpful","R1DCJAC1NZTR7G","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The questions were good and some of them were things I've really wondered about, like what if everyone on earth jumped at the same time.  The answers to the questions start out funny,  but the next thing you know you are reading complicated formulas, distances and things like that.

"This book is so nicely done.  It's just a small book and would be a perfect little gift for someone who is interested in nature and the spiritual life.  The book is written by a nun but I did not find it overly religious, so it would probably be good for just about anyone.  The book is adorably illustrated throughout.  The book is made up mostly of text, but there are quite a few pages that have illustrations along with quotes that compare growing grapes to growing our spiritual lives.

The ball is a nice solid plastic and it does a much better job of mixing than the wire type.  The rounded bottom is the best part because if you make a drink out of powder, none of it gets stuck in the edges like it used to.

"My husband had to have surgery on his eye that required him to stay in a face-down position for a week after the surgery.  We rented the special chair, etc. that is used for recovery after this surgery, but I had also read somewhere that a massage table would be helpful too.  It was extremely helpful.  His back and neck would get tired from being in the chair, but then he could stretch out on this table and be completely comfortable again.  We'd just put his iPad on a low table below him and he could keep his face down and watch TV for hours.The table is very sturdy and super easy to assemble. You can remove the face pillow if you'd rather use something else to rest your head on, which is what my husband did.  He pretty much just rested his chin on the edge of the bed and he was in the perfect position.  My husband is 6'1' and weighs 250 pounds and the table never wobbled or felt like to was going to fall over.  The legs adjust easily and we adjusted it to the lowest position to make it easy for him to get on and off.  I highly recommend having this table on hand if you or someone in your house has to have this type of surgery.  My husband's surgery was a complete success and I understand that keeping your face down is almost as important as the surgery.  This made it very easy for him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AL2FFDMBNL9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003D6F5HQ#wasThisHelpful","R3AL2FFDMBNL9U","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Her sister-in-law gives her some money and tells her to keep herself busy furnishing her house.  Nella finds an ad for a miniaturist and requests a few things.

"This book is almost like a directory of websites for different resources we'll all need as we age.  As with all Dummies books, it briefly explains things like Medicare, Assisted Living, Long Term Care Insurance, etc., but it gives you lists of websites to go to for more information.  I like this because I want to know which sites are reputable and not something that will give me bad information.  For this alone, I find this book very helpful.  The book is only 341 pages and it covers just about every area of aging from staying in your own home to tables of the cost of assisted living facilities, transportation alternatives (which I really found helpful) and basic health information for aging people.  There is a small section on finances and estate planning, but not that much - it's mostly on how to live as an elder, not a financial guide.  The amount of information covered in the book is everything I've thought of, plus several things I didn't even know about.  I would highly recommend this book to have on hand to give you a start on where to look when you need help.  It's easy enough for an elder to read or for someone who is caring for an elder - just make sure if you are an elder yourself, you are comfortable with the computer because you will be looking at a lot of websites.  But, with AARP behind the book, I feel confident that they are sending us to the right places online to look and that's very important.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WDUX99H008BT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118725751#wasThisHelpful","R2WDUX99H008BT","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are two in the package and as of right now they are both in the trash can.  No matter how hard I tried to remove all the dust from my screen before applying them, I'd find specks of dust that could not be smoothed out.  I was able to get rid of all the air bubbles, but not the dust. It did cut out all of the glare, but rather than looking at my reflection in the screen, I was zeroed in on the specks of dust under the protector.

"This case is really nice, especially the material that it's made of.  It feels kind of like felt, and if you are looking for something besides leather for a change, this is a nice option.  I have the grey and absolutely love the look of it.The case is very simple.  You snap the Kindle into a hard plastic back and then just stand it to whatever angle is comfortable for you.  I guess because of the slightly rough surface (it's very soft to hold, but it's not slippery like leather or plastic), it will stay where you stand it on it's own.  I think it's meant to lean against the edge, like you see in the photo, but you can also stand it anywhere and it will stay.If you want to hold the Kindle in you hand, you can flip the flat part back and there is a magnet to hold the front and back together.  To close it, you fasten the tab that you see in the photo that the Kindle is leaning on.  It straightens out to a tab that you secure the case with.If you are looking for a very thin, lightweight case, you can't go wrong with this.

"My favorite thing about this cover is the look.  It's made of fabric and looks and feels like soft, faded denim.  I think it would be perfect for a man or a woman.The case fits the Fire perfectly and leaves all of the buttons completely exposed to you can get to them. The speakers are exposed too and the sound is as good as without a case.  It works well horizontally for watching videos and vertically for reading.  The plastic part of the case that you put the Fire in has two little tabs on it that fit in grooves on the bottom of the case to hold it still.  It is very secure.  I find that the slant at even the level closest to the back of the case is too much of an angle for when I'm laying in bed watching videos, so I set put the back of the case that has the grooves on it out flat facing the back (like a train on a dress) and that holds the Fire up perfectly straight and it doesn't fall over at all.  If you are sitting and looking down on the Fire, all of the angles that the Fire can go to are just right - from almost upright, like you see in the photo to leaning back quite a bit for typing.As for reading in a vertical position, the case works very well too.  There is an elastic band on the bottom part (with the grooves) and if you wrap it around the part of the case with the Fire in it, it will stay perfectly flat.  I leave my thumb on the outside to turn pages, put my index finger in between the front and back of the cover and hold the rest of my fingers on the back of the case and am able to read perfectly comfortably with one hand.This is a very attractive case and is very comfortable to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L6Q8UZSYVLSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQZQQN6#wasThisHelpful","R3L6Q8UZSYVLSJ","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book gives you tips on relaxing and reducing stress by giving you examples of things done in different parts of the world.  Each situation is on two pages. One page is a photo or illustration and the next page is the title of the stressful situation.  After that, the page goes on to tell you the tradition that is practiced, what time of year and the country it was originated in.  The text is only a few paragraphs, but it is so well written that you get a lot out of it in a short time. My favorite part of the book is that the practices were things I really hadn't thought about before.  In fact, in the introduction they tell you the don't go into the obvious such as yoga or tai chi.  Not that there is anything wrong with those, but there is a lot of information on these topics already.  This book covers things such a ""Laugh in the Face of Danger"" which tells about Greek philosophers who imagine worst case scenarios and then write down how they would handle them.  Or ""Aim for Excellence"" which talks about how some Japanese Sushi chefs master just one dish.  This is to show us an example of trying to focus on one thing rather than stressing ourselves out by trying to do everything.  We learn about patience from stilt fishers in Sri Lanka and staying in the present from the Piraha Language in Brazil that has no words to describe the past or the future.  The book is 125 pages, so there are many more practices you might find helpful or just enjoy reading about them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M4MOTEUIZ45B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743218451#wasThisHelpful","R1M4MOTEUIZ45B","A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The wood is slick enough for your knitting to move right along, yet they are not so slippery that you have to constantly worry about your stitches falling off.  The cords are an absolute dream to work with and are not stiff at all. The point is just right - pretty pointy, but not so pointy that it splits the yarn you are working with. The best part is that you don't notice the difference between the cord and the needle at all - the join is perfectly smooth.  The fun part of the needles is that the sizes are all different colors.

"I've had bad luck with putting on screen protectors in the past, so when I tried to apply this one I really tried to do everything right.  I followed the instruction to the letter and made sure I had a nice quiet place to work.  I thought I had my screen perfectly clean, but still when I applied the protector I found  one little bit of dust. I was able to remove the protector easily, but it just went downhill from there. Once I removed the protector, dust started collecting on the adhesive backing and I could not get it all off. Every time I put it back on my Kindle, I noticed more dust. The protector is very forgiving, in that it's a thickish piece of plastic, but after removing it several times to try to remove dust, I bent the corner slightly and I would not be able to live with that.  So, I've had another failed attempt at applying a screen protector.  If the one bit of dust wouldn't bother you like it did me, you may be happy with this.  Before I noticed the speck of dust, I checked it out and my Kindle worked just like it did before it had the protector on it.

"Sheesh, Amazon has a picture of a t-shirt instead of the hoodie. It's a hoodie, ignore their picture.Just what I needed. I tried a few other brands here on Amazon, but couldn't find a full-zip hoodie that was movable and functional for me to wear to work in. I decided to try this Champion in a 4X and love it. A 4X is typically too big on me, but at 6'3"" 275, too big on me doesn't happen that often. This hoodie has nice full cut shoulders and arms. It probably is a little big on me, but that's perfect for moving around.A few important parts:If you get cold easy this hoodie might not be thick enough for you. It's a thin, but high quality polyester material. I rarely get cold, so it works well for me.The most flexible (physically) hoodie I own.Short/small waistband keeps it from feeling like you need to pull it down.Full pockets on the front. Also are fairly snug so you can hold most things in them without worrying about them falling out.Good quality zipper, most of the others I've tried had plastic zippers. This one is metal.Would even recommend the non-tall versions for tall-big guys. I ordered the regular 4X and the sleeves come down to my wrists, the length of the jacket goes below my waist.I would like to thank whomever the person was, no doubt a big man, who invented ""generous cut"". I can finally stop trying to wear flannel shirts when I'm working outdoors in the cold weather. And most importantly, I don't have to spend the next month fighting holiday crowds, trying on hoodies/jackets trying to find one that doesn't make me feel like a mummy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UG5N7L7UPYO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RL8D9HU#wasThisHelpful","R2UG5N7L7UPYO6","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very underrated album. I found these guys years ago. Which is how I will describe them. I've been a huge Glenn Danzig fan for years. Also Wino of The Obsessed, St. Vitus, Spirit Caravan, etc...The first time I heard these guys they reminded me of early Danzig (the band not Glenn) mixed with ""The Church Within"" era The Obsessed. Those are two of my favorite bands so I gave Goatsnake a try and loved it. This new album sticks to the formula. It's good, heavy bluesy rock, crooning and screaming vocals. I'm sure some people will classify it as stoner rock or whatever sub-genre, but it's really just good bluesy hard rock. I've had this album for nearly 5 months and still have it in my regular rotation. I would recommend it to any fan of hard rock, especially if you like nice, cleanly-sung vocals. I especially like the song House of the Moon, has some female vocal accompaniment that is reminiscent of an old church choir.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJBYJGC4SWLW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VNW8ZU6#wasThisHelpful","RJBYJGC4SWLW0","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hopefully this will be helpful for parents and friends/family who are trying to pick a console to buy someone. If you'll look in my review history, I have a verified purchase review of a higher end gaming PC I bought back in spring (2015). I was swearing off console games after 30+ years of console gaming. Then ... I started missing my consoles. We were already planning on buying two consoles this Christmas. One for our 13 year old daughter and one for our 11 year old son. Their choices were easy ... mine, not so much.Our 11 year old son made his choice loud and clear, ""Why can't I play online games with my friends anymore?"" He was playing on an Xbox 360. They were playing on Xbox One. That, not the exclusives, not the negligible difference in graphics, should be a deciding factor if your child or big child likes playing online games. I would guess it's something us gamers take for granted in knowing, but for those who are shopping for a console for someone else you need to know this:If you buy a PS4 for someone and their friends play games online on the Xbox One, they will not be able to play together and vice versa. Our son loves the online multiplayer games and that was the only factor for him. It's the one his friends have and play online.Our 13 year old daughter is a very casual gamer. My wife is as well. They love Nintendo though. Mario and Zelda are their favorites. So buying a Wii U for our daughter makes perfect sense. See how easy this is?Buying one for me? I'm an ol' grouchy anti-social gamer. I don't like online games. I prefer immersive one player games. The difference between the PS4 and Xbox One for me is almost non-existent. Either one would work fine. I don't care for exclusive games. There's only a couple out right now that I have any interest in. Bloodborne on PS4 and State of Decay on Xbox One. My first step to deciding was to buy an Xbox One last month at Target. I liked it, but returned it for a PS4. I liked it, but returned it for a refund. I knew better holiday bundles were coming out. The difference between the two systems is one of the smallest gaps I've seen in my 30+ years of console gaming. I would compare it to the difference between the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis back in the early 90s. Both systems seem to be equally as strong and capable as the other. These were my deciding factors:I prefer the look of the Xbox One.I preferred the PS4s user-interface before the November 12th Windows 10 update on the Xbox One, but I now prefer the Xbox One's user-interface and compatibility with my PC.I'm a different one. I prefer the exterior power block of the Xbox One.Controllers are becoming closer to equal. In all fairness to Sony, I think the PS4's controller is a bigger, better change than the Xbox One's, which I had already gotten used to since I use one for my PC games. The PS4 controller is still smaller than I would like, but the Xbox One's has gotten smaller too.I generally like the free games Xbox Live gives away each month better than the Playstation Network's.I originally leaned towards Sony because I bought into the numbers arguments. Sony sells more consoles. Sony has more games. Both of which are true, but Sony has a bigger market than Microsoft. Anyway, Justin Beiber sold more albums than my favorite band, but it doesn't make him better. After scanning through both consoles lists on wiki of games, I realized the Sony number is quite a big higher, but a lot of the games are Japanese games. I grew up with some of those classic JRPG's, but really don't have much interest in them anymore.But my big deciding factor was simple:The recent bundle specials. I originally bought a PS4 Last of Us bundle that I returned. I haven't been able to find any PS4 bundles that stand out to me. I did the promo through Amazon and received the 1TB Madden 16 bundle with another free game and a fifty dollar store credit. I used the free game to get Far Cry 4 Complete and used the store credit to pre-order Fallout 4. That means I got 3 of my favorite game series, a year subscription to EA Access, a 1TB console and controller for four hundred dollars. Also did the same promo for our son's at another store and got him the Forza 6 bundle, got Call of Duty Black Ops 3 and Assassin's Creed Syndicate for his free game and fifty dollar credit.Take that how you will. If Sony had been offering a similar deal then I would have been stuck again on deciding on which one, but good marketing by Microsoft made me decide to get the Xbox One. The other small factor is the large collection of Xbox 360 games I have. With the Windows 10 update backwards compatibility was added for over 100 games from the 360 and more are coming. Sony's ""backward compatibility"" plan sounds more like a money grab to me.Having said all of this, I think the only way you can truly go wrong on the PS4 or Xbox One is if you buy the one your friends, or your child's friends don't have. Unless you're an anti-social gamer like me. Then I would say just shop around until you find a bundle you like. Getting 3 games with a new console is pretty nice and whatever you do, ignore the numbers arguments. My dad used to always tell me, ""You can only play one game at a time"" and as hard as it to believe these days, that still holds true.Edit: I forgot to mention if you're buying a console for a casual gamer it wouldn't hurt to look at the Wii U by Nintendo. It seems like every game coming out for the Xbox One and PS4 has a season pass, DLC, and these games are starting to become expensive. The vanilla price has stayed the same for new games, but when you have to then buy a season pass for twenty to fifty dollars, these games can be expensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24LA2D0M9APBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011L4D30W#wasThisHelpful","R24LA2D0M9APBF","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have five people in our household. It seems like each one of them add something to their lives that take AA batteries, every week. I started out ordering the Duracell coppertops in bulk from Amazon, but they were temporarily sold out of them last year. I then turned to the Maxell bulk package from Amazon. I really didn't see a huge difference between the Duracell and Maxell. I've been waiting to run out of Maxell's so I could try the AmazonBasics AAs. I've put 8 to use so far, Xbox 360 controller x 2, MS wireless mouse x 2, flashlight x 4. The only one that I can compare to the others is the Xbox 360 controller. I usually get about 2 months on 2 AAs in it. I've had these AmazonBasics in it for 7 weeks and they're still going with the on-screen display saying I have 2 bars out of 4 left in the battery. As long as they keep a similar to the pace the other two I'll be happy with them. Works well in the flashlight too, no dimming, no fading of light. One thing I will mention is that I always preferred the Duracell packing method of 16 per tray. The Maxell packing was easy to accidentally spill the entire package. These AmazonBasics are even better than both of those. They come in a plain brown box. The batteries are then separated in blister packs of 4. So when your kids need 2 or 4, you can just hand them a blister pack without worrying about them losing the whole box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L87UQ5C9HVRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNV8E0C#wasThisHelpful","R2L87UQ5C9HVRL","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had the Amazon store card for roughly 3 years now. Admittedly, I only use it when I'm going to be spending enough to receive the 0% financing for 6 months or more, but it's easily one of my favorite cards to use. Why? It's easy to pay, at least easier than some cards I have and I like the flexibility of being able to pay it off over 6 months. I don't typically like to keep balances on my credit cards, but when I pay them all off it seems to negatively hurt my credit score. I can buy something over $300 with this card, set the auto-pay to pay it off in 5 months and know my credit score is receiving at least proof of one monthly, on-time payment. I have other cards from Synchrony Bank and haven't had a single problem with any of them. All of the ones I have also have the special financing rates for purchases over $300.Best thing about the Amazon one? It's partially linked to my Amazon account. I really preferred the old sign-in method, but I'm getting used to the new one. Amazon is generous with the credit line increases as well. Mine has increased by nearly 400% over the three years. Others might not agree, but I prefer it over the Amazon Visa. The Visa adds the flexibility of being able to use it anywhere that accepts Visa, but they gave me it with a fairly high credit line ($7200). but I really wanted the store card instead for the special financing, which the Visa doesn't offer. If you apply and they give you the Visa instead, give their customer service a call and they'll get you the store card. I know that everyone prefers the more prestigious cards, but trust me, this Amazon store card, when used in moderation and paid off during the promotion months is as good as any card I have. It's also an advantage if you have anyone in your family who ""borrows"" your wallet. The Amazon store card can only be used on Amazon and if you're like me you require all family members to wait before ordering on Amazon since you might need to add something to the order. I would also recommend Synchrony's Best Buy store card if you buy electronics there since it too has the special financing on purchases over $300. I'm overall impressed with Synchrony.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDR9IK5PSC8JM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008A0GNA8#wasThisHelpful","RDR9IK5PSC8JM","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this with one main use in mind ... to work in.I work as a construction engineer. My daily work varies from planning, drawing blueprints inside our house to surveying, grading land, all the way down to helping with the manual labor. We build, remodel houses and small businesses. That's important because I need my clothes to be movable and non-binding.I'm originally from California, but now live in the Southern Appalachian region. We have very inconsistent weather. I'm not the type of person who gets cold unless in bitterly cold windchill. That's why I wanted a midweight zip-up hoodie. It will serve pretty much as my late fall, winter jacket/coat while at work.The make of this hoodie is very good quality. I especially liked the mesh hood. There's a common problem for me with Under Armour products. It is really small. I know a few reviewers have said it runs big and I'm going to explain what the sizing problem is. If you have large shoulders you're going to think these run very small. I would go as far as saying it feels like a unisex. My shoulders have long been a problem when buying shirts, jackets, coats, but I read the reviews here and saw several say they run big. That's always a good sign for me.I'm on average 6'3"" 275. I ordered the 3XL.As soon as I put it on I noticed one big problem. The sleeves didn't even cover my forearms. Probably 2-3 inches from my wrist. This means my shoulders are too broad for the material. It causes the sleeves to have to make up for the lack of width in the shoulders. It's a common problem and I know I'm not the only one with this problem.I've always been confused by UA's sizing since their pants seem to be made for us large frame guys, but their shirts/tops are made for smaller to medium frame guys. No offense to anyone. I'm sure we all have our brands that just don't work with our builds.I really wish UA would make a big and tall line in their shirts. I'm able to wear their pants in XL, so I'm okay with the sizing on those, but I need their shirts to be a size bigger or cut more for a big frame. Good product. I can wear it fine. Even can zip it, but its skin-tight on my shoulders, upper arms and forearms. Would recommend it to anyone of the medium build or smaller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14XD0L0F3BMTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOANK3E#wasThisHelpful","R14XD0L0F3BMTL","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the Dr. Tung tongue scrapers for quite a few years. That is until my most recent one started rusting and the rubber handles started getting what looked like mold spots.I bought this HealthAndYoga tongue scraper mainly because it has no rubber grips on it. This is a review of a tongue scraper so don't expect too much from me on this:I originally had more trouble cleaning my tongue with this scraper than I normally did with the Dr. Tung version, but it's a matter of tilting it a little downwards. Once I figured this out it works as good as the Dr. Tung.It has a good build quality feel to it.No rubber handles to mold, mildew, rot.Only negative is the quality. The quality is so good and strong feeling it makes it hard to put this in a cup. The sides want to pop back out, but that's not really a negative, it's just something you should know. I used to put my tongue scraper in two holes of a toothbrush holder. If you do that, it may take some time to get this one used to being bent. Otherwise, it's a great scraper. Will update if any problems come up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I22IOF5VVJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LM43DWK#wasThisHelpful","R3I22IOF5VVJY","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This costume came the day before Halloween and all I can say about is it's not worth your money or time. Our 13 year old daughter wasn't going to dress up this year, but her school had a Halloween Day where all the students and teachers were invited to dress up. One of the boneheaded teachers offered 20 points bonus on their test that day for all who dressed up. Our daughter's first choice was Spider Gwen. I think that's her name. The only ones I found were from China, which wouldn't get here on time. So she decided this Spider Girl costume would work. She's athletic-build, even somewhat muscular for her age. Her mom ordered the large with the thinking that it would be loose on our daughter.She puts it on and it's skin-tight. I'm not worried too much about our daughter, but I used to be a 13 year old boy. My wife spent nearly two hours finding ways to cover up the ""bad"" parts of this costume. How is a large in women's sizing skin tight on a 5'2"" 120 pound 13 year old? My wife is 5'7"" 160, it wouldn't even go on her.Other problems: Like others have said there was a hole in the back of the costume. The costume we received was black not blue, which would have been fine if the red part was black and the spider was white, but instead it looks like a cheap knockoff of Spiderman. I wouldn't recommend it unless it's for an adult woman who unless of small frame, won't be able to fit into any of the sizes.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HJMDKD26J85Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008294FXY#wasThisHelpful","R3HJMDKD26J85Y","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's probably going to be hard to get me to give these costumes anything higher than 3 stars. The cape is decent quality. Lets put it this way. It's still in working condition after our 11 year old son wore it three times. The belt is decent quality, but was too long on him. He still wore it. Vest is decent quality and survived three wearings. And that's it. I would pay maybe ten dollars for this costume, but it instead costed over thirty.A few things to note:It doesn't come with anything else. The belt, cape and vest is all.No shirt to wear under it or pants or boots or makeup or fake blood.If my mood towards it sounds mediocre it's because the costume is mediocre as well.It's decent.

"I originally gave these loafers a 5 star review, but after wearing them some more, I'm not even going to be able to keep them. My biggest draw to these was to wear them as house shoes that I could wear outside when taking the dogs out, checking the mail, etc...They initially gave me a very good impression. The soles are plenty strong enough to wear outside and my guess is they are made for daily casual wear. The other draw and this would only apply when comparing them to other house shoes, is the lack of fur, fuzzy or hair inside the shoe. I will keep that explanation short. I have partial permanent nerve damage in my feet. Anything furry, fuzzy or hairy stimulates the damage. I really loved that these loafers didn't have any of those.I listed in my original review how these run small. It's now even more evident to me. Similar to another reviewer these loafers are snug on the front half of my foot and loose on the back/arch/heel part. It's not too big of a deal for me, but there's another problem that might just be a problem for me. I had never wore a pair of Crocs. The insoles have bumps and grooves in them. That's as irritating to my nerve damage as hair, fuzzy, furry insides of shoes. After wearing them for roughly 3 hours, sitting at my home office's desk, my feet started burning.Note: I am not in anyway saying it's the loafers fault. This is a problem I've had for nearly 15 years, but I did want to point out the insoles are bumpy and have grooves since I'm sure I'm not the only person with nerve damage in their feet. The thinking would be why not just change the insoles, but if I do that, the front half will be too tight. The front of the insoles that come in the loafers is a recessed groove. They are already snug in that area so other insoles would just make them tighter.Otherwise, these are still a four star product especially if you can catch them on sale like I did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R300A10PYNWH5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVOYWDK#wasThisHelpful","R300A10PYNWH5I","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the most disappointing purchases I've made on Amazon. For one, the customer reviews convinced me to try this alarm clock. No offense to Amazon members, I hope others use my reviews to make purchases as well and this one bad experience won't stop me from using Amazon reviews, but there's no way this clock should be priced what it is or have the high reviews it has. Preferences are a definite factor as is just plain old subjective opinion, but the problems I had with this clock wouldn't seem to fall under subjective opinion. For two, I love Seiko. I have reviews in my review history of two Seiko watches I've owned for nearly 10 years. Wouldn't wear another brand of watch. Which is really the biggest disappointment for me.To start with, do a search on Google for ""Equity Silver Silent Sweep clock"". Just a week before buying this Seiko, I had that Equity clock and returned it. It's nearly identical to this Seiko for one-third the price. Even worse, some of my complaints with this Seiko were fixed by that Equity.Starting with:The alarm hand is silver. It's a white-faced clock, why not a black, red, green, blue, purple hand?It's an all-plastic clock.The alarm annoys our dachshund, but doesn't even wake me up.The backlight is terribly weak for a clock that uses 3 AA batteries.The luminous hands aren't even working for me.Alarm clocks are essential for me. I sleep 5 hours a night during the week. Forcing myself up five days a week after 5 hours of sleep is sometimes hard. On the other hand, it can also mean problems for the poor alarm clock. Not that I intentionally punch the clocks, but I sometimes hit my hand on them as I'm trying to turn them off. I had been using this clock Sharp SPC800 Quartz Analog Twin Bell Alarm Clock (Silver)  for the last year. Then one day two weeks ago, it went off and it met an untimely demise. I'm really not trying to be funny or meaning puns, but it happens. I've been this way for many years. That Sharp is metal with a plastic face. One wrong swing and it now doesn't even try to work. So you can imagine what this plastic Seiko would do if my hand hits it. Everyone tells me to use my phone, but it's a six hundred dollar phone. I'm not risking destroying it.Those problems listed above are also based on my living environment. If you don't have these same problems it might be a good clock for you.Our bedroom has two ceiling fan/lights that are fairly dim. My wife goes to bed before I do so turning on lights isn't an option. Since I change my alarm daily depending on what time I go to bed, I had to, in the dark, try to see the alarm hand while turning the nearly flat alarm button on the front. It didn't hit me to push the snooze button which does give a better backlight, but even so, this clock isn't cheap and it says always on backlight.The alarm doesn't have a good analog sounding alarm. It sounds more like an underpowered digital clock gone haywire.All-plastic means it will last me about 6 months.I turned the backlight off and left the clock sitting in the window to power the luminous hands, but there's no luminous hands. I see the strips, but it's not working at all.The two things it does well and it's why I give it two stars is keeps time and doesn't tick. I actually like a ticking clock, but my wife can't stand ticking. I expected much more from this clock. Maybe some people don't think the price is high, but I bought a replacement Sharp for seven dollars that I'm now using. And again, had just returned that Equity clock which is 80% similar to this Seiko at 33% the price. I'll try that other Seiko with the twin-bells maybe it will be what I need and restore my faith in Seiko.Don't let my review push you away from this clock. You might like it. Just be sure to read the problems I had with it and if those would be problems for you consider a different clock. This is the one I'm going to try Seiko QXK118KLH Classic Bedside Alarm Clock","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24F6XCGRX87SD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AL0NUQ#wasThisHelpful","R24F6XCGRX87SD","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start by saying my only thing I use these trimmers for is trimming my beard. I did have some fun with them and our 11 year old son for reviewing purposes. Not to worry, he likes his hair buzzed short and hadn't had a haircut in nearly 2 months.I have these two pairs of trimmers:Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Hair Clipper & Beard Wet/Dry TrimmerWahl 9854-600 Lithium Ion All In One TrimmerThe Panasonic above are very good, but they don't have enough power for what I need.The Wahl's from above rusted on me. In Wahl's defense they offered a free replacement set (Review with comment from Wahl in my history).I had a specific problem. I don't like using guides when trimming my beard. I like to freehand trim my beard and to properly freehand you have to have pretty good power from your trimmer. Without good power all that happens is the hair pushes down before it's cut.My beard is roughly 4-5 inches in length when brushed out, but I like for it to look neat and even. Using the two above linked trimmers, I would get varying results. Most of the time with either I would go to bed with an even beard then wake up with a 99% even beard, with 1% of the beard sticking out, stray hairs and that defined the type of trimmer I needed. It needed to have the power to get those single stray hairs instead of pushing them down.My only knowledge of Philips products was with their televisions and older stereo systems. Everything I had bought from them had good quality, but it just didn't seem right to buy trimmers from what I knew as an electronics company. These Philips trimmers happened to have a coupon on them here on Amazon so I took a shot and have to say I'm impressed. The power is good enough to cut those stray hairs despite being quieter than the Wahl, similar sound as the Panasonic. Pushing the turbo button on these Philips trimmers boosts power even more, but I've only had to do it to test it out.Since I'm bald, I really didn't have any other way to test these out, so I talked our 11 year old son into letting me try them on his hair with the guides. Keeping in mind, I do not like using guides and have never had any success with guided shaves. That didn't change. I just think I don't know how to use guides. These guides are solid, stay in place, but our son's hair still had uneven spots.There are 3 guides included. One has a 2-12 range. One has a 2-16 range. One has a 2-20 range. I'm guessing that's millimeters and the different guides are for varying thickness of hair based on their designs. If you're good with guides then you'll like these. The Panasonic listed above comes with the one-piece guide that adjusts by dialing it which is pretty handy, but it pops off when you go to the longer lengths. That doesn't happen with these Philips guides.It also comes with 4 different blade types for detailing/preference/nose etc...I'll mention here in case anyone has the problem I had. The blade can be washed off as can the top part of the inner trimmer. There are hex type screws in the default blade, which I spent 20 minutes trying to remove. If there's any fault with these it's the lack of instructions. All mine had with it was a leaflet that showed the features. I tried pulling the blade which would be similar to the Panasonic trimmers, but that didn't work either. I finally entered a youtube search and found a video review that showed how to remove the blade/head. It's this easy ... you give it a 1/4 twist and it pops right off. Figures, I was thinking it was going to be something complicated. The blade/head goes back on the same way in opposite order.This set of trimmers are travel-friendly as well. All of the guides, the charger, the trimmer itself fits nicely in the provided pouch. The battery life is about the same as the other trimmers I've tried. If they are fully charged I can go a full week without charging them. I use them 2-3 times a week.

"Edit: 10/22Below is my glowing review of the graphite colored Under Armour Blitzing II Cap. I've had sizing issues with caps for the last several years, but the graphite XL/XXL finally fit and fit comfortably. I really liked it enough to order the black color and was planning on ordering the navy as well. The black one came yesterday and it's made differently. I studied over it trying to figure it out. I wear my caps in a fairly straight line style on the side of my head so they come just above my eyebrows. The black XL/XXL is too tight and my regular hat size is 7 3/4 which is the lower end of the XL/XXL size range. From looking at the hats side by side it looks like the graphite color has a slightly higher crown and that would agree with the fit since the black feels too tight on the front side of my head back through the crown area. As someone who spends way too much time looking for clothes/caps/shoes that fit me properly, I have to wonder if the black and navy colors in this hat are just direct copies of the Blitzing I Cap which ran small?  I'll give one of the other newer colors a try and post another edit. Don't let this push anyone away from this hat as it really is one of the best caps I've ever worn, but there's definitely something going on with the sizing.Original review: It may or may not be hard to believe, but I had all but gave up on baseball caps. The last cap I had that fit just right was a New Era 5950 from years ago. It was before the flatbill design become popular. Ever since then it seems like no one makes hats like they used to including New Era. I have a handful of New Era reviews here on Amazon of the 3930 which was supposed to be a lower crown, better fitting, curved bill hat, but I went through 4 different sizes without finding a single one that fit right. I've never had much success with stretch hats because I wear a 7 3/4. Most stretch fit hats I've tried in the L/XL size or too tight even though the size range goes up to 7 3/4. That's the problem though, right? My size is the highest size available in stretch fit. I've seen a few stretch fit hats that have the XL/XXL size, but think my own frustration with caps just pushed me away. I have looked for Under Armour's XL/XXL size for over a year. This includes going in every sporting goods store I can find, but never see this big size. Even Under Armour's website sporadically gets the XL/XXL size in, but it's usually in red or baby blue. I prefer a dark gray, black or navy hat.So with my birthday nearing my wife was looking for something to get me from the kids and saw where Amazon had the XL/XXL in stock. She ordered me the Graphite color. It came last night. I cringed as I started to put it on figuring it would either be way too big or too tight. It fits perfect. Comfortably. I no longer have to push the bill up a little to relieve the tight hat band. I wore it for four hours last night. No red line across the forehead when I took it off. I kind of feel bad since the size range for this hat is 7 3/4 - 8 1/8, meaning it fits me perfect and I'm a 7 3/4, so anyone wearing bigger than 7 3/4 may have trouble with the sizing, but at least it fits 7 3/4. I would think the next two sizes above 7 3/4 would fit pretty well too. Still, be warned ahead of time, if you're much over a 7 3/4 it might be too tight.Otherwise, the quality of this hat is excellent. I was only interested in the Blitzing line as I like the logo better than the sticker logo I've seen on some UA hats. I love it so much that I have already placed an order for the black one as well and most likely will get the navy one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB1K5OAN2URTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2TIBYK#wasThisHelpful","RB1K5OAN2URTU","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a teenager back when the original Nike Air Max 95s came out and loved them back then. I originally was a Jordan-lover back when the first pairs of Air Jordans came out and that carried on every year up until the Nike Air Max Bo Jackson crosstrainer came out in 1989 (I think). From then through the late 90s, you wouldn't catch me out in anything except Air Max or Jordans. Moving on to current times, I've of course aged and while I don't consider my sense of style to be that much different than it was back then, I mostly have been wearing running shoes from New Balance and Brooks. My review history is littered with reviews of different shoes I've bought here on Amazon only to have to return them due to them not fitting me right. I've also accumulated a long list of over 10 breaks/serious sprains to my legs and ankles since the 90s.My mom lives with my wife and I and our kids. She watched a few months ago as I tried on another pair of running shoes, believe it was Asics, and saw me again shaking my head no while saying, ""Doesn't feel right"". She out of nowhere says, ""Why did you stop wearing Jordans?"" I'm guessing she's noticed that our 11 year old son loves Jordans just like I did. I shrugged my shoulders, ""Not for sure"". So while I was looking for a pair of Jordans that didn't look like a neon Christmas tree, I found these Air Max 95s. I really wanted the Obsidian color, but couldn't find them anywhere in my size. I went with these nice wolf grey ones. For well over a decade, I wore a 10.5 in all Nike shoes. I knew I needed bigger than that, but didn't know what size to try. I ordered an 11 and 12 in them with the intention of returning whichever pair didn't fit. There's the bad news. Neither pair fit. No matter how hard I tried to relace them, to loosen them, the width just wasn't working with my foot. I think it's because of the thick sides on the shoe.Needless to say, I finally found a Jordan shoe I liked and ordered them in an 11.5. Those fit perfect. It was the Jordan Retro 6 Chrome if you're wondering. These Air Maxs are still really nice and even comfortable even when too tight. I don't think you could roll your ankles in these shoes if you tried. Which is the same thing that I think stops them from fitting my foot width. They are very sturdy. I would compare the build quality to the best work boots I've wore and those run in the three hundred dollar range. Very nice looking too. They grey has a sleek look to it. Arch support is excellent so if you can fit these then I would recommend them. If you're having trouble fitting them in width give the Jordan Retro line a try. They're a little more expensive, but not much more. Oh and I'm not too old to wear either one. I saw my old basketball coach from high school wearing some Retro Jordans just a few days ago. I'm back to believing if you want durable, well-made shoes you're going to have to pay more and then you can expect more. This Air Max would have easily lived up to my expectations if not for the width issue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJMYO19F2J5D3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXWGNE8#wasThisHelpful","RJMYO19F2J5D3","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I rarely if ever write 1 star reviews, but it's mostly because I don't review movies we watch. I'll admit ahead of time, I'm no movie expert or even a qualified critic of movies, but I felt like my wife and I wasted night one of our ""scary movie month"" on this movie. A few years ago, my wife gave in and agreed to watch some horror movies. She had made it 30 or so years without ever seeing a single horror movie. My experience with horror movies were the classics like Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and so on. She really liked the original versions of the Halloween movies, but didn't care for the gore in most of the ones we watched. We missed out on scary movie month last year due to us moving during October. I decided to let her pick out some this year. Even though this was officially night one's movie, we also watched ""A Cabin in the Woods"" recommended by Amazon a few nights ago.Like most people I figured this Annabelle was some sort of Child's Play knockoff, but it's not. I also noticed that the doll is somewhat reminiscent of Linda Blair in The Exorcist and sure enough this movie is about demonic possession. I really struggle with these types of movies. I also have trouble with most Science-Fiction movies as well. I've spent most of my life working in logic and reality (Engineering). It's hard for me to tap into a ""I believe that"" feeling with most movies. Like Child's Play. I never really got the scare of it.So, the story of this movie isn't too bad, but it's one of those that you'll feel like you already know what is going to happen. The acting is poor. The mother in it isn't the least bit believable. I'm guessing that's a case of overacting. More importantly, the movie really is very slow. I told my wife, ""I feel like I'm watching Leave it to Beaver"". As the movie panned around the setting city. It has maybe 2-3 ""jump scare"" moments in it, but those are even tame. I didn't see anything in this movie that warranted the ""horror"" label. It's a drama movie with a ""creepy"" doll in it. It's Poltergeist without the true feeling of helplessness of Poltergeist. I also don't know why it's rated R. I honestly think you could play this movie uncut on network television. Not that I was looking for rated R moments, but it's almost as if that rating was put in place to make it more scary than it actually is. My wife chose this movie based on the doll. I've tried to get her to watch Puppet Master, but she's always saying the puppets freak her out. Which is what I always thought the point of a horror movie was. This one will just make you wish you could move time back 99 minutes and not push play.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24HAMF87OWTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4UWVYA#wasThisHelpful","R24HAMF87OWTF","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Awhile back, I decided to convert from a console gamer to a PC gamer. I had a few exceptions. Sports games aren't released on the PC as often as the console, so I kept my Xbox 360 just for sports games. I wasn't impressed with what I saw of Madden 16, so I instead bought Madden 15. My last Madden was Madden 13.My main gripe with football games is the difficulty or lack of. From the earliest days of sports licensed games (late 80s - early 90s), I've rarely found a sports game that is challenging, unless you set the difficulty very high. Then as most know, it becomes a game of frustration and patience as you watch computer AI opponents become with 12 foot jumping interceptions, being blocked by two players only to squeeze between them and get a sack ... two, three times a game. Madden was never my favorite as I preferred the NCAA football game. With no new NCAA games, Madden 15 would have to be my football gaming fix this year.Sadly, any thought of a challenge disappeared during my first exhibition game. I'll never understand the ""realism"" other people find in these football games. In my first exhibition game, I used the Chicago Bears against the Detroit Lions. I didn't touch any of the sliders or settings (penalties, stamina, quarter length). It's my belief that the default settings and sliders should give the most realistic result. Sliders, to me, were there for when you had played 3-4 seasons and had gotten too good at the game to have realistic results. Settings, especially quarter length, was for stat lovers who wanted a little extra time to pick up their players stats. My first game result with default sliders and settings:Chicago Bears 45 - Detroit Lions 10Notable players stats:Jay Cutler 14-16 passing, 286 yards, 2 TDs, 0 INTsMatt Stafford 6-22 passing, 57 yards, 1 TD, 3 INTsMatt Forte 13 rushes, 178 yards, 2 TDsJacquizz Rodgers 6 rushes, 84 yards, 2 TDsJoique Bell 15 rushes, 12 yardsBears defense 11 sacks, 6 turnovers (3 INTs, 3 fumbles recovered)Total yards:Bears 568Lions 115I don't think I need to explain how unrealistic these stats are. The worst part for me is the quarter length setting. If you look at the Bears QB and RB combined with the Lions QB and RB, there was only 38 passes between the two teams and 28 rushes between the two teams top RBs. To put some perspective on that, when these two teams played last year with the near exact rosters as I'm using in this game, those two QBs combined for 93 passes attempted and the two teams combined for 31 rushing attempts. That means in the real game the two teams ran right at double the plays as the same two teams ran on Madden 15. I'll agree that video game football is supposed to be a little more geared towards big, exciting plays than long drawn out drives, but to get the stats to match or even be close between Madden and real-life results, one would need to play 12 minute quarters. Just prorating the stats I had in the 6 minute quarters, that would have made the score Bears 90 Lions 20. Cutler would have had nearly 600 yards passing, Forte would have been over 300 yards. The teams would have nearly 1,500 total yards combined.I adjusted the sliders making the game ""harder"". The only big difference I saw was the number of interceptions I was throwing. I was still rushing at will with any team and with any running back. Outside of turning the difficulty up to Madden level and adjusting all sliders to make the computer AI defense as good as possible, I was still carrying the ball at a 10+ yards average per rush. It's pretty sad when you have to spend the second half of the game making negative rushes just to lower your RBs yards per carry to a believable level. The pass defense AI isn't much better. I even tried making the game feel a little more challenging by intentionally throwing the ball out of bounds for an incomplete pass for my QBs stats and so my offense would have only two plays to get a first down.It's frustrating when you have to play a game the opposite of how it should be played just so you won't feel like you're just wasting your time. If all this is a little confusing or hard to understand, I decided to play a full season with 8 minute quarters, All-Pro difficulty, all sliders adjusted to favor the computer AI opponent. This was the result:Bears 16-0 in regular season. Won the Super Bowl.Jay Cutler 6,008 yards - Broke all-time single season record by 600 yards.Cutler 58 TDs passing, 7 INTs - Broke all-time single season passing TDs record.Forte 2,673 yards rushing - Broke all-time single season rushing yards record by 500 yards.Forte 31 rushing TDs - Broke all-time single season rushing TD record.Jeffrey 2,217 receiving yards - Broke all-time single season receiving yards record.To make all this even worse, the Bears also had these stats:Rodgers the second string RB had 1,426 yards with 14 TDs, the yards ranked 3rd in the NFL and the rushing TDs also ranked 3rd.Bennett the Bears Tight End had 1,729 yardsRoyal the Bears #2 WR had 1,256 yardsAs a lifelong Bears fan I can tell you those stats aren't even close to being accurate. It's more believable for me to say those are the least accurate stats possible. Needless to say, I put the game back in its case and it's not likely that I'll play it again. I would like to think it's just my general football knowledge that allows me to post these type of stats, but I do the same on all of EA's sports games including FIFA, and I've never even played soccer nor do I even understand the majority of soccer's penalties. I really believe these EA sports games aren't being tested enough.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VH8C9S7A8X1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUFSH6U#wasThisHelpful","R3VH8C9S7A8X1W","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought both WWE 2K14 and 2K15. My review of 2K14 can be found in my history.I rate this one higher even though I don't think most gamers do. I'm going to explain the differences.The Create a Finisher is gone. The Create a Story is gone.The roster is much better in 2K15. The NXT and Showcase modes are relatively fun.Most of what I had read must have been based around WWE 2K15 on the XBone and PS4. This is a near carbon copy of 2K14 on the Xbox 360. You can still Create Divas in the 360 version. No match options were removed, it's exactly the same as 2K14 match options.One negative is the Community Creations community isn't near as active on 2K15. You can download pretty much any wrestler you can name on 2K14's Community Creations, not so on 2K15, but there's still some good created wrestlers, especially if you like Indy wrestling. If you're into International wrestling, then you would probably prefer 2K14's Community Creations. 2K15 has 1-2 created versions of the biggest name international wrestlers like Great Muta, Cibernetico, Liger, and you're as likely to find 1 bad one for every 1 good one.I had read ""limited creation functions"", but that doesn't apply as much on the 360. It hasn't changed since 2K14. What has changed is how Community Creations works. On 2K14, you can download the max 100 wrestlers if you want to in one night. On 2K15 it limits you to 10 downloads per 24 hour period. There's a simple way around it, but the way around the limit doesn't work if you're downloading logos, arenas, move-sets. It's a little annoying, but the default roster had at least 20 wrestlers in it that I had to download on 2K14.The game plays smoothly, character models are a little crisper than in 2K14 and I don't feel as distracted when playing it as I did in 2K14. I kept wanting to create a story, create a finisher, I just knew I would figure out how to make a finisher that didn't look herky jerky, but it didn't work. This 2K15 has more moves since it retains all the moves from 2K14 and adds all the moves for the new wrestlers who weren't in last year's game. Since I don't watch wrestling much, most of the moves are new to me so I didn't miss the create a finisher option.Other complaints I've seen on 2K15 is the removal of custom entrance music and the custom entrances only include one generic motion. Those are both right. I usually play wrestling or even fighting games for an hour or so and it's just to relax. I turn the entrances to off. So those removed features aren't noticeable to the way I play the game. But they are gone for those who do like custom music and custom entrances. Both features were in 2K14.It just came down to me preferring this roster over 2K14's. It's a good wrestling game. I will say it's not as good as those old wrestling games on the N64. But I've been saying that about every wrestling game I've played since Wrestlemania 2000, No Mercy and the WCW vs games on the N64. This 2K15 is the better buy of the two as I ended up sinking fifty dollars in a used version of 2K14, whereas I only spent the price for 2K15 plus 2 DLCs that were only seven dollars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X0CHGUV0E2SX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBZHSUY#wasThisHelpful","R1X0CHGUV0E2SX","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hadn't played a wrestling game since SD vs. Raw 2010. I also haven't followed wrestling for awhile. My son watches a few of the programs each week, but most of what I saw wasn't very interesting. I grew up with the 80s Saturday night wrestling shows with Gordon Solie as announcer, Sunday was WWF/E and even rented the VHS of Wrestlemania I just a few months after it originally happened. I really loved wrestling. Our son is back and forth with it. So there's really not been a reason to buy the games. I hadn't realized 2K had taken over the WWE series until a few weeks ago. That, if nothing else, made me interested in the game since I believe 2K still has developed the best NFL game ever ... in NFL 2K5. And I've enjoyed several of the more current NBA 2K games.The roster had very little impact on my choice of which WWE game to get. Despite being a fan during the 80s and through the Attitude Era, I'm not really into using the wrestlers from those eras, especially those who've passed away. I was more interested in having a fun game. Everything I read on wrestling games forums said 2K14 is better than 2K15, so I ordered a used version, not knowing I would need to buy an online pass since the one included was used by the previous owner.So, I ended up paying ten more dollars for an online pass. Then ended up buying the Season Pass which was another twenty dollars. I really didn't mind the price since I figured it would be enough to last my wrestling game interest for a few years. The game is good, but it's really not that different than I remember the THQ WWE games being. It's a reversal-fest. I ended up lowering the reversal slider all the way down to just one level of it. It was pretty annoying to hit a finisher, pick the guy up and have him reverse your next move. There's plenty of match types to play. And though the roster didn't matter much to me in the beginning, it started to matter once I played the game. I ended up going to the community creations and downloading roughly 90 created wrestlers since there's a lot of active wrestlers not in this game. I would think most notably for current WWE fans, The Wyatt Family. There's some really great created wrestlers in the community creations.We played it off and on for a week or so, but the roster, even with added created wrestlers, just isn't very good. The best created wrestlers don't look much better than the worst default characters. I would rate this higher, but I turned around and bought a new copy of WWE 2K15 for the 360 and liked it quite a bit better. I wouldn't rate either one a five star. There's problems in these games that were around back in 2010. From collision detection, floating wrestlers, a very ambitious ""create a finisher"" that ends up making you think they really don't put much time into it. Create a Story isn't any better than I remember it being. It more or less reminds me of most sports video games. They update the roster, throw a few new animations in and say it's a new game. I'm also going to review 2K15 as well. A quick ending piece of advice. Only buy used if you're willing to pay the money for the online access which you have to have to download created wrestlers. You also have to have Xbox Gold. I tried a free trial week to the online access only to find out it wouldn't let me download any created wrestlers during the trial. If you buy a new copy it will come with the online access code. One last warning on this one. The server has been having problems for the last 2 weeks. I spent a week trying to download a Great Muta created wrestler only to receive this message, ""The WWE 2K14 service is not available. Try again later."" From what I've read they'll most likely shut the server down in the next few months anyway.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RNZT6I513SXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMC6HZ6#wasThisHelpful","R3RNZT6I513SXL","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the easiest, cheapest and no-fuss ways to help rid your house of household odors. Our daughter's closet is in the most humid area of our house. With summer temperatures hitting at least 90 for 35 straight days this year she was starting to complain about how her closet smelled. It doesn't help that we've been making her and her brother wash their own clothes. She had an entire mesh laundry bag in her closet filled with wet towels and dirty sheets. She forgot them before going on vacation with my wife's family. Since neither sheets or towels are something she had to take on vacation with her, she left them there for two weeks. We ordered this Moso bag and put it in there. Washed the dirty sheets and towels, now the closet is back to smelling neutral. And here's another tip for these. My first experience with these bags was in my job. We had remodeled a house that was over 100 years old. This required cutting some of the walls out. A few days after opening those old walls up we noticed a musty smell and bought some of these 200g bags, mounted them to the bottom of the walls we left in place. It removed the smell and because of the hole in the 200g bag, the new owners can replace them in the future if they want.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38QFKY4P34FF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BOH6BM#wasThisHelpful","R38QFKY4P34FF3","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These have been great for my mom. She's in her late 60s and bruises easily on her hands, wrists and forearms. Recently she had a fairly bad slip that caused a light globe to break on her hand.

Here's hoping they keep working. She's tried just about everything from a similar pair of hand/forearm protectors made by Under Armour for use by football players to the various different bruises creams.

"I said I wouldn't have buyer's remorse after buying this. Like most FNM fans I've been around since the late 80s when they had their smash hit with ""Epic"". I've since became a follower of Mike Patton's musical adventures, all the way from FNM through Mr. Bungle to Tomahawk and back around by Fantomas. I've enjoyed every step despite some of them making me wonder if I just like to see what crazy thing Mike is going to do with his voice. With FNM you're getting mostly great music on all albums with a few of those more experimental songs thrown in.This deluxe edition really offers very little to any FNM collector. The Angel Dust album is one of the finest mastered albums I've heard and they didn't mess with the sound much if at all. The bonus disc is good, but there's also a chance you've already heard everything on it. It's surprising they left out, ""The Perfect Crime"" from Bill and Ted, but most of us have it already.If you don't have Angel Dust already then I'll recommend this deluxe edition wholeheartedly, but if you already have it then you might want to look at disc two to see if it's worth purchasing.

Good buy for anyone who has an ID they have to use everyday, but don't want to carry a purse or wallet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30V6W3B3EGC1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOKVYNY#wasThisHelpful","R30V6W3B3EGC1K","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, I had bought another product by this company that wasn't for cool-mist humidifiers. This one says it is. I used it for a week and noticed no difference in the humidifier staying cleaner longer. From the way it reads it's supposed to stop the white dust. I already fixed that problem by using water from a filter. So I can't really say if it stops white dust, but can say it doesn't stop pink gunk from forming in the humidifier. As another warning like on the other product, this product also has multiple warnings on it about not letting it touch your skin. No doubt, the dilution of it would lower those risks, but it still seems crazy to put something in a cool mist humidifier that can hurt you by touching you. I found the combination of the Protec cartridges and filtered water from the faucet filter has slowed the pink gunk and white dust better than anything else.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FWGQ3SS7UI7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009GVYCI#wasThisHelpful","R3FWGQ3SS7UI7T","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Years ago I used these in a Vicks humidifier I had. They did seem to make the filter last longer, but I was curious to see how they would work in an ultrasonic cool mist humidifier. We've bought at least 5 humidifiers this year from Amazon (reviews in my history). The main problem I have with humidifiers is the pink gunk that builds up in them. I bought this pack that includes 2 of the cartridges. Cleaned my mom's humidifier and dropped one into the tank. Cleaned my purifier and dropped the other into it.I can say it's working. I'm only giving four stars because I think this is a long-term experiment. I kept a note on how long the clean humidifiers lasted before starting to show pink gunk with and without the cartridge.Without this cartridge, the Optimus humidifier my mom is using, had pink gunk in it 4 days after cleaning. It was needing cleaned by the 6th day without the cartridge. With the cartridge, the Optimus humidifier hasn't shown much pink gunk in 10 days after cleaning, but there is a little. Still, that's a big improvement.Without this cartridge my Pure Guardian humidifier showed pink gunk in it 5 days after cleaning and needed cleaned in 6 days after cleaning without the cartridge. With the cartridge, the Pure Guardian is showing no pink gunk at all in 10 days after cleaning.I should mention, I'm like most of you all. The idea of buying gallons of distilled water just for my humidifier wasn't a good option. I bought one of the faucet water filters (PUR, Culligan, etc) and have been filling them with the filtered water which I'm sure is also helping. I'll update this review a few more times over the next few months to see if the cartridge keeps working, how long it lasts, etc..","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PAHDQGS4RKUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XPT0DK#wasThisHelpful","R2PAHDQGS4RKUJ","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have this really great story about this bag, but won't go too overboard with it. Our daughter bought this for her best friend. I checked it before giving it to her to make sure the smell wasn't bad. It wasn't, I was going to put a Odoban odor remover in the plastic bag if it was. Her best friend has a lot of serious medical problems, but she's completely positive. This bag became a new part of her ""support system"" she created. She wears it on her back when she has to stay overnight in a hospital or when she's having surgery. She says the bag helps her because she feels better knowing, ""the turtles have my back"". I'm afraid if I told the full story it would make some people cry. Just take it for it's worth. It's a good quality bag for the price.

"I can't really rate this lower than five stars. We bought the Culligan faucet filter with the belief that we would use it a whole lot. There's one problem. The water is room temperature. I've mainly been using the faucet filter for ice, coffee for mom, iced tea for everyone, water for the dogs and for filling our humidifiers. We didn't have any trouble changing them and the water quality is very good. We are averaging 3 months of use out of ours between changes.

"Excellent quality. I bought this for my mom. She's in her 60s and was talking to me one day about her hair thinning. She asked me if I remembered the hair brush she had when I was a little kid. I knew exactly what she was talking about and came here to Amazon to find one. It was a completely blind order since I wanted to surprise her with it. She loves it and says it doesn't pull her already thinning hair out. On the other side, our 13 year old daughter has very thick hair and tried it out. She too loved it so we bought her one too. I'm bald so I don't know much about brushes. I do know it seems like every few months my wife is buying our daughter a new brush because the old brush is either hurting her head to use or isn't working good anymore.

"I got this for my mom to use with her Chromebook. I have been a convert to the Bluetrack mice for several years now and this is one of the cheapest ways to get one. I think it's probably the cheapest way. I wouldn't be able to use it myself since it's rather small, but works perfect for mom. If anyone is wondering how well the bluetrack works, I'll tell you how I've used them. I sit in a recliner type chair at my computer so I can't depend on using the mouse on my desk or mouse pad. I use it daily on my shorts/pants made from denim, polyester, cotton, khaki. I've used it on the arm of my chair it's made of leather. My mom uses hers on her quilt on her bed. I've not tried it on glass mainly because outside of the windows, we don't have any glass furniture to test it on. Our daughter has used it on the floor which is laminate. In our experience these are the best and cheapest mice you can buy if you're not a traditional mouse on desk/mouse pad user of computers.

"I've become an almost exclusive user of TP-Link's products. This one won't hurt my opinion of them. We have the TL-PA4010KIT and the Archer C8 Router. My wife was wanting something to extend our WiFi into our kitchen, it's on the far end of the house away from the rooms we typically need internet in. She first ordered the TP-Link RE200, but all it really did was hurt the already poor WiFi reception in our kitchen. I built our current house and intended for the kitchen to be electronics/screens-free. My mom lives with us and is retired. She loves to take our kids into the kitchen, cook with them, have them test out her cookies or whatever she's in the mood to cook, but she despises computers/phones in the kitchen. She does like technology everywhere else though. My wife started taking online classes since we moved in and now needs internet in the kitchen so she can study in peace.With no RE200 or this WPA4220 we were getting 1-2 MB/sec at the kitchen table.The RE200 actually dropped us below 1 MB/sec at the kitchen table.I realized my wife had ordered the wrong product since it was giving what I call a ""ghost"" signal. Our phones, laptops were all saying they had full WiFi reception, but the speeds were just terrible. We can get upwards of 75 MB/sec in the bedrooms.Since I had experience with the 4010, I knew it should be better than what she was getting and finally found this WPA4220. I'll be completely honest and say it doesn't get as much speed in the kitchen as I would like, but it's still getting a consistent 25-30 MB/sec with the WPA4220 plugged in the hallway which is halfway between the router and kitchen.When I built this house I set out to make it WiFi friendly and ran most of the wiring, metal on the end with the kitchen with minimal shielded wiring throughout the bedrooms and bathrooms. It has worked good for what I intended. This WPA4220 does a good enough job. I knew expectations couldn't be too high since the hallway leads right into heavy wiring in the walls, so 25-30 MB/sec is probably lucky. I gave it 5 stars based on my knowledge of the house's wiring and my intentional attempt to lower WiFi accessibility in our kitchen to start with. It saved me a lot of time of going into the attic and rewiring everything.One tip: My wife is impatient. She plugged this in the kitchen and expected it to pair up with the router which is roughly 40 feet away. She was ready to send it back since it wouldn't even pair. I took it to our bedroom where the router is, pushed the WPS button on the router, plugged this in maybe 5 feet away and held the connect button for probably a minute. It paired up and has been working fine in the hallway ever since. I also think it's important to plug this into an outlet and not a surge protector. I originally had a problem with the 4010KIT since I tried plugging it into a surge protector.Very good product overall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21BW5WWM2PGF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEFYTMK#wasThisHelpful","R21BW5WWM2PGF3","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those reviews that I'm almost embarrassed to publish. Let me say I've been an RPG gamer for as long as I can remember. I still remember putting The Legend of Zelda on NES in layaway back in 1986. My dad wouldn't let me pay over twenty dollars for a video game back then and if I remember right, it was fifty. I was only eleven or twelve. I paid on it every other week until I had it in my hands and spent the entire summer playing it. A second major game came along in summer of 1990. Final Fantasy on the NES. I spent that summer playing it. So much in fact, I even loaded up the NES, the game, the maps and took them on vacation with us.The Elder Scrolls replaced both of those for me. Even as an overworked dad and husband, I've developed what I consider a healthy obsession with the Elder Scrolls and Fallout too. The Elder Scrolls games let me get away from the stress of daily life. I recently made the switch from console gamer to PC gamer and bought this set while Amazon had it on sale for twenty dollars. I figured I wouldn't use it since I do like Steam, but wanted this set anyway. I now own these versions of the Elder Scrolls games:Skyrim: (Xbox 360) Vanilla and Legendary, (PS3) Legendary, (PC) Steam LegendaryOblivion: (Xbox 360) Game of the Year with all downloaded add-ons like Vile Lair, (PC) Steam Deluxe Game of the Year Edition and this physical copy.Morrowind: (Xbox) Game of the Year played on Xbox 360For me, these three games become completely ""new"" on PC. This is the order of my favorites of these three and it's important to the review.Skyrim - On console it has been the best of the three for me. I don't care for the leveling up system in it, but the combination of graphics, realistic gore, story and atmosphere makes it my favorite.Morrowind - A game I had trouble liking at first on the console. It feels a little clunky, everything you ""see"" is outdated, but the leveling up is very fun, the atmosphere is good despite the lower-end graphics and the story is good.Oblivion - To me it's the most overrated on consoles. Skyrim's setting is near perfect. It's icy, it's cold, there are animals you would expect to see in cold areas. Morrowind is dark and moody which fits it well. Oblivion is set in Cyrodill and it's similar to North America in climate with the southern region being marshy, lots of water, the central region being green and flat, both coasts have water all along them and the northern parts get into mountainous, snowy conditions, but that's it. It's as if they created this beautiful lush continent for Oblivion, but forgot to add much to the outside parts of the game. You can run across half of Oblivion's map without being attacked once. There are wolves, the occasional Minotaur, but most of the outside area seems wasted.Having said that, Oblivion on the PC has the most potential since the modding community has added thousands of mods for it. More wildlife, even lusher graphics, it's kind of like taking Skyrim's outdoor adventures and adding it to Oblivion. I've already played the modded PC version for 114 hours. I barely had that much on the console version and I'm nowhere near finished with the PC version.Morrowind has the great graphics overhaul mod. Though I agree with other Elder Scrolls players who say you should play Morrowind without it at least for one playthrough. The mod makes it prettier, it takes away some of the dark atmosphere, but it makes it much nicer to look at it and easier on your eyes. There's also weapon and armor mods that improve those.Skyrim falls to the bottom on the PC since in my opinion, it was the best on console, there's some nice graphic mods for weapons and armor, but it was already near perfect for me, not counting the too easy leveling up system.I've been very happy with this anthology. As others have noted, the Skyrim that comes with this set is a Steam code. Also should be noted, the Oblivion that comes with this set is the Game of the Year edition. I had already bought the Deluxe GotY edition on Steam which includes those small add-ons like Vile Lair, Wizard's Tower, etc...I've read others say if you install Oblivion GotY from this set through Steam you'll get the Deluxe Edition, but I can't verify that since I already had it downloaded to my Steam account before buying this set. I also agree with the others who say you really don't ""need"" this anthology if you already have these games on Steam. I haven't tried Daggerfall or Arena, but will eventually. All in all, combining the console versions and PC versions, I've put in over 1,200 hours in these 3 games over the last 5-6 years. I probably still have another 1,200 hours to go with all these mods.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27Q7LNM4QEODL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9I1FPI#wasThisHelpful","R27Q7LNM4QEODL","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fourth Bubba mug I've bought. There's not a lot of reason to review these except there can be some confusion.There are two different 34 oz Bubba mugs.

Then there's the one picture above with the skinnier bottom which fits in all cupholders I've tried (loveseat console, truck's dashboard one, wife's car cupholder).You can see in my review history that I bought another 34 oz one that doesn't say ""travel"" in the title, but it was the travel one which is what I wanted. I then ordered a second one from the same page I ordered from, but instead received the uniform, thicker mug. I have ordered two from this travel mug page you're on and received the travel mug both times.It's a very good, sturdy mug that keeps drinks cold for several hours.

"I recently posted a review of an Oral-B S-200. I don't even think I was posting Amazon reviews back when I bought it on Amazon in 2007. It lasted up until a few weeks ago. So, I really didn't have any question about what brand electric toothbrush I was going to buy. Eight years of daily service is enough to make me forget my analytical ways.You'll have to understand that I was very happy to receive this. I used the S-200 for 8 years, 2 times a day, without skipping a day. That is until the S-200 stopped charging. I still only missed one day of using an electric toothbrush.The first thing I did when I received this toothbrush was replace the head. I have very sensitive gums. I bought the 3 pack of Oral-B's Power Sensitive Replacement Heads. My first use of the brush went better than expected. The motion of this model is much more along the lines of what I need from an electric toothbrush. The round head allows me to control the areas of my brushing. I do still brush my teeth with a regular brush 2-3 times a day. I use the electric toothbrush similar to how most people use floss. I want it to specifically hit along my gum line and this model's round head does that perfectly. Much better than the S-200's traditional style toothbrush head. While I can appreciate the timer ""pulse"" (the S-200 also had it), I've never really followed it. I cover my gum line all across the top and bottom teeth then go over my teeth once.A few problems I've learned to work with: We have three electric toothbrushes in our household. There's nothing that bothers me more than seeing gunk building up around the charging base. This can be simply avoided by wiping the toothbrush's handle down after every use. I know it sounds simple and you might be thinking ""who doesn't do that?"", but if you look at the reviews there's quite a few complaints about the charger base gunk.As much as I like the storage area that comes with this model, it's not staying hooked onto my charger's base. I keep it in the cabinet above the sink. It not only takes up more space on your sink with it attached, it also promotes water/bacteria around the base if you're switching heads frequently since the heads most likely won't be dried out when you switch them out.The only real choice I had to make was which model of the Oral-B I was going to buy. I started with a small list the toothbrush had to have or didn't need.Bluetooth - I don't even use bluetooth on my phone or computer. I didn't look into what the bluetooth function does, but did know I don't need it.More than one speed - As said above, I use this specifically for my gum line. All I really need though is the regular speed (for teeth) and the slower, sensitive speed for my gums.Doesn't come with a big charging base - My wife and I have separate sinks, but even so, I don't like sink clutter of any kind.The Pro 1000 model didn't have the separate speed settings so I removed it. The Pro 5000 model has bluetooth and the word ""smart"" in front of toothbrush. I'm all for technology as you can see in my review history, but technology has very little reason to be involved with my teeth cleaning. It made picking the 3000 model an easy choice and on top of that, there was a twenty dollar off coupon on it. Which was enough to cover the cost of the sensitive replacement heads.One thing I haven't mentioned is this model also comes with a ""pulse"" speed setting. I tried it. Didn't care for it. So it does have three speeds. This model is a good balance between the higher priced models and the lower priced models, though if you don't need a sensitive speed setting, I would recommend the Pro 1000. If you like the flexibility of 3 speeds and a charging base that can be easily taken apart so it's only a small, portable base, I would recommend this Pro 3000 model. Here's hoping for another 8 years of daily use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17DCM398T5SUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UKKHB4#wasThisHelpful","R17DCM398T5SUO","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's never fun talking about grooming body hair. I started shaving off most of my body hair when I was in college. I played multiple sports in college and having less hair always made my body cooler and less likely to have hair pulling in my uniform.In college, I shaved all body hair except my chest. It was hell. That was in the 90s. I used to take a bottle of Nair and rub it all across my back, shoulders, legs and arms. Then would take a wet towel and rub the hair as hard as I could to remove the body hair. If it sounds painful, it was. Also, I would smell like Nair (which smells like rotten eggs to me) all day. I eventually found the Mangroomer product at one of the Bed, Bath stores and thought I had found the answer to my body hair problem. And I did ... sort of. It worked well on my back, but would cause major irritation. My back would look sunburned. And yes, it was also painful like a sunburn. Believe it or not, I still have that original Mangroomer and it still works.But, I've changed my body grooming since then. I no longer shave my legs or arms since my wife likes that hair. This leaves me with a smaller area to shave and I picked up a sample of these Body razors a few months ago. My wife used one on my back and I'm happy to say there was nearly no irritation. I did have another problem that I didn't have with the Mangroomer and that was a small skin tag I didn't know I had on my back. It bled pretty bad, but wasn't near as painful as the irritation the Mangroomer caused. I think it's a good product. It does look a lot like the razors my wife and daughter use, but that doesn't matter too much to me. I decided to order this two pack when I saw the special promo Amazon has on them. I'll put them up for future use since this Amazon price is nearly half off what I see them for in stores.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RMMTHFYZTS4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HF3XU8E#wasThisHelpful","R2RMMTHFYZTS4C","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife bought these for her own use. She had a pair of Tweezerman tweezers that were lost. I really don't know what all women use tweezers for and honestly, don't really want to know. I use tweezers if I get a splinter. I was surprised when she ordered these. We have an Amazon system in our house. My wife, kids and mom all sign into my account when they are ordering something. They put the items in the cart then I check the next day. Look to see if there's anything else we need and place the order. The last time I looked there were two pairs of Tweezerman tweezers in the cart, but my wife had sent a text telling me not to order them yet. She had found these Bodyline tweezers and wanted to read up on them when she got time. She of course decided to buy these. She wasn't happy with them once they came. The main complaint she had was two of the pairs of tweezers don't close all the way. She said that made them useless on very fine thin hairs. The third pair she said were just okay. So she returned them and bought two different pairs of Tweezerman tweezers.As others have said, the seller can be a bit annoying asking for reviews of these tweezers. I received 5 emails asking for a review. The worst part, the first one came the day after I ordered them. Amazon Prime shipping is fast, but it's not that fast. On a side note, as annoying as those emails can be (especially since they came to my account and not my wife's, who was the one using them), I do respect the company for trying to get feedback on their products. Hopefully it's to use the feedback for improvement and not to try and get more people to buy them based on ""good"" reviews.I think I was fair in a 3 star rating. If it were me, the one working pair would have been enough, though that would make it overpriced for one pair. I thought the one pair (non-colored) looked more like a surgical tool than tweezers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVRHGMVI5HCLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXJFPMA#wasThisHelpful","RVRHGMVI5HCLD","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start with a little bit of a warning: I'm bald. But I do have a little stubble on my head after a few days of not shaving and I also have a full beard. I haven't bought a bottle of shampoo in years, even decades. Just from memory, I would guess the last shampoo I bought was in 1993-1994. It was the regular Paul Mitchell in the white bottle. I always liked the pleasant smell of it. So my wife and I were on a weekend getaway. While there, the hotel room had several bottles of complimentary shampoo, conditioner and lotions. One of the shampoos was called Bumble and Bumble Surf Foam. I decided to try it on my beard and loved it. Then I found out how much it costs and decided to find a different shampoo.I typically use whatever shampoo is in our shower. My wife spends a lot of time making sure her best shampoo isn't left in the shower. I saw this Paul Mitchell here on Amazon and Lavender is one of my favorite scents. I had been sold on Paul Mitchell's brand back in the 90s. So I ordered the shampoo and conditioner. The plan was to wash my beard and head/hair every other day. I admit, I was pretty excited about having a lavender shampoo. Then I received it and started to use it. It's not the lavender I know of. As a kid, my grandfather used to have a bowl beside his clothing dresser. He kept warm water in it and dropped lavender in it. It kept his room smelling fresh and clean. He also would rub some on his hands and smack his hands on his face after shaving. He told me it's the only ""perfume"" a man ever needs. I was expecting this to smell something like his lavender water. It doesn't. There's a woodsy smell, a very slight mint smell and a dull lavender scent. It's okay, if it improves the feeling of my beard and stops dryness in the facial hair, it would still be worth the price. It didn't. I'm not saying it doesn't work. My beard and head felt very clean, but it didn't improve the feeling of my beard.My review is more or less based on the smell and how well it cleans/treats. It cleans well. The other two are below average. I'm still giving it a 3 star since I'll finish the bottles. There's nothing offensive or bad about it. It just doesn't live up to the expectations I have on the Paul Mitchell brand.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE5ZHF2TDKGW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BDVPOA#wasThisHelpful","RE5ZHF2TDKGW0","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's not much you can say about these cables. The one thing I will say is I've ordered them more than once. The main selling/return buying point is the snagless feature. My most recent order was of the 7 ft one. The one that came with our router popped loose the first three times I plugged it into our modem. I used that one until this one arrived then replaced it.

"I was surprised to see Dorco on Amazon. I'm a razor/shaving enthusiast. I've been shaving my head for roughly 25 years now. And up until this year (grew a beard), shaved my head and face at least 3 times a week. My wife initially found Harry's razors. I was on their site shopping for some cheaper razors when I noticed someone mentioned Dorco razors. My wife also spends way too much on razors and our daughter is almost 13, she's not shaving often, but does maybe once every two weeks. I signed up on Dorco and received a promo if bought from their website. The promo allowed you to pick multiple razors so it would be something like a sampler. I picked this Pace 6 Plus and a Pace 6. My wife picked the 6 blade women's razors.Wife used hers the first day the order arrived and went on and on about how much she liked it. Daughter used one and said it was as good as any she has used (keeping in mind she's just starting out).Since I have a beard, I've been shaving my head a little less often, maybe twice a week. My thinking was even if these cartridges weren't real good, just shaving my head, they should at least last a week or two with each cartridge. My first shave of my head with these cartridges wasn't bad. I did notice a few spots that hair could still be felt, but not seen, the real test would be how well they do on the second and hopefully third shave. Second shave was 3 days later and it was pretty frustrating. The cartridges kept clogging up. If my hair was very long or even very thick, I could understand, but most of my hair on the top of my head is gone whether I shave it or not. And it was only a 3 day growth on the sides and back of my head. I didn't get any cuts or nicks, but after finishing, there were multiple small patches of stubbly hair still on my head. I tried to get a third shave out of the cartridge, but quit after the first swipe. The cartridge wasn't shaving very well at all. I switched it for the second cartridge that came with the handle. It did okay on the first shave then started having problems on the second shave.I'm learning to just watch for when someone like Amazon has the Proglides at a very good price. I only rated the Proglides a 4 on here so it's not that I'm biased. I just can't deal with an uncomfortable shave. I do work outside, sometimes up in the mountains, which means wind burn, irritation are even more likely so I can't risk it. For a comparison, I bought some cartridges from Sam's called Simply Right Duraglide 6 blade razors. I didn't do well with those either, but would compare them as similar quality. I think the sixth blade is part of the problem. If you've used the Fusion (not Proglides), you know that 5 blades are almost too much since they don't allow for a freeflow of water through the blades. The Proglide version of the Fusion fixes that problem.To further show how much I want these Dorco to work for me, the next time my wife and daughter order cartridge refills, I'm going to order a Pace 4 and 3. I'm old enough to have grown up shaving with 2 and 3 blade razors. Maybe the less blades models will allow more water to get through the blades to wash the hair out. If not, I'll just watch Amazon's prices on the Proglides and order a dozen or so each time they put them on sale.To show a direct comparison: Since I've stopped using razors on my face, a Proglide will last me 6 comfortable shaves of my head. I can push that to 7-8 with a little irritation.The Dorco Pace 6 gets me one comfortable shave.Having said that, it's just my experience. As I said above, my wife and daughter love these cartridges. They just don't work very good for me. I would recommend people to try them. I'll eventually give Harry's a try, but I don't have much confidence in these value razors.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JTZ8LKXE7KCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008O82O7C#wasThisHelpful","R3JTZ8LKXE7KCU","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This won't be much of a review. I bought this on October 17, 2007 here on Amazon and must've skipped reviewing it. The good news is: It has been used at least twice a day since October 17, 2007. The bad news: It just stopped charging yesterday, June 24, 2015. I'm back to buy a replacement one and thought I would post this review. I consider myself a fairly simple man and will be trying to find a new model with the features this one has. I'm already leaning towards the Oral-B Pro-3000. Very impressive lifespan on this one and I'll have to just hope my next one lasts as long as this one. I remember when I bought this one. I couldn't believe an electric toothbrush would make that much difference, but it has. I'm planning on overnight shipping the next one just so I don't have to wait to have my electric toothbrush. I follow a pretty basic mouth cleaning process of: Full two minutes with the electric toothbrush as soon as I get out of bed. Two to three light brushings in the afternoon to evening. Then I used the electric toothbrush before going to bed, followed by a once over with my wife's water irrigation pick. I'll probably regret saying this, but I'm 40 now and haven't had a cavity since my mid-20s and while I gave up on the gleaming white smile, I'm still very happy to have made it this far without any dental problems. I credit this toothbrush for a lot of my oral health.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FJYU2WUYMBMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002M5JNY#wasThisHelpful","R1FJYU2WUYMBMC","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've bought way too many charging cables over the years. Our household includes my elderly mom, my wife and two kids. When my wife upgraded to an iPhone 6 from a iPhone 4s, our son got her 4s to use just for iMessage and as a mp3 player. Mom was the last to upgrade from the 4s. Since there's hardly no value in selling or trading the 4s, I told her I would take it to use as a mp3 player. The standard charging cable that came with her 4s wasn't long enough to reach the back of my computer's USB ports so I needed a longer one to charge it and to register it to my iTunes. This charging cable was priced good and looked like good quality so I ordered it. It has a very good snug fit in the phone, also has the longer length I needed and has worked flawlessly for a few months now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R236JM0UDQ6FI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1KYMEM#wasThisHelpful","R236JM0UDQ6FI","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm always trying to work on my writing style, especially grammar, word usage and it's mostly because I'm a 40 year old dyslexic with a PhD. I generally avoided writing-based classes in my ten years of college. I've tried more than a dozen Kindle books about writing and this was the most educational. It reminds me somewhat of a book I had in college years ago. Had a spiral-bound backing and was required for Composition classes. I don't remember the name of it, but it was helpful back then. This also helps with the kids since they are getting into writing and are always asking me questions, for tips, and this book is filled with tips and answers questions about writing.

"There's not a lot that can be said about a bath mat set, but here goes...My wife and I have two sets of memory foam bath mat sets, two in the bathroom and two in half bathroom connected to our master bath. Our kids love using our bathroom to take a shower just because they love stepping on our memory foam bath mats. We paid quite a bit more for our sets. In the fifty dollar range. If you have kids you know you can't spend that kind of money for bath mats for their bathroom unless you want to buy a new set every few years. We just happened to catch these on sell, the brown color only, but it works well with their bathroom. It's themed partially with a beach theme with a couple of monkey accessories. We know, monkeys and beaches don't really mix, but it's shared by a 12 year old girl (beach) and 10 year old boy (monkeys). Anyway, the bath mats are nice-looking. They feel of good quality as well. You know there's a ""but"" coming. But, the ends roll up on them. This shouldn't be that big of a problem except the one in front the sink actually rolls up enough that their bathroom door won't close unless you move the rug or hold your foot on the end of it. My rating of 3 stars is maybe unfair since we did get them for under ten dollars, but seeing that their regular price is at least double that, I think the 3 stars is justified. It's not a bad product by any means and again, quality and looks are both very good. Seems to be a design flaw on the ends though. Would recommend the set if you're just putting them in the kids bathroom or even a guest bathroom.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TYB72JBQE214/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0GMG2C#wasThisHelpful","R1TYB72JBQE214","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my fifth humidifier review here on Amazon and it's maybe the funniest. Not the review, but the situation around using this humidifier. Lets get one thing out of the way, there's no way this humidifier can run for 100 hours on one tank of water. I've used it for 7 straight days/nights and had to refill each day. It will get roughly 24 hours on one full tank of water, running on medium for those 24 hours. It would be an understatement to say I've been frustrated with humidifiers. They're either too frustrating to clean or they don't put out enough mist or they have some kind of fan that blows the mist over my bed while I sleep. Believe it or not, I liked this one and wanted to try it based on the fact that the company has accessories for it. I don't like buying extra parts for anything, but with all my humidifier problems, it's nice to see a company making efforts to fix problem areas in their products.So, what was so funny? I either hook up a new humidifier in our kitchen or bathroom and let it run for a little while before trying it in our bedroom. I filled the tank up on this one, turned the one knob to ""cool"", turned the mist control knob up about halfway and nothing happened. I had just returned a Vornado that misted whenever it decided it wanted to or whenever I pushed it. So I pushed this one. No mist. I left the room and left it running. I go back 10 minutes later and it looks like someone is having a misting convention in our bathroom. There was lots of mist coming out. I immediately turned it off and back on to see if it was going to be one of those frustrating humidifiers that are inconsistent in their misting. It wasn't. The mist started right up. I then, for fun, turned the mist all the way up and I was surprised over how much mist came out.I rated this a 5 star, but it's not without its faults. I agree with everyone who says there isn't any warm mist coming out of the humidifier. I tried it three times, the unit acts like it's switching as it pauses when you turn the knob from cool to warm, but it doesn't feel any different. This doesn't bother me. I couldn't imagine using warm mist. I'm one of those people who sleeps with a ceiling fan on all year, only use one blanket all year, so the cool mist is the only feature I am interested in, but it should be mentioned that I also don't feel warm mist coming out of this humidifier.There's another part that should be mentioned. This humidifier is harder to fill than the others I've reviewed. The tank is awkward if you're used to any other type of humidifier. Filling it is easy and the valve to close it, closes very tight. Maybe it's the orientation of the tank though that causes a few problems. I fill ours in the bathroom. The bathroom is about 20 ft from our bedroom. I drip water taking the tank to the bathroom and back to the bedroom. I've added a hand towel near it to stop this problem. I wouldn't think this humidifier would be easy for say a kid, an elderly person to fill and refill.That's probably enough cons to question why I would rate it 5 stars. It works. The spout the mist comes out of has two spouts. You could send mist to the right of the humidifier and to the left. I personally turn both towards our bed. This is the first humidifier I have tried that sends mist to both my wife and I. She's always complained about me using the humidifier and blocking the mist from her. This one puts out enough mist that it reaches both of us. Cleaning is pretty standard, but they've made one part easier. The plunger that releases the water from the tank has a square plastic housing around it instead of round. This gives me enough room to get a toothbrush in there to clean it instead of trying to come up with a way to clean the smaller round housing on most humidifiers. The tube in the middle that the water goes into to create the mist is also easily accessible and can be cleaned with a dish-type brush or if you're in a bind, stick a washcloth in it and swab it back and forth.While I do use humidifiers to keep the air in our house moist, it's also relaxing for me to feel the cool mist blowing on my face while I sleep. This one does that better than any I've used. It also has a few features others may like. It has a light you can turn on. It's fairly bright too. I could see that being used in a kid's room or baby nursery as a night light. There's also a red light on it for when it runs out of water. Both are nice features that I see customers posting questions about.The best part, at least for my wife, it's the quietest humidifier I've used. You will hear a soft gurgle maybe two to three times an hour and it's only for a few seconds. I also rated an Optimus humidifier a 5 star and still think it is. It's just I believe this one is better overall. Most of these extra features won't be used by me, but my only real concerns are cleaning and how much mist is put out. This one is the best are those two of all the humidifiers I've reviewed. On a side note, I'm now curious about their smaller one that's half the price of this one. If those problems, the weight of the filled tank, the awkwardness of carrying the tank, the no warm mist problem are major problems for you then you might look at that smaller one by this company or check out the Honeywell or Optimus I reviewed. Both of those perform well and have similar strengths to this one they just don't put out as much mist as this one. If you try one of these be sure to give it time to get the mist going on the first use. I was ready to pack it up and ship it back until the mist started coming out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P5O9VJSI81I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G7VNO4K#wasThisHelpful","R1P5O9VJSI81I6","A1S5QVS3YLY6FK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S5QVS3YLY6FK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She eats emotionally because she hates my other cat, and from time to time, suffers random murder attempts from her.To top things off, she is now on a diet because the vet said things are out of hand, which means I have to separate them to feed them. This would be easier if I didn't have to wait for my lovely but fat kitty to Finally eat.Time will tell if she loses weight, but the hunger strike is (maybe) a start?As for the ingredients, the grain free thing is great, and while my vet generally prefers wet food, this one has some pretty decent ingredients.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K126B7R8QK1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0GTKQG#wasThisHelpful","R2K126B7R8QK1I","A35HOUWHAYZZN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35HOUWHAYZZN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Strangely enough, my favorite parts of the book are the various introductions.In school, we often are forced to read these plays, which is already the most abstract and distanced way to connect (or as is often the case, disconnect) from the intent of the writer. They are meant to be seen by performers. Add to this the florid language, and students often feel alienated. By adding prefaces that show how we relate in our modern lives to the beautiful masterpieces of the Greeks, we can change our perspectives and see the universal truths inside.The translations maintain a certain classical quality, still lofty and elegant, while simplifying and paring down wherever possible, trimming the excess and leaving behind mostly bone and sinew. This allows the listener/reader/audience to fill in the blanks and put a modern voice to something hundreds and hundreds of years old.More than ever, in our militarized society, these plays provide a timeless commentary on the brutality of war.

"This book is so sincere and so beautifully written. It's kind of amazing to find something like this in a time of cynicism, but there is so much hope and so many good intentions in each page; it is heartwarming. Aside from all that, this book is credible and relatable. It speaks DIRECTLY to victims of bullying FROM someone who was herself bullied. Her reassurances that things will be ok and that there are ways to overcome and survive these hard years mean so much more for all of the above. It's not coming from a grown-up, from someone generations away, out of touch or unable to understand; it is not by a psychologist or teacher, which while sympathetic, still feels far removed from the problem. It is by a teenager that just came out of it and is now basking in the silver linings she found.Then there's the format! It is very readable and organized, aesthetic and approachable, broken apart in chapters that work for skimming or reading in order, and introduced with rap poetry. It is beautifully-written and impactful, filled with power and triumph, poignant and captivating.This is a revolutionary book in the self-help genre for younger people. I recommend it to ANY kid, not just those being bullied.

"In an age of technology, video/online games, tablets, and tv, it is getting harder to get kids to connect with real life things, which is why toys like these are so important. This is messy, fun, creative, and most importantly, REAL. Kids use their hands to physically create something. They feel the materials and mold them into whatever their imagination decides (though truthfully, the molds have a better outcome, but who cares as long as they're having a good time and using their imaginations?)The only downside is that you will soon have to buy refills, and as of the date I am reviewing this, the item here retails for $21.55 Prime, but the refills are $17.03 (not Prime, but with free shipping). Even worse, this product says it makes up to 20 clings, while the refill says it only makes 10.

"The issue with upgrading an amplifier for your car is much like getting fancy rims. If your car is a piece of garbage, the fanciest of rims are going to do much. The same is true with speakers. The problem with this was that my speakers weren't good enough for this to make much of a difference, so it wasn't really worth paying someone to install this to boost my limited speakers. It would have been a bit silly as well as a waste of money, so I am waiting until I find better speakers or find someone that will do it for cheap.  It's definitely not the sort of thing you install yourself unless you're already versed in modifying your car. Between the warning labels and enough self-awareness to know this isn't my specialty, I can tell you what the mechanic told me:This is a great way to get the most out of your existing speakers, especially if you don't have Bluetooth, which this would provide. The product is sturdy and pretty powerful, but the other side of the coin is that your car battery gets worn down faster if you plan to listen to music with these. In other words, leave the car on if you're using this for any length of time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD6QJ6NS8MUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VV6YOTU#wasThisHelpful","RD6QJ6NS8MUP","A35HOUWHAYZZN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35HOUWHAYZZN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At a little under $2 per label, these are pretty expensive. Having said that, the concept is pretty cool. Write and re-write on the labels with chalk or chalk pens! It works as described, even though the surface feels nothing like chalk board (probably a good thing), but they're not exactly re-usable in the larger sense. The issue is the thinness of the stickers and the adhesive. They only stick so much the first time, and each subsequent time is a little weaker. If they had made them thicker and had some other options for the backing, it would have been better. Then, instead of being a disposable item, it could be more like a gift in itself by being able to be applied in various places.

At the same time, if it were much larger, it would add weight and bulk, and as it currently is designed, this is a pretty good balance between capacity and portability: it is kind of bulky and heavy, but not bad for what it can do.As for how well it cleans, it does a great job! We have two cats, and this thing really extracts a lot from the carpet, from little tiny particles to bigger things like hair. We chose the deep cleaning, which meant we needed 3 hours for the rug to dry. This is not bad; after a professional cleaning, they recommend 6+ hours dry time. We have someone clean the house every other week and the carpets in the bedroom were professionally cleaned 6 months ago, and considering the cats are generally not allowed there, the fact the water came out Very dirty was surprising. There are two settings: deep cleaning and light cleaning. We did the deep cleaning, and it really worked. This thing is great!The assembly and setup was easy, though to clean it up after use, it is a bit of a pain when it comes to dealing with carpet beater. The water? No problem. Same with the thing that holds the dirty stuff.Excellent vacuum, and cheaper than having professionals come and do it. Comparing the costs, this is well worth the expense.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIG4PVSHJBW4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126C9A5K#wasThisHelpful","RIG4PVSHJBW4N","A35HOUWHAYZZN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35HOUWHAYZZN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the Best idea for a gift! Not only does it nurture creativity and a love of books, but children can actually create a Real book of their own! It even has an ""about the author"" section! You can inspire your child to become a writer or research something they love, or to make beautiful artwork and see it made into something ""real"" and official.I recently reviewed another book that was similar: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TLFTTB6?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0This one is about $14 less for the same number of pages, BUT it is slightly smaller in size and is a soft-cover book, whereas this one is a hard-cover one.

Nope.Side note: we kept a decent distance (again, as instructed), and it still had the results you see.

They're just red and not very powerful. As for the giant screen, you will find in the other reviews that this is just an iPad or tablet holder.

"This style of glasses is light on the face, close to the eyes. If nothing else they are good eye protection and give a moist 'microclime' that is important especially if you have dry eyes, wear contacts, or have had eye surgery. I buy these in clear for general shop and hobby work; a light grey tint for outside general work and day driving glasses, as they take down just enough glare, and the very dark greys when I need glare reduction. Bonus is they are rated Z87 safety glasses and will protect from UV. I started buying the light grey 'carded' on hangpeg at a place that sold serious lawn maintenance equipment, and have worn those for about 5 years (replacing every season). It is good to find them for a lot less here. They can get scratched up doing yard and garden so glad to be able to replace them especially for driving glasses.

"To be fair, I bought ScratchNdent. They were well packaged, four came in bubblepack and one came in original box. No instructions. I was at least clued in and bought the power supply at the same time... they do not come with a power supply.It took a bit to get the body separated from the clipon holding ring. No mounting screws but two mounting holes in the holding ring. There is very little clearance. 6-40's didn't fit, 4-40's almost did. I had to carefully use a cone shape grinding bit in my dremel to gently bevel things and get enough screw clearance (drill from side that faces/touches the main puck body).The pucks are metal cased and metal holding/mounting clip, they are very well made. No warping here from a bit of heat. The wires are red and black, have a bit of heat shrink to go between mounting surface and out the half moon on the holding clip, and are joined flat, wires. You can split them from each other as needed You must fasten them to the mounting area or hide them somehow, and fasten them into part 1 of the power supply. There are two rows of holes to accept the wires, total number of pucks it will support, 6. That part has a joined double wire that goes to a plug with clip, that will clip onto a second clip (the mate to the first one, on the 2 prong wall socket type plug in). It has wart-itis, it will take up space. Both of those wires have some yardage, you can wire the top of an installed bookcase flanking an entertainment center and run wiring all the way down and behind to where the other electronics plug in, easily.Quality of materials, I'd give it a 5. No instructions on the website for the manufacturer either (I expected no documentation as it was a scratchNdent repack) so I took a star for that.  Above the average plugNplay install, part of the reason for that missing star. There was some surface scratching to one of the pucks but it didn't matter because of where I installed them, that was not an issue for me. Over all they are very nice looking and classy, much better than the plastic xenon and LED pucks I've installed before.I installed these undercabinent, so cut a piece of plywood to fit on the bottom shelf on top the bottom shelf proper, this gave me plenty to screw into from the bottom and no points sticking through, then I covered it with shelf paper and that part of the install isn't visible.  They have no on-off, I plugged them into a switched outlet. Warm white is okay, it's over a cooking counter surface, they do make daylight white, and that would have been my first choice. Price was very good, I was able to handle the extra work being a veteran of installing puck lights into/onto various things.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPGNB6KJGQSBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LE5J3LW#wasThisHelpful","RPGNB6KJGQSBL","A133IM5LCXOX1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A133IM5LCXOX1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the dark grey version of the lightly grey tinted ones I'm addicted to as driving glasses. These will do the job, if you want dark sunglasses. If you have had eye laser surgery or your eyes dilated by the eye doctor, these are a good choice for wearing afterwards. They curve around to fit fairly closely, yet give you a good range of vision, they are lightweight so they sit well on the face, and they are also Z87 rated safety glasses.

"I liked that the outlet plug and the socket to plug in your light are in line so easier to put your light in without certain issues when trying to assemble some setups. You can plug this in to the top outlet of a two outlet wall unit and still be able to use the bottom one if you don't have a fat plug for the second one. This one rode through a power out with no issues other than I had to reset the present time on it afterwards. It is fairly quiet so far, I will update if it changes. If you are using a power strip, this can stick out on the sides and you may lose a plug to plug it in as the top will cover one outlet, but. I can use pressure once IT is plugged in to plug in my cord, without rocking the prongs of the timer OUT of the socket.

"Gluten allergy--gluten free <check>Vegan--animal free, dairy free, egg free <check>Good Tasting <check>Easy to use <check>GMO free <check>No nuts <check>I switched from Bob Mill's TVP because that is processed with hexanes. This isn't. It has a wee bit of 'fat' that the other doesn't but it doesn't seem to be affecting my cholesterol numbers or weight...I do think it tastes better, gets 'tender' faster (reconstitutes easier) and is a little less off feeling in the mouth (texture) than the TVP. I measure it with a 1/8 cup stainless coffee scoop, and consider 2 heaping scoops a daily serving of protein. Heat 1/4 cup of water to boiling, add a teaspoon of your boullion if you want to flavor it (1/2 to 1 teaspoon) then after that dissolves put in the TSP and let soak for a few minutes. Or add right into your soup or stew at the end of cooking. These are about twice the price of TVP but I think they are much better for me, and a 4 pack runs about two months at that size serving for one. The individual bags are a bit bigger than a similar bag of TVP as well. One will fit nicely poured into a 1/2 gallon sealed container.  Subscribe and it is cheaper, I like that. The hard part is to figure out how much and how often to set up your subscription for.They have also made good pizza toppings and taco and burrito filler. For pizza I will reconstitute and sprinkle across the pizza right after the sauce and before other toppings, so it's in there being a 'meat' layer. I have not found a binder that will keep it in burger or meatball form that I can eat (the binder) so I treat this as a loose ground meat fake. It will be a very light colored loose ground meat fake, is a drawback if you are really trying to fake 'meat'.

When your order arrives Tech Armor sends you an email link to a youtube video on how to install their product, as they want you to be totally happy and do the install right. (our phones were delayed in arrival so had product before phones) I took the protectors in and during setup, installed them--before anyone touched the screens. The phones come with a cling wrap that totally goes around it, I peeled this after a hand washing and followed the directions, using the wipe and the little cloth then floating the glass from the top down as it showed. It literally melted on. The November one after the X made with finger literally melted into place, no funny spots or bubbles. The January one took a little more convincing but my thumbs easily shoved the slight bubbleation totally off. Afterwards they looked factory installed or the phones came that way. There are two versions offered, a PET plastic and a Ballistic Glass, I always prefer hardened glass, and saying that, they look great. There is an edge there that can catch glurp so be very careful if you have to clean along there. I have a feeling the protector will last for the life of the contract without any problems. No issues with tactile transfer either, it 'listens and obeys' when I touch the screen. If you do a search the cheaper one is the PET plastic, the more expensive is the glass. Go glass.It comes with a small microfiber cloth, a squeegee plastic tool, a packet with a sealed cleaning towelette that's premoistened, a pamphlet with how to do this, and the protector in a sleeve with a peeltab for you to get the adhesive covering plastic off. And Tech Armor sent me the email with the video link twice, once each purchase (got email through Amazon) so that you can view the install video. Totally happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZ1263KTZAG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGMVD8W#wasThisHelpful","R2YZ1263KTZAG6","A133IM5LCXOX1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A133IM5LCXOX1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent. Hardened tip that grips. I got stuck using this in a space on a #2 as this was the only thing I had that fit.

"Was referred to as an alternate for a Defender Ottercase, as the latter has an issue with the screen protector window sitting above the screen surface. This one does require you to add a screen protector, I paired it with the Tech Armor HD ballistic glass. It is NOT waterproof. It CAN stand being dumped a few times in a row onto the paved parking lot just fine. It is good to grip, I have long fingers so the 6 plus is not too hard to hold, and this case is easy to hang onto. It feels solid, it is lightweight for what it is. I feel like I have a comfortable secure grip hanging onto it. It is not difficult to remove either (so I can use my backplate-attach tele/micro lens set) for dedicated camera work. Only drawback is the little easel leg, but just making sure it is in the right place when installing the phone and it sits and folds/unfolds correctly. Enough to mention, not enough to drop a star for. The combo of protector and this case came to about half of the Ottercase as well, so I am very happy with the purchase. I only wish there was an option for a safety orange or bright lime green or hot pink color, as I like high visibility cases. The blue is sleek though, and nice enough finish off for more elegant settings. I did get a waterproof bag type protector for if I think I'm going to be in wetness, to slide this into, it fits well in that. It is not a belt holster type case... but it does have the included easel standup leg for setting on tabletop or desk. Controls and ports are get-to-able, even the home button. A definite recommend.Update, we recently got another phone in family, and purchased the Spigen 110xx case for that one, this is the 109xx... the last two digits are a color. This one has more angular contours, the 110 is more rounded. The small handed person likes the angles on the 109 better, it gives more to grip. The 110 for the person with the large hands feels more comfortable, they have plenty of grip as well. Both make the phones feel more substantial and sturdy without being HEAVY. Both cases went on similarly and both were very easy to put on. Do follow the instructions, peel the black rubbery part out, put that on the phone first, then make sure the easel leg is in place then snap the hard part on, side to side. With the Space Grey, the black front with the black rubbery edge looks sleek. With the Silver or Gold, the black rubbery edge puts the white face trim into high contrast. Either looks good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K7N9VEDWMD7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLG8CLQ#wasThisHelpful","R1K7N9VEDWMD7O","A133IM5LCXOX1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A133IM5LCXOX1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well made and grips the slots well. I am happy I added this to my toolbox.  I can also get some good torque going, the handle though slim is surprisingly good to grip. Well made tool.

"Thank you for delivering me. I am gluten intolerant and massively miss BREAD. I've already tried one of these recipes and I love how the master recipes can be adapted for other ways of cooking/baking and quantity also. I will be dedicating much time in the near future to exploring this!Gluten free tends to go stale quickly, but the fact I can bake up a small amount and be able to consume it in a meal or two is wonderful.Thank you, I was a bread-aholic and that has been one of the worst bits about the diet change. If you are in the same circumstances, get this book. I'm not regretting my buying it after just one day/recipe.  I will update as I work on the recipes in here.*edit* I see I'm getting dinged as this isn't helpful?????C'mon. Bread and pasta withdrawal when I hit having to go gluten-free has been no fun at all.Others say the pictures are B&W? So, at least there's pictures. Some of my mother's and grandmother's cookbooks had NO pictures. And some of the older ones I collect, they don't even tell you precisely how to make something. They EXPECT you to be well versed then just follow a few sentences or a paragraph of description and make it turn out (my best hollandaise recipe came from a reprint 1904 Gold Medal Flour cookbook and after a few trials and errors; I now can make that (and now it's for others)superbly) This book doesn't expect you to have to do that; they tell you how.I like rather than having to buy expensive mixes in a box; I can mix up some DIY mix, then dip into that and make it into bread when I want to. Yes you have to do the prep of mixing up your own mix; and store that. After that, this is the great way to make bread again. I've had many doughy fake-o gritty as if the litterbox got dumped in there fiasco hockeypuck bricks that yield coasters instead of real slices of b-r-e-a-d. This has been allowing me to get something that actually looks like bread, smells like bread, tastes like bread, and has texture I expect. I can even feed it to my spouse without complaints, who can have gluten.This has been a wonderful addition to my growing shelf of cookbooks as I deal with no gluten, no salt, no cholesterol and diabetic. This DOES mean I have to actually go back to say the era when I learned to cook and actually COOK every day. At least this cookbook is allowing me to once more have bread. Without having to be a chef level cook. Without having to have cooked for a good 40 years already.This has been worth my money. It's still 5 stars plus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QOGSGFKHW2JO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250018315#wasThisHelpful","R2QOGSGFKHW2JO","A133IM5LCXOX1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A133IM5LCXOX1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I developed gluten allergy, and it is amazing how little it takes to cause a reaction. Trust me this is no fun. I WAS buying my TVP from a health food store that had on the bags a warning about non-dedicated facility, so they couldn't guarantee no cross contamination. Batches/bags from them was a crapshoot and you'd run across a 'cursed' batch more often than not. This brand is made in a dedicated facility, no chance of cross contamination. If you are gluten-intolerant this is VERY IMPORTANT.These are store retail bags, packaged in their shelf/display box; one box holds 4 bags. I liked the extra security the box gave the product during shipment.The quality is very good, it readily rehydrates, good texture and mouth feel; and even better, no tossing the proverbial coin about being 'cursed' after eating. It is very much worth buying my protein this way; I count on TVP to make my gluten free foods better; and add the protein I need. TVP rehydrated with boullion, will take on that flavor (go 2x amount of boullion) and makes a wonderful pizza topping!  I also find it good to add a few spoonfuls to soup to thicken the broth and replace the need for crackers; and again, add the protein. This has about three times the protein of lean meat, and no cholesterol. You do have to count it as a carb though.TVP is like mushrooms, it will very readily pick up a flavor. This can work to your advantage in many ways.If you have to turn to TVP as part of your diet, this is a good product to depend on and a good way to buy it in bulk. Further handiness is the display box is a good way to store the bags in your pantry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JXCKC02WAGRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YR97J2#wasThisHelpful","R2JXCKC02WAGRW","A133IM5LCXOX1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A133IM5LCXOX1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this through Amazon Warehouse scratchNdent so it is not a true reflection on the regular seller, who is downunder-us.Another friend purchased two of these spring of 2013 and uses them in a 7x11' greenhouse attached to his garage to make his orchids bloom. It does give off mostly red light, which encourages plants to bloom; and uses it in the hour after sunrise and hour before sunset to supplement the natural light. I will say it works well for him. I am building a walipini greenhouse, screen growing house (frame with shadecloth) and a rearing area so I can do intermittent mist and various other ways of starting and bringing my plants from seed, cutting, or graft into a full marketsized plant...for my own use (two acres means I need a lot of plants year round!) I will update this review as I work with this light in my setup.The unit is about the size of a Frisbee but the depth of a pet food dish, and weighs a few solid pounds. The casing is powdercoat metal, a nice solid feel to it. Attached to the back by clips is a trio of coated woven fiber (thin, reminds me of picture framing stuff) attached to a hang hook, it drops about a foot. Attached to that is a moderate length (about 6') black rubberized round cord with 3 prong plug.  The unit has 'plugged in-it's on' to 'unplug-it's off'. It would be easy to plug it into a timer to be switched on and off. There are three small fans and three outlet grilles in the top. LED's can run very warm, so it doesn't surprise me about the venting. It will be very important to keep direct drip/condensation drip off this unit, out of afternoon sun if in use; and keep the top and sides of unit clear to allow good air circulation. I would not suggest hanging from the top part of a greenhouse shell where the heat gathers.I have a light meter coming any time now, I want to test light output. Friend says he has it at 3-4' above the top of his orchids, and two cover his 7x11' space with enough useable output for the plants. The lumens will drop off some over time but being LED should last several years still putting out at least 70% by the end. Most of the LED's are putting out reds, threre are a few blues, which are 'growth' spectrum. Red encouraged blooming. If you are starting and growing seedlings you want blue end (cool white at minimum; or a majority blue-LED light, not a mostly red-LED like this)The condition of the item was accurately described; it had a scratch across the LED protective lens and the metal case; in the back it had a dent into one of the vent fan areas on the grille. It was wrapped well in bubble wrap, no other packaging. The scratching in front is cosmetic; the back I was able to use a thin flat bladed screw driver and bend the grill out to a satisfactory 'flat' to allow the fan behind it to run properly. It does come on when plugged in; and not something you a person wants to look at for long times. I will suggest using UV blocking sunglasses or safety glasses if you have to work around it while on.I am sure that the retailer does provide quality product, this WAS through Amazon Warehouse Deals and was an 'as is' item that was damaged so it was discounted. I have bought many things through Amazon Warehouse Deals and this was about the 'worst' I have encountered so far; but the condition was pretty accurately described so I bought informed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27F9BS633XCPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FOVNZM#wasThisHelpful","R27F9BS633XCPM","A133IM5LCXOX1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A133IM5LCXOX1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For other publications, and other merchandise that this person was selling. Then they get 22 pages of poorly written and a few bad illustrations... for their money.Some of the 5 stars look like friend and family glowing reviews added to try to push the rating of this UP so people will buy it.

"I miss my trackwheel.This mouse is LARGE. My hands are small with long fingers and it does fit my hand fairly well. You do NOT have to move the mouse, it sits still on the desktop, you use the ball and the buttons to move stuff about to do what you need to.The red ball stays in if you turn the mouse upside down. No missing ball.It is very responsive, and very precise. If you are scrolling up and down through pages of text, you have to do it by rolling the ball and trackwheel is much faster. If you are doing graphics editing, it is very nimble to roll about (this is what I got it for).I have hand and finger nerve damage, this did help spread some of the stress on my fingers, thumb, and wrist around, which is another plus. I gave it four stars only because I was a trackwheel addict; and at times I can lose the cursor on screen and have to do some frantic roll-back-and-forth to see where the cursor got to again.I do like that I no longer need the full mousepad space, just getting it situated though where it can stay put can be more difficult sometimes. I can also push it into the edge of my laptop sometimes by accident and depress a side key which can cause problems.I consider it a specialized mouse, for graphics crunching, editing and some gaming it may be perfect. I am happy with it and it is mostly doing everything it should and what I need. Your first finger still moves a lot but it's no longer doing the clicking (I use first and second fingers to roll the ball), the thumb does most of the clicking, ring finger or little finger usually gets to do the rightclick...it does take the stressing mostly off your wrist.I thought the secondary buttons would be more of a problem but I rarely have that issue. They are programmable for mostly gaming purposes....I have not tried that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36GDGPVFQHABU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F42MKG#wasThisHelpful","R36GDGPVFQHABU","A133IM5LCXOX1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A133IM5LCXOX1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had to go gluten-free. I also have other dietary constraints and having that one heaped on top really made it horrid... no COMFORT FOOD.  Going through several brands of non-wheat pasta, including rice only, quinoa and/or amaranth based, and a couple of corn and rice based; Barilla does it right.Product LOOKS right. It has a fair shade of yellow that does look like durum-wheat based pasta.Cooking... it doesn't want to stick to the bottom of the pot right away and keep sticking; it doesn't toss up a sort of sticky film in the middle of the pot on the water; and the water doesn't turn into a sort of gelatinous glue. When you drain this you drain 'water' off. It also cooks in about the same amount of time as the Barilla wheat-pasta.Texture. It feels like, yes it chews like, wheat-pasta.Only downside is do NOT overcook, drain it right away. It does sometimes give you a hint of a taste of 'canned corn' but it is not bad at all. The rice-only stuff is very pale, sticks onto the pot while cooking and doesn't chew right. Quinoa and/or amaranth is the really gluey stuff (often has corn in it too) and chews 'gritty' (leftover in fridge for a few hours does get a little less gritty feeling).Out of all the 'fake food' I have had to learn to like; this is a very good substitute. It is made in dedicated gluten free space with dedicated machinery, aka no cross-contamination. I can at least have my pasta, my comfort food; just have to watch the carbs. My spouse who doesn't have the diet restrictions tried this and gave it five tines up too, this one tastes good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REYZWHJK4ERHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRA8HSM#wasThisHelpful","REYZWHJK4ERHS","A133IM5LCXOX1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A133IM5LCXOX1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was originally a proprietary private press book sold with a dog training system and franchising. In 2000 we adopted a puppy and the neighbor across the street had set up to give training lessons with this system... we liked it because it is all positive feedback and our dog turned into a well mannered all around good doggie citizen. (Keeshond, can be a little stubborn... :) )We lost the papers the trainer had given us; and it was wonderful we were able to find this book off the secondary market. Franchises originally sold for $15,000 I'm told; so this is indeed a deal to get off the used market. The method takes some patience, and investment in time with your dog, but it most certainly WORKS.As the other reviewers have commented, the 'silly little rectangle' was indeed very silly, but. It Works.We had a good dog, that sat at doorways, didn't immediately bolt for freedom the split second she seen an open gate or door. Some breeds are more likely to want to do that; bolt at any chance; but. I can't say enough good things.

"This is one of the smaller colocasias, and it is lovely, but. It is a little more delicate and gorgeous, well worth the effort.I killed my first one so I went back and got three more; and gave each one a little different environment trying to get something to survive.It is a 'wet toes'. I put it in a deep 8"" recycled nursery pot, and it sits in a catchpan about 3"" deep and a few inches larger in diameter, and I keep about 1"" of water in the bottom of the catchpan. It can mostly then have roots out of the soggy zone but it has all the water it wants then.This is a temperature loving colo, in that it really hates seeing night temperatures near or below 50f. 70 or so is more to it's liking. It likes lots of filtered sun, I had put it under 60% shadecloth outside when the weather permitted and it grew well.The leaves, mine topped out at about 8"" long, and the plant in pot is about 3-4.5' tall, closer to 3'. When perfectly happy I had 7-8 leaves, most of the time it's around 5-6, and the life expectancy of a leaf isn't as much as some other colos.  The one I grew in the house did fairly well, kept leaves more at 4-5"" and a few feet tall in a 6"" pot. I would suggest an 8"". I also found it likes to 'eat' and suggest a mild kelp based fertilizer, a few cups properly mixed weekly. It is a beautiful plant; well worth it, but. It seemed to like low 70s for the night and no more than mid 90's for the day, and lots of light but filtered and it needs wind protection. It did okay as a houseplant. If your night temps are dipping towards 50, it needs to come in, if you get anything below 50f, it will not like it.If you want a big showy colocasia look at a Thai Giant. This is not a BIG plant. It is beautiful, to me, worth the bit of extra effort. If you want one make sure that you order during the season you are not having freezing temperatures; if it gets too cold in shipping it will die. When you get it unpack it and repot into a larger pot immediately, good soilless mix, put in a warm place with bright but not direct light for several hours a day and bottom water it. As long as the growing shoot is not badly damaged (the leaves form along the last leaf's stalk then separate and unfurl) it should come around.Update 2/5/14, adding a picture taken about a week ago, of a mojito leaf in my greenhouse. From tip of finger to wrist bend wrinkle my hand is 7"" long, for comparison. The pot is sitting in about 1.5"" of water with 3.5"" out.

"Roses lack a particular color gene period, they can not produce blue. I am a 'bit busting pixel jockey' aka my job is to fix digital photography into looking good. This picture has been obviously retinted, probably a white to begin with.Most 'blues' are a lavender rose... they geneticially inserted a blue producing gene and did some other stuff to a rose type and got another lavender they are touting as 'blue' , the ""Applause"". They could not succeed in totally turning off a red producing gene and there is a compatibility issue with the blue (pansy) gene they inserted so it is still a lavender rose. The florist supplied 'blues' are either food dye tinted (white buds put in strongly blue dyed water) or airbrushed or spraypainted to give a blue tipped blush.Roses are very hard to grow from seed, and unless the pollination was totally controlled (bagged blooms and hand pollenating) you have no idea what the genes are in the seed proper. IF you know what you're doing, and it is a long process of cold dormancy and scarification then some pretty precise germination conditions; you can get maybe 20% germ. Maybe. One in five chance. Maybe.  And that is if the seed was handled properly from harvest onwards. Expect especially with 5 seeds you're going to get a zero return.Save your money and your headache. Roses are best propagated as cane divisions, budding to rootstock, or air layered to produce own root based plants.  Something this rarified would probably have to be put to rootstock and probably have a high failure rate... then like Sterling Silver, a real careful 3-5 years to get it established enough to survive.

"After a shocking incident many years ago, I insist on 'solid' taps if I have to use a splitter.  With my ponding, watergardening, aquarium work, greenhouse, and plant work it seemed that it took a minimum of two 3way ganged together to get enough taps for that set of lights, water and air pumps, etc. And they always wanted to come apart, in the middle.This is a little overkill but... it doesn't come apart between. You can lock the incoming cord in (I can lock a 12/3 in easy) and if you need to you can lock ONE outgoing cord. Else it gives you five taps and there's no issue of 2 3's deciding to part enough to be a hazard in the middle. It's overall more water resistant than a power strip, and with the extension feeding this on a GFCI circuit, I can be safe in my work. It is a bit heavy, even before you plug things into it, but I am very happy with this purchase.I do NOT recommend running several power tools off this at once; anything with a serious amp draw should have it's own adequately rated single line.

"This originally started as dog training franchises and were on the order of $15,000.... this is the self published book that outlined the method of no punishment/no harm dog training. A neighbor had gotten into a franchise and we had gotten a keeshond; they can be a bit on the bratty and stubborn side. We liked the lesson system as it didn't make the dog fearful; but an obedient and well mannered doggyperson who was a good dog and part of our family. We lost the lesson material we were given as part of the training several years ago; the dog has passed on, and we wanted to get another dog... and train the new one the same way. Trust me, getting this book off the used market was a great find!Having a dog that would sit on command even when there was someone at the door, didn't bolt through an open door or gate at any opportunity, and was boundary trained; was well worth it. I will say though that with any dog training method, sometimes the owner and family also need to be trained... and have to stay consistent!  Still this is the best training method I've found and the results were well worth the hunt to get a copy of this book.

"These are a tropical plant. Colocasia like 'wet toes' and are 'voracious eaters'.  The picture with the fellow standing in it is possible, but I will say mine is potted and is more like 2-3' plus long leaves, held vertically, a few splay over.  I have seen ones that big with lots of compost and in a gulf/tropical climate (over about a 10a).The blooms as shown are about 4"" long, don't really smell much, and last a few days then flop and take about a week to being ready to harvest.  The one I got I started from a softball sized corm; it is currently in a 16"" pot and stands about 7' high. It keeps 4-5 leaves at all times and the leaves last for some months. It has put on a side shoot that's about 2' tall and I need to divide it. It also bloomed and I harvested the berries after the bloom fell over; squished to pip out 1-2 seeds each and immediately planted them into moist soilless mix then covered them for humidity. They sprouted, I got 13 of 17... and are currently in 6"" pots and 8-12"" high. (the pulp and that are somewhat toxic, make sure pets and kids can't get into either)Colos like it wet usually, though I found the established plant doesn't want to stand in water. I water by putting 2"" in the catch saucer every 3 days or so and a cup or so dumped on top the soil, it then sucks up the water happily. I fertilize every third time with two cups of humic soluable fertilizer mix, mixed up and shook before measuring.  I have seen pictures of leaves fully 6 1/2' long and 5' wide, they planted it directly in a finished compost pile. Mine spent the summer in a shade cloth growing house outside with night getting down to 50-65 and day going 85-100 under 60% shade, and loved it. It got some wind but it was mostly sheltered and the screen house helped diffuse the wind as well. It is now in greenhouse space for the winter-spouse is allergic-no houseplants allowed any more.These plants will briefly and infrequently tolerate upper 40's but by then I moved it inside.  Can get these little black aphidy looking things about flyspeck size, easily cleaned by hand (yes, mush with your fingers or take a damp paper towel and wipe the stems off). Holes or breaks/damage to the leaves can draw mealybugs right at the damage spot!  Because of the temperature, I wouldn't order this until you are seeing your night-times in the upper 40's to low 50's pretty reliably and when you start seeing cold spiking into 40s at night in the fall, again don't order.I consider this a very fair weather plant; instead of letting it go dormant I am keeping it as a year round plant; and it does have an issue of SIZE. Other than that I have had much fussier houseplants. After one year I now have them coming out of my... and the coming year definitely plan to add them to my landscape in shady wind protected places (we have issues with heat, low humidity, brutal sun, and lots of wind) and will continue to grow them as a cool plant. The leaves are BIG, distinctive, held mostly upright and make a great statement. Compared to my other Taro, this has the biggest flattest leaves, and the sturdiest stalks.When you get one of these, they should be immediately potted up into a 6"" or 8"" pot and held in bright light and at least 70f if you can manage it (at night too) for a few weeks (no direct sun unless within 3 hours of sundown), don't let it get over about 85f; and let it recover from shipping. Bottom water every few days; if you get tips of the oldest leaves going brown/dead/crispy it's too dry!  Aim for nicely moist without soggy.  Then if you're putting it outside start hardening it off for a few weeks. Suggest a shady spot with wind protection and good drainage. As it gets bigger each new leaf will get larger than the last, and it quickly goes to looking like the picture!I love Thai Giant, it looks so tropical and lovely, it's worth the bit of extra work to me.2/5/14 adding a slightly blurred but good picture of relative size of my winter leaves. Plant is in 14"" pot and stands over my head in pot; always has 4-5 leaves flat and out; and it has a baby about 2' tall that needs to be divided off. The seeds, I got 13/17 to germ and lost a few along the way, all the babies are in 6"" pots and some are making a foot tall now and biggest leaf is about 3-4' long (8 made it to quarter size leaves and strongly 4"" tall), in 5 months.

"Rarely does a woodworker need or go through a gallon of wood glue with a project or two. It may seem cheap to buy a gallon but if you don't use it before it goes south; it's a waste.This may be a little small for some projects but it is a good sized bottle. And I have when planning to go on a major binge of work; bought a gallon and refilled this size container as needed.It will get 'crusted over' with time and need replacing now and  again, but I can easily pour three gallons through one of these before I decide on 'replace the squeezy bottle'.That being said, Titebond II is a glue I turn to for a lot of things. I have used it for craft as well as wood; especially in making padded upholstered display panels. (smear onto plywood, lay 1/2 to 1"" closed cell foam over it, put another piece of luan and a few carefully spaced concrete blocks to dry overnight...) It will adhere the foam to the backer board, to then be covered. I have also glued upholstery fabrics to the top of said foam with it, leave about 4"" unglued of the foam around the edge, then tuck fabric into place, glue, recover and reweight for the night; and it will turn out well. Test bleed, it can bleed through and make stiff.I go though a lot of Titebond II, the other is the polyurethane 'foaming' glues that are water activated. This is a good size unless you are after a large project, in which case buy a larger jug and use one of this size as a handleable 'field squeeze' bottle.

The basket is a little funky but a set of cheap metal tongs they make for serving buffet food work well, just rinse them off good after dipping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13GRPQSAH3E4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018IIPFK#wasThisHelpful","R13GRPQSAH3E4J","A133IM5LCXOX1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A133IM5LCXOX1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It covers where others have successfully grown this sort of stuff, and what you have to do to replicate their success. This is one of the few where the 'look inside' feature gave me enough to make me comfortable in ordering this book.  If you are in grow zones 4-7, you can grow some stuff that is normally say 8 or warmer... not guaranteeing your results, but if you are truly looking to push a few boundaries and grow what you always wanted to, this may indeed help (I grew up in 2a, it's now up to 3a there; and moved southwards and gained altitude the last few moves. We were recently classified as 6b, up a half... and I am within 2 hours drive of full grown palm trees and magnolias, grown with an eye to sheltering and microclime...if they can, *I* can). The idea of growing a palm or palms is definitely something I wish to do; I am currently into Taro (Elephant Ears, Alocasia and Colocasia)... and learned the hard way that a Gunneria will NOT grow here, temperatures go too high in our summer and our sun and wind are just too brutal...(such a cool looking plant too, and they will not survive the winters) ... This is a very good book for pushing your warmer climate plants and making them happy out of their 'normal zone'. I do rate this as not for the totally inexperienced beginner gardener; you should be comfortable with being able to do some garden construction (cold frames, windbreaks, shade cloth), mulching, pest control, compost, and investing some TIME and EFFORT to get what you want. I am a competition grower in a microclime pocket/niche zone; so this book fits right in with what I'm already familiar with... I do heartily recommend this book for the $, if this is what interests you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WSXD69JI42P6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604693290#wasThisHelpful","R1WSXD69JI42P6","A133IM5LCXOX1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A133IM5LCXOX1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We had a past dead sliding screen panel for our patio door.... and with sleuthing it was figured out that the door itself was an Anderson. From them this part (2 in package) was like $40!!!!!  It arrived very promptly, was installed within an hour, and bliss! The door works excellently once again. This seems to be a perfect replacement, it looked identical to the old ones.  No more being locked in or out of house because the old assembly had locked up and the only option was to unship the whole screen from the track to get in or out then replace it. Strongly considering getting another package for the eventuality this one wears out, but.

"It was recommended to me a few years ago by a serious website on various bog and carnivorous plants. I asked them for a good book as I had had fair to poor luck over years (including setting up peat bog terrariums that were watered with distilled water....) and managed to keep something alive for about 8 months.  I finally bought the book and it was well worth it. If you truly want to keep pitchers, sundews and trap plants; this is a good reference.

"It doesn't like anything in the water to speak of, and the float is...unresponsive. I hook/hang the float in a vertical position when I want to pump water with it.  I got it for moving water when doing pond maintenance (not muck pumping either) and if I had a friend that had one to tell me what they're like I would not have bought this one. I am not buying another one.  I rate it as 'okay' because it does run and water does flow. I don't think I'd count on it in a critical situation (such as a sump)(update 3-30-2014)It is still working; if the water is close to freezing the float cable tends to be stiff and stays that way, it doesn't bend.  I installed it in a 1000 gallon 'water seasoning' tub that is about 4.5' deep when full; in my backyard... and use it to fill/top ponds and tubs as needed. I had to dig through my tote tub of fittings and came up with one for adapting to garden hose. It 'hangs' on the top lip of the tub until needed, then I drop it to the bottom of the tub, plug it in, and the float has a catch cord I added that I can clip to the top lip to keep it 'up'. I also know almost to the minute how long it takes to pump the tank to certain points and will set a timer to remind me to go check it before it hits 'bottom' so I don't run the pump dry.It has lasted far longer than I expected. It pushes water fairly well, I have only asked it to deal with 4-5' of head and it does well with that. I only use it with the 'clean' water, it does not like ANYTHING in it's water; it is no where near a dirty water pump. I've cleaned out the bottom intake and impeller stuff twice, not as much wear as I expected.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FP9JBWY8P24V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IJR5GK#wasThisHelpful","R2FP9JBWY8P24V","A133IM5LCXOX1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A133IM5LCXOX1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've been talking about buying a safe ever since we moved into our home in 2008.  Everyone needs a place to store important documents (tax forms, social security cards, mortgage information, passports, birth certificates) where they're safe in case of emergencies.  Unfortunately, that was six years ago and like many people, we still hadn't bought a safe.  Enter the SentrySafe SFW205CWB Water Proof Combination Safe, 2X-Large.  Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Ample amount of storage room.  2 cubic feet per the description.+ Provides you with peace of mind knowing that your documents and valuables are secure.+ Varying degrees of internal temperature protection depending on the contents.+ Sturdy construction.+ Can be bolted to the floor.+ Water resistant.Cons- Heavy (that's a good thing) but this makes moving it a 2 person job.- No emergency key lock in case you lose or forget the combination.- Desiccants and periodic airing out of safe is required.- Items can still melt (photos and such) inside if the temperature gets too high.- Dial lock is plastic and feels cheap.We were happy to welcome the SentrySafe SFW205CWB Water Proof Combination Safe, 2X-Large into our home, especially since we had no safe prior.  It has provided us with a secure place to store our valuable documents and belongings as well as setting your mind at ease against threats such as burglars, fire and storm damage.  That being said, the safe isn't exactly perfect.  I don't like not having a back up way of opening the safe in case you misplace or forget the combinations (remedied if you register the safe with SentrySafe).  The safe also won't be able to protect all of your valuables from heat damage.  Finally, like other reviewers have stated, the dial combination is plastic and I'm concerned that it wouldn't survive a fire.  All in all I feel the SentrySafe SFW205CWB Water Proof Combination Safe, 2X-Large  would be a solid investment for those looking to protect their personal valuables from unfortunate circumstances.  I know our home is happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25BQYW2QHV71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HS3NI4W#wasThisHelpful","R25BQYW2QHV71","A3DH53FPYSP9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DH53FPYSP9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We spend a lot of time in the kitchen around our house trying different recipes and foods, so we tend to use a lot of different cooking gadgets.  When you find a good one it becomes invaluable.  As we've gotten older eating and drinking healthier has definitely become more of a concern.  Enter the ""Big Boss 9358 Multi-Speed Stainless Steel Power Juicer, 800-watt.""  Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Rubber grip feet at the bottom help keep the unit stable while juicing.+ Easy way to produce juices and other healthy foods.+ Powerful 800 watt motor makes processing even the toughest foods nearly effortless.+ Instruction manual, although basic is helpful for beginners.+ Effectively removes seeds and other non-edibles.+ Pitcher makes collecting and pouring the juice simple.+ Stainless steel casing.+ 3 year limited warranty.Cons- Plastic parts (all accessories and knob) feel rather flimsy.  I worry about their durability and longevity.- Removable pieces are technically not dishwasher safe and are rather time consuming to clean by hand. The blades/screen may take a bit longer to remove any lodged fibers.- Small pieces of food can still fly out of the pulp bin even when it's properly attached.- Cost of fresh fruit and vegetables for juicing tends to get expensive.- Lackluster instruction booklet.At the end of the day the Big Boss 9358 Multi-Speed Stainless Steel Power Juicer, 800-watt is an effective juicer for the money.  We had no difficulties juicing any of the fruits and vegetables we tried, even the more fibrous ones.  We primarily use it for apple and orange juice often with a bit of cucumber.  If the food costs weren't so expensive we'd probably use it more often.  Clean up is another reason it doesn't get more regular use around our household.  We just find the multiple parts a pain to rinse and clean.  The price of this unit also seems to fluctuate quite a bit.  I've seen it anywhere from $99 (a great deal) to its full list price of $199 (a bit too much).  This is one of those items I'm sure many would love to receive it as a gift and would gladly put it on a wedding registry.  If you're looking to eat/drink more healthy the Big Boss 9358 Multi-Speed Stainless Steel Power Juicer, 800-watt is a nice place to start as it definitely does what it's supposed to.

"My dog is a 65lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially from food. He can also be a bit of a picky eater so finding the right mix can often be difficult. While he loves just about any treat, but I always have reservations about trying new food. Unfortunately, a large majority of popular dog foods today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new food so here are my thoughts on Nutrience Natural Healthy Adult Dog Food, 18-Pounds, Seven Fish Medley;Pros+ A nice healthy variety of fish, vegetables, fruit and supplements.+ All ingredients are made in North America (U.S.A. and Canada) which gives me a bit more piece of mind than foods containing ingredients from China.+ Easy to open re-sealable bag with a Velcro strip at the top to help keep food fresh longer.+ Dog loved it and gobbled it up quickly with no fuss.+ No corn, wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.+ A plethora of healthy and helpful ingredients such as Omega 3 & 6, antioxidants, vitamin C & E, glucosamine and chondroitin.+ My dog had no digestive issues after eating this.Cons- Kibble may be a bit too large for smaller or older dogs.- Velcro reseal on the bag isn't air-tight but it's obviously better than no seal at all.- Limited availability in brick and mortar stores.  As far as I can tell it's sold in Canada and online only at the moment.- Expensive for an 18-pound bag.  If you have larger or multiple dogs the price will get a bit hefty.- Strong fish smell, good for the enticing the dog but not so pleasant wherever you're storing the food.- Not Grain Free.My dog really enjoyed Nutrience Natural Healthy Adult Dog Food, 18-Pounds, Seven Fish Medley.  He was of course extremely excited when I approached with the bag (as he is with every new food) and quickly at the half cup I mixed into his bowl.  His current food is Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Dogs, Large Breed 60+ Chicken Formula, 40 Pound Bag which he enjoys, but after introducing him to Nutrience he seems to prefer it over the Diamond brand.  Currently I'm still mixing the two foods until both are gone at which point I'll most likely switch completely to Nutrience Grain Free Dog Food, 18-Pound, Ocean Fish.  Although the price is a bit high to purchase on a regular basis, I feel the savings will outweigh the cost of unnecessary veterinary visits due to allergies and infections caused by questionable ingredients in other foods.  If you're willing to pay a little extra for your dog's food in hopes of keeping them happy and healthy, then you may want to give Nutrience Natural Healthy Adult Dog Food, 18-Pounds, Seven Fish Medley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WLPANK4IXQ73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDZT3OI#wasThisHelpful","R1WLPANK4IXQ73","A3DH53FPYSP9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DH53FPYSP9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a DJ and avid gamer I'm always in the market for new and decent quality headphones. I've owned and used many headsets over the years (three Turtle Beach) and there always seems to be something new for PC, gaming consoles, mobile devices and DJing.  As I always enjoy testing out new headphones here are my thoughts on the Turtle Beach Titanfall Ear Force Atlas Official Xbox One Xbox 360 PC Gaming Headset;Pros+ Simple to plug on the X1 (adapter was immediately identified and was asked to update the controller, very simple process, took less than 2 minutes to update the controller).+ Nice sound, crisp treble, solid bass with nothing being too overwhelming.+ Includes Xbox One Audio Adapter ($25 individually).+ Multi-platform use (X1, Xbox 360 and other mobile devices.  They even work with my PS4 and PS Vita).+ Microfiber ear cups are comfortably padded, even for those of us who wear glasses.+ Sleek looking Titanfall decal design.+ Separate game and chat audio control options.+ Fantastic noise isolation.+ Lengthy main USB cord.+ Detachable mic.+ Officially licensed.+ Lightweight.Cons- Sounds better on the PC than on the X1.  I've noticed it doesn't seem to get as loud on the X1.- Headband tends to be a bit too tight after a while which is odd considering I have a smaller head than most.  It was not very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  This would be problematic for someone with a larger head.- Crackling sound and sometimes microphone pop noise on the X1. (UPDATE - most recent X1 Update fixed these issues).- Control remote on the cable is a bit larger than it needs to be.  It's always falling off of my computer tower at the slightest pull even.- Amplifier not compatible with the X1.- Can be hard to plug the cable into the amplifier because of the rubber casing, had to make sure it was properly inserted, since it sounded like s*** before I rechecked the connection. It makes it hard if you want to switch on the fly between the PC and X1, since removing the cable from the amplifier that's connected to the PC.- Build quality of plastic and synthetic is a bit disappointing considering the price tag.- Steep list price of $150 which I feel is too much for what you're getting.- Ear cups only swivel 90 degrees one way and 45 degrees the other way.- Not wireless.At the $150 range, the Turtle Beach Titanfall Ear Force Atlas Official Xbox One Xbox 360 PC Gaming Headset unfortunately falls a bit short to justify the initial asking price.  On the plus side, the noise isolation is decent and the audio quality is quite good for both games and music.  The inclusion of the X1 adapter allows you to personalize your gaming audio to maximize your playstyle.  The majority of games I've played so far have had crisp and clear highs, mids and lows without ever sounding dull, distant or hollow.  I've been playing multiple games (Thief, Payday 2, Titanfall and Dark Souls II) with all resulting in quality sound.  However, I feel that the list price is too high for what you're getting in the end.  I feel that this headset would be a more worthy investment around the $100-$130 range.  Personally, I feel there are better headset choices on the market for the current asking price.  However, if you're a Titanfall fan and want to complete your collection then the Turtle Beach Titanfall Ear Force Atlas Official Xbox One Xbox 360 PC Gaming Headset might be for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YOPBVFI9S0FP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRKE1SI#wasThisHelpful","R1YOPBVFI9S0FP","A3DH53FPYSP9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DH53FPYSP9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He was of course extremely excited when I approached with the bag (as he is with every new food) but that quickly changed after I dumped a little in his bowl.  Initially, he sniffed it and looked up at me as if to say ""What's this?""  He then took a small bite and promptly spit it out on the floor and walked away.  At this point I pretty much assumed he wasn't going to eat it unless he had nothing else.  Since I don't like to waste food I began to slowly mix it into his current food.  Every time he ate he would take a mouthful of the mixed food, spit it out on the floor and then eat only his current food Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Dogs, Large Breed 60+ Chicken Formula, 40 Pound Bag and leave the Hill's Ideal laying about.  Thankfully he's slowly become accepting of eating this food but only mixed with his current food.  Although my dog wasn't crazy about this food I really liked the ingredients.  However, the cost is a bit too high for me to purchase this on a regular basis.

"Recently I purchased a Motorola Moto X -  16GB, Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - White which unfortunately like many Android phones today doesn't come with a micro USB slot.

That being said, I had no reservations about testing another Corsair product with my portable devices and PC. Here are my thoughts on the Corsair Flash Voyager GO 32GB USB3.0 micro USB OTG Flash Drive for Android devices CMFVG-32GB-NA;Pros+ Compatible with Windows and Mac as well as Linux.+ Plug and play on select devices.+ Quickly transfer data between mobile devices and your PC/Mac without a cable.+ Small size (37mm long) and attaches to your keychain for easy portability.+ 5 year warranty.+ Affordable.Cons- Small size makes it very easy to misplace unless you have it a keychain.  It almost went to the wash a few times before I attached it to my keychain.- May have compatibility issues with many Android devices.  Currently the list of phones and tablets supported is terribly short without the use of a ES File Explorer App.- Transfer speeds may vary depending on the device or computer.- Female USB end doesn't have a cap which can easily collect dirt and dust.- Male USB end was an extremely tight fit on all of my devices.  So much so that I thought I was insert it incorrectly or that I might damage something.The Corsair Flash Voyager GO 32GB USB3.0 micro USB OTG Flash Drive for Android devices CMFVG-32GB-NA is a really great idea but a bit flawed in a few areas. While it's small, reliable and extremely efficient it has its share of issues with the main being lack of compatibility without using a ES File Explorer App.  I've used it with my Sony Xperia Z SGP311U1/B 10.1-Inch 16GB Tablet (no App needed), my Motorola Moto X -  16GB, Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - White (App needed) and multiple PC's (no App needed) with no problems whatsoever.  For its function it's also quite affordable compared to other flash drives on the market.  In my opinion the drives versatility alone makes it worth the purchase price if you want the ability to swap date between all of your devices. Despites my list of Cons, the Corsair Flash Voyager GO 32GB USB3.0 micro USB OTG Flash Drive for Android devices CMFVG-32GB-NA was a welcome addition to my family of ever-changing devices from a manufacturer I've come to trust.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MZ4Y5E4XMCLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVT27CW#wasThisHelpful","R3MZ4Y5E4XMCLH","A3DH53FPYSP9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DH53FPYSP9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We spend a lot of time in the kitchen around our house trying different recipes and foods, so we tend to try a lot of different cooking gadgets.  When you find a good one it becomes invaluable.  As we've gotten older eating healthier has definitely become more of a concern.  Enter the ""Philips HD9230/26 Digital AirFryer with Rapid Air Technology, Black."" Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Straight forward digital controls and extremely easy to use.+ Cooks extremely quickly and effectively.  The bottom rack takes a bit longer to cook more thoroughly depending on the food item.+ Use little to no oil to cook which makes for healthier eating.+ Food stays warms for quite some time after cooking is done when left in the tray.+ Additional attachments (sold separately) also allow you to bake and grill/roast as well.+ Very well packaged to prevent damage during transit.+ Auto shut-off once timer ends.+ Sleek look and simple design.Cons- Drawer and components are bothersome to hand wash after each use.  The bottom grill traps a lot of food drippings and even with a lot of soaking it can be difficult to get out and shreds sponges pretty quickly.- Components are not really dishwasher safe as advertised.  The basket and grilling rack quickly began to rust after only a few cycles.  Everything is now hand wash only to prevent further rusting.- Takes up a bit of counter space with its oval shape.  It's slightly larger than our KRUPS EA8250001 Espresseria Full Automatic Espresso Machine with Built-in Conical Burr Grinder, Black.- Additional Fry/Grill Pan and Non-Stick Baking Dish should really have come included.  They're another $40-50 each.- Basket size feels a bit small compared to other fryers on the market.  You can fit a regular bag of frozen French fries or four medium sized chicken breasts as an example.- Tray doesn't lock into the unit.  I found this rather surprising considering the amount of heat the units puts out to cook your food.  It felt a little dangerous to me as a curious child could easily pull this out and off the counter.- Quite expensive listing of $349 at the time of writing this review.- Digital interface can be a little sluggish and unresponsive.- Determining proper cook times takes some experimenting.- Poor instructions and lackluster cookbook.We were very impressed by the effectiveness of the Philips HD9230/26 Digital AirFryer with Rapid Air Technology, Black.  The fast cook time and tastiness of the finished food was quite surprising.  So far we've made chicken (all types of cuts), fish (swai and tilapia), bacon (very messy and you can't make a lot), burgers (also a greasy and messy clean up), various vegetables and of course French fries (perfect!).  It's important to note that the capacity of this fryer is rather small and better suited for one or two people.  I'd highly recommend this to those people who have a small space in which to cook or cook small meals.  Other than the small basket size I would say the overall cost is the biggest drawback to those looking to purchase this unit.  However, I'm sure many would love to receive it as a gift and would gladly put it on a wedding registry.  For the price of this machine it should definitely be considered an investment and some may consider it difficult to justify.  However, if you can afford the purchase price it definitely does what it's supposed to. I can absolutely say we've been more than satisfied with the Philips HD9230/26 Digital AirFryer with Rapid Air Technology, Black and I know our household will get many years of use out of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R232K17AZZO3T7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8OATGG#wasThisHelpful","R232K17AZZO3T7","A3DH53FPYSP9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DH53FPYSP9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying we currently don't have any children although they're in the future.  That being said, we do have limited counter space to dry our dishes.  Leaving out a regular-sized drying rack is not really an option so we've been looking for something compact and easy to store to help dry our plastic dishes.  Enter the Philips AVENT Drying Rack.  Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Easy to assemble, disassemble and store. Fits easily in a drawer.+ Bottom tray drains water away easily.+ Sturdy construction.Cons- Flexible design is a bit misleading as the drying arms are stiff plastic and can only be inserted one way into the tray.- Only safe to dry lightweight or plastic items on the rack.- Some items may be easily knocked off.- Unsure if the item is BPA free.The Philips AVENT Drying Rack is pretty standard.  There's really nothing terribly special about it and it does its drying job as well as expected.  Combined with our Envision Home Microfiber Dish Drying Mat, 16 by 18-Inch, Black we're able to dry the majority of our plastic and glass dishes with ease while taking up very little counter space.  The best part is when your items are finished drying both items are easily stored in a kitchen drawer.  When children enter our household the Philips AVENT Drying Rack will obviously get a lot more use drying all those plastic baby bottles and nipples.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IUM5ZHR2S3Y1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GULB24G#wasThisHelpful","R1IUM5ZHR2S3Y1","A3DH53FPYSP9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DH53FPYSP9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many people I've struggled with oily skin my entire life.  The oil traps dirt, clogs your pores and ultimately gives you acne.  Fun stuff.  As a teenager I suffered the worst of it.  Now, as an adult it's manageable but still an annoyance.  That being said I'm always on the lookout for different morning facial washes to use in the shower.  I've tried many Nivea products for men and have enjoyed the majority of them.  Therefore, I was more than happy to give Nivea for Men Sensitive Face Wash for Men, 5 Ounce a try.  Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Applies gently to your face.+ Sensitive formula doesn't irritate skin.+ No drying alcohol.+ Chamomile and Vitamin E ingredients.Cons- Tube design collects and retains water around the cap if kept in the shower.- Although the product is advertised as a perfume free formula there's a lingering perfume smell that stays with you long after you've rinsed the product from your face.- After 1-2 hours my face was oily again.  No different than any other facial cleanser I've used.Nivea for Men Sensitive Face Wash for Men, 5 Ounce just didn't cut it for me.  I didn't really see any noticeable change in my complexion after using it daily (sometimes twice) for a month, but I can say that about most facial cleansers.  Would I use it again?  Probably not.  The ""fragrance free formula"" was definitely not as advertised.  To be honest, my face smelled like Grandma's perfume for the majority of the day after use.  Not a scent I was particularly fond of and enjoy smelling.  However, since I like Nivea products I'm glad I gave it a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WZRIW2T1REZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXZS5VW#wasThisHelpful","R2WZRIW2T1REZ3","A3DH53FPYSP9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DH53FPYSP9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Schwartz fits a lot of goodness into a small package with Demon Hunter. Despite the unprepossessing cover, the book inside compares favorably to Ilona Andrews (especially her new Sweep series), with intriguing world-building and top-notch characters. My only complaint is that quite a few pages are devoted to explicit sex, which waters down the story a bit. Still, I'd snap up book two in a heartbeat should it become available.Speaking of the sequel --- I was a bit leery to begin book one without knowing if book two is slated for release anytime soon.

"Ellen O'Connell is currently tied with Laura Florand as my favorite romance author. Their books are entirely different, but both share an astonishing ability to combine a page-turning, character-driven story with a setting so vivid you feel like you've gone on vacation in a different country or, in the case of O'Connell, in a different time.Fascinating historical tidbits aside, Into the Light is my favorite of O'Connell's books because of the love story. How could you not enjoy two wounded souls drawn together when they meet on city benches in the dark? Neither knows the other's identity, with both predictable and unpredictable results.My only complaint? I've only got two O'Connell books left.

"I'll start with the potentially bad. My Tomorrow is very solidly a New Adult book, so it's not surprising that there's a strong thread of moral ambiguity running through the plot. In the end, I felt like that element made the book more real and deep, but if you want a simple romance with no cheating, this story might not be for you.Okay, with that out of the way, I can definitely say that this is Isbell's best book to date. As soon as you meet Drew, you'll fall in love with him and will be unable to put the book down. Drew is a handsome, wealthy, self-made architect who is, first and foremost, the perfect gentleman. So what's he to do when attracted to his assistant who's ensconced in a four-year-relationship with her live-in boyfriend?My other warning --- you'll be incapable of turning the last page without yearning for book two.

"So, Susan's Grant's world reminds me an awful lot of the Star Wars universe...which is great! Especially since she adds in strong female characters and believable romances to make that knockoff universe sing.I enjoyed the first book in this series enough to try The Star Prince, but I'll admit that Grant's first effort had flawed pacing. This sequel, though, is 1,000% better, with the same tantalizing feel but in a much more cohesive package.

"So many romance novels seem to be written for teenagers. There's lots of in-depth description of sex, but no real depth to the emotional bond being built between the two characters.Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold is the exact opposite. The slow growth of love between the two protagonists is beautiful and their struggle to overcome their era's racism fascinating and thought-provoking.I have two true markers of an A++ book --- first it keeps me up too late reading, and second I cry at the end.

"I adore post-apocalyptic novels, but sometimes the violence and bad choices of characters faced with a new disaster is just too depressing. Ice Diaries was such a delightful change, keeping the best parts of the genre while deleting most of the violence and unsavoriness.The book begins a year after a pandemic wipes out of most of the world's population, followed by an abrupt climate shift that buries London under 60 feet of snow. We open in a little community of posh Londoners who are getting by quite happily raiding supermarkets for their supplies, gathering together for ceilidhs, and looking out for one another. Our heroine is kind and spunky, but is still mourning her lost boyfriend, whom she assumes is now dead.Enter a semi-thug dying of a knife-wound and hypothermia while lying in the snow outside her flat, and the story is off! I won't tell you about the middle because most things I say would be spoilers, but the end is fully satisfying while also leaving me yearning for a sequel.

"Twice Born is intriguingly different from your run-of-the-mill shifter book. It's solidly urban fantasy instead of paranormal romance, with plenty of world-building (set in Australia, which makes it doubly different!). The story starts with a bang, following a character who's lost her memory of the last few hours but who just vaguely remembers blood dripping from her hands. How could you put that down?I don't want to tell you much more, because this book's twistiness is one of its best points. There are mysteries within mysteries, and it's intriguing watching our heroine figure out what's going on. Unfortunately, I feel like that twistiness went a bit too far --- thus four stars instead of five. A bit of foreshadowing of one element that shows up near the end would have made me more emotionally invested in the book and brought me through a middle that otherwise felt too long. Or perhaps the author should have just cut out a hundred pages or so. (I do like my books short and sweet.)But the end more than made up for that slight flaw, and I'm looking forward to book two. On for more twists and turns and dragon shifters!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XYO8TIXIO8KW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGD1IIW#wasThisHelpful","R1XYO8TIXIO8KW","A1GJ58TW0XTTVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GJ58TW0XTTVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I shouldn't have delayed. Because Fortier's beautifully illustrated and easy to read book fills in gaps in my production campaign, giving me ideas for streamlining production so my crops will be more bountiful with less work.

The art is intriguing, and although I didn't watch any of the videos (I'm just not a video person), I suspect they also added depth to the text. Finally, there are the hands-on exercises that bring what you've learned into the truly personal sphere.The really powerful part, though, was the several different points of view, one of which will likely present a perspective that speaks to you. There's an Indian-Kenyan-English searcher for truth, a Rabbi who has lived on three continents, and an anthropologist intrigued by the human life cycle.

"I've been burned so many times by Kindle First books that I now look at them a bit askance. But Boundary Crossed proved me wrong. Olson's tale is full of unique worldbuilding, follows a flawed by lovable heroine, and left me wanting more (without ending on a cliffhanger).

"I'm always intrigued by comic-book-style stories, but usually end up disappointed. I like the alternative worlds where people with superpowers keep the common guy safe, but the two-dimensionality of the characters generally turns me off.Luckily, Vigilant has all of the pluses of a comic-book story with none of the minuses. Our heroine is particularly enticing, a great blend of power and vulnerability. As I later learned in the author's note, Lawson spent years working with troubled kids as a social worker, and that part of the story rang particularly true. I also enjoyed the mystery --- are the men in her life normal joes, superheroes, or supervillians? The ending isn't a cliffhanger, but does leave you wanting more, and I'm looking forward to checking out book two when it becomes available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25RHEPJBAS58X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGETQ94#wasThisHelpful","R25RHEPJBAS58X","A1GJ58TW0XTTVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GJ58TW0XTTVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been lucky enough to hear Tradd speak in person a few times, and his lectures are always visually appealing, intellectually revealing, and completely inspiring. His book is more of the same --- which is to say awesome!I've been particularly wanting more information on rafts, totems, and propagating mushrooms on cardboard, and this book form of the lectures I'd attended didn't disappoint. In addition to providing step-by-step directions (with great diagrams and photos) on those topics, the text provided additional home-scale experiments that I'm itching to try, including propagating shiitakes using stacked rounds, raising oyster mushrooms on old clothes and coffee grounds, and producing homegrown morel spawn/microbe slurry for outside inoculation. (If you have no idea what I'm talking about, don't worry --- the beginning of the book has great information to bring beginners up to speed.)The last third of the book consists of species-by-species cultivation accounts, and I'll save that for more intensive reading later. For now, this book is one of the few titles --- about three to five per year --- that contains such a breadth and depth of information that it merits a permanent place on my bookshelf.For those of you new to mushrooms, this is probably the book I'd recommend reading first. It's like a combination of the inspiring accounts of Mycelium Running with the hands-on information of Stamets' older text, but with a more homestead-scale appeal. But I should warn you that you'll need to commit serious time to reading Tradd's chapters slowly and in order since my initial skim was a bit disappointing --- raising more questions than it answered. Only after I read every word did the true wonder of the book gel together into a beautiful whole. So even if you're an intermediate mushroom growing, start with chapter one and prepare to be inspired!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X1A2NQELMLZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1603584552#wasThisHelpful","R1X1A2NQELMLZV","A1GJ58TW0XTTVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GJ58TW0XTTVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I almost never pick up a fiction book by a man nowadays because they generally lack the heart I'm looking for. The Neon Lawyer is a notable exception to that rule.Victor Methos does a superb job taking a Grisham-like story down to the common man by following a new lawyer who has been working as a janitor in the book's opening scenes. You'll enjoy all of the characters, from the seedy mob-related lawyer who eventually hires our hero to the woman our hero is employed to defend. The story is fast-paced, just the right length, and will keep its claws firmly rooted in your stomach after you turn the last page.

"Sometimes I wonder why an excellent book like this is out of print and barely read while similar books are still going strong decades later. Sure, Stille's book is slightly rough around the edges, with a few more typos than I'd like to see. And some goat keepers may disagree with some of her advice (but isn't that always the case?).On the other hand, The Goat Care Handbook is the perfect example of a book written from firsthand experience. Stille has been keeping goats for decades, and her attentiveness to their behavior shows through.In fact, I stumbled across her book while googling about trimming hooves on pregnant does --- my gut said that I shouldn't wrestle with Mama Goat in her nearly-due state, but I couldn't seem to find any evidence to back up that impression. Luckily, Stille agreed with me. ""Don't trim the hooves of a pregnant doe after the third month of gestation,"" she warns, ""unless she is very docile because her struggles may harm her and the unborn kids."" She also offered excellent advice in preparing for kidding (trimming the hair on her back legs and udders, etc.) and when and how to help during birth.In the end, I still recommend Storey's Guide to Dairy Goats as the first goat book to read, but this or Raising Goats Naturally would make a good second opinion. Or, better yet, read all three....","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJVNCE0PLTTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A6FZJY6#wasThisHelpful","R1PJVNCE0PLTTW","A1GJ58TW0XTTVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GJ58TW0XTTVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The run-of-the-mill cover hides the fact that this is an exceptionally good book. It has all of the elements I love --- unique world-building (urban fantasy with daemons and half daemons), a great heroine, and an intriguing love interest (who's almost a dragon). If I had to make complaints, my minor nitpicks would be the presence of infodumps (although all of the information dumped is very useful for the plot later) and slightly rough ebook formatting. But that wasn't enough to keep me from reading up late and then picking up book two immediately.On the other hand, if you hate cliffhangers, you may or may not have a gripe with this book. I didn't really consider the ending a cliffhanger since the plot was resolved...although the author does then introduce a new problem to keep you on the edge of your seat. Chances are that, like me, you'll *need* to know what happens next, but if you want to quit after book one, you can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3545MTYV91FFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGSQ9ES#wasThisHelpful","R3545MTYV91FFQ","A1GJ58TW0XTTVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GJ58TW0XTTVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With her third novel, Meara is really starting to hit her stride and find her own unique voice. I enjoyed the way A Boy Named Rabbit felt different from most mainstream offerings, more like a Gene Stratton-Porter book, perhaps mixed in with a bit of A Little Princess.Once again, the Appalachian setting provided the perfect foil for a well-turned story. With some wilderness survival, a healthy dose of suspense, gentle at-home scenes, and a tinge of paranormal activity, A Boy Named Rabbit has something for everyone.

"Do not trust your sanity or your life to these units.  Our house built in 2010 has 8 of these units and now 4 of them have failed.

(Pulling the battery and unplugging from the hardwire for a few minutes will fix it sometimes).  Unidentified and mysterious chirping happens too.  The units will occasionally start triple-chirping which is some other issue, not the battery.  Search the manual all you want, there is no reason for the triple-chirp.Oh, and that 7 year warranty?  Good luck with that.  Even though our appliances, carpet, and fixtures came with manufacturer warranty with our brand new house, BRK won't honor their warranty.

"This Emergency Release Lock Kit is the ""standard"" configuration for every type of lock like this.  It will fit in the hole that is pre-stamped in steel doors and the bolt holes will line up correctly.  As others have noted, this is NOT a Genie part, but it works.  If you are really worried about high security on this lock, maybe you shouldn't install it at all because popping open a garage door is pretty darn easy with or without one of these release locks.  This device just makes it so you don't do damage to the door to release the garage door opener in case of power outage or malfunction.Also note that this is a unit with the shorter cable, about 24 inches.  Remember, shorter doesn't mean worse, it just means shorter.  If the cable is too long for your needs you will have to shorten it or you risk a problem with it hanging down when the door is up and a larger possibility of it getting tangled up when you need to use it.  It's really easier to extend a cable that is too short rather than shorten one that is too long...just add a piece of nylon cord.  If you already have one installed and need a new one, measure the current cable.  If you are installing it for the first time, take a piece of string from the intended installation position to find out what length cable you need.I agree with other reviewers, the seller should be required to disclose the actual brand.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SUGG11EK0X4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EX4F30#wasThisHelpful","R3SUGG11EK0X4I","A1XCHEMKKMVFPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCHEMKKMVFPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the genuine Kohler set that will also fit their other line brands Sterling, Wellworth, Highline, Northline, and Barrington.  Basically, if you look into the top of the tank and you see 3 screw heads in a triangular pattern, this will be the kit you need 99% of the time.Don't make the mistake of replacing only the triangular gasket, the leak is commonly from a hairline crack in the valve tube and you'll save yourself lots of time by just replacing all of it at once.  Read the instructions and follow them carefully as the nut on the bottom is often over tightened and this will result in continued leakage or cracking of the valve tube assembly.Be aware that this kit does NOT include the screws.  You need to replace the screws as I'll guarantee your originals are corroded.Why only 4 star?  The kit is original manufacturer parts and they're as good as they get, but the reality is it is very expensive for what it is and at this price they should include the screws that you have to have.  It's a horrible design that is destined to give you issues with leakage into the bowl and always causes more work when doing repairs.  The cost for the seal between the tank and commode for most other toilets is less than $2.

"We own rental units and now place Schlage Keypad Deadbolts on all of them.  They are very easy to install and use.  These keypad deadbolts work differently than a lot of the competitor's keypad deadbolts.  The Schlage does not move the bolt automatically, it just engages the handle when an authorized code is entered and you do the work to move the bolt.Is that better?  In a word, yes.  We have used other brands that move the bolt automatically and there are disadvantages to these units.  They are slow and on a very cold night you may find weak batteries will leave YOU out in the cold.  We installed our first unit in our home over 3 years ago and used the included 9-volt battery (not expecting it to last too long) and it is still going strong.  Since it only uses the battery to read codes and engage the handle, the little 9-volt will last a very long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HEUQGFJT5Z9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AT97YA#wasThisHelpful","R1HEUQGFJT5Z9J","A1XCHEMKKMVFPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XCHEMKKMVFPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I picked up this case looking for a something that would be simple to put on and take off and something that would be thin, but provide ample protection from falls.  When I received this case, it met these criteria, but it also impressed me in other ways.  For one, its hard to see in the photos, but the case is molded with indented areas on the back which aid in gripping your phone.  When I picked the phone up, my thumb easily found the iPhone button placements on the left, while my remaining four fingers seemed to automatically utilize this indented area for gripping while pushing the buttons.  So from a grip and drop standpoint, I like the case a lot.  Secondly, the camera holes on the back are perfectly designed so that they don't interfere with either the lens or the flash.  This may seem a no-brainer, but I can't tell you how many times I've purchased low priced cases that simply prove to be worthless, because they interfere with photo taking.  Speaker, earphone and lightning adapter cutouts are also perfect.  And lastly, as far as esthetics, I really liked the transparency which allowed my iPhones design to shine through, and the ""toughness"" of the plastic material which is a bit stiffer than plastic or silicon cases I've purchased in the past.  In terms of protection, I feel that case provides ample protection from most drops, although luckily, I've yet to experience any drops as of yet.  The corner protection seems good, the back protection of course is excellent since its totally covered, and in terms of the face protection, the case should protect the phone from flat surface drops but like most other cases of this type, if it drops just right on a pebble or something, your screen will probably crack or be scratched.  It's just the nature of the beast.  If you want full protection, you simply need to buy more of an armored case.  So given that the case meets protection standards that I feel are acceptable for the type of design, I cannot fault the case in any way in terms of protection.  For the money and features, I highly recommend this case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TS5UVJQW7V36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFCN9LY#wasThisHelpful","R2TS5UVJQW7V36","A4SJSQTL0P6KI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SJSQTL0P6KI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just received my Etekcity digital postal/luggage scale and I love it.  Why?  Well, first it's small enough to not add significant bulk to your luggage.  After all, what good is a luggage scale if it adds enough weight where you have to remove something in order to meet your airlines luggage restrictions?  Second, it has a ""zeroing"" function which could come in handy for a number of reasons.  Lets say you want to weigh an anchor, but in order to hang the anchor on the scale, you need to include a short piece of chain which you don't want to weigh?  Well, with the zeroing function, you'd first hang the chain on the scale and let it record its weight.  Then you'd hit the zero button to tell the scale that the weight of the hanging chain is zero pounds.  You'd then connect the anchor to the chain and reweigh.  Now the scale would reflect the weight of just the anchor because you effectively negated the weight of the chain with the ""zeroing"" function.Another nice feature of this small scale is that it has the ability to record weight in kilograms or pounds, and records pounds to the nearest 10th of a pound or kilograms to the nearest 1/100th of a kilogram.  The scale also measures ambient air temperature in either centigrade or fahrenheit scales.  Both can be measured to the nearest 10th of a degree centigrade or fahrenheit.  Why one would want to measure temperature with a luggage scale however, is beyond me, but it does appear to be fairly accurate, as the scale compared well next to a thermometer I bought several years ago, which was designed for the specific purpose of recording outdoor temperatures.Some other points I like about the scale is that it comes with a battery and since it's a coin battery, having to buy one would have been a bummer because I sure don't have spare coin batteries lying around.  I also like its ergonomics....in other words, how it was designed for its intended purpose.  It was designed to be held in a human hand and figuring that there would be a heavy bag hanging from the end of it, it allows the bag to be hung close to the scale itself.  Why is this important?  Because there's nothing worse than having to live the bag 12 inches in the air before the scale can even begin to record the weight.  The Etekcity scale comes with a hanging strap that can be adjusted to different handle configurations to insure it doesn't have to hang to far away from the scale itself.I highly recommend this scale if you travel a lot.  And if you're simply looking for a digital scale but not interested in using it to weigh luggage?  Well, it should do this just fine as long as what you have to weigh can be hung, or place onto or into something that can be hung.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CZ3U0EI4KDEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NW62PCA#wasThisHelpful","R2CZ3U0EI4KDEI","A4SJSQTL0P6KI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SJSQTL0P6KI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you're reading this review, please note that I'm referring to the $49 UT-61A model....not the $9.99 model....  which is the problem with a lot of the reviews you'll read related to this listing, and that is that 99% of the reviewers fail to denote which model they're referring to.  That's right, all the reviews for all three models under this one listing, are grouped together.  It's comical how some reviewers start off by saying ""I'm not sure how other reviewers gave this item a 5 star""....  Which item?  You won't know unless the reviewer tells you which item.  Oh you might get hints because they'll describe the item and then and only then, would you realize that they're probably not talking about the same product.Anyways, as I mentioned, this review is about the $49 UT-61A model.  I mentioned in the title that it's built like a tank?  Well, I've owned several multimeters over the years, and most were the size of one of those kiddie orange juice cartons that you put their lunch pails.  This multimeter?  Well, when the Amazon box game, I was surprised to get a delivery that weighed so much and was so large.  I didn't order anything from Amazon that large or heavy, but when I opened up the box, I realized it was actually the Etekcity Multimeter.  And when I took it out of its own box, I was flabbergasted to see how large and heavy it was.  Not that I cared about this, but I was expecting some small, lightweight multimeter.  But this....this seemed to be the multimeter of multimeters!I used to work in Aerospace and the company used to have a saying that if it looks good, it will fly good.  Well, I believe in that axiom because in order to make something look good and feel good in your hands, it usually is an indicator that equal thought went into it's design because the company spent extra time and effort on the build quality.... so why would they scrimp on the build quality on the inside?  I realize this isn't always true, but in the case of this multimeter, it's my opinion that it's built well and built to last.First off, it's encased in this extremely thick rubber housing.  The tolerances on how it fits to the inner multimeter housing and face is visibly tight.  No loose housing on this baby.  Weight?  The multimeter weighs in at just under a pound!  The plastic screen is void of any visible defects and is clear as glass...(maybe it is glass?)  And it's size was unexpected....About 7 inches tall, 3-1/4 inches wide and just under 2 inches thick, it's no kiddy orange juice pack in size....no, this baby is about the size of a brick.  Now this didn't bother me, but if you're looking for something small that you can put in your pocket, you better have baggy pants!  I'm happy because this thing is built to last and I wasn't necessarily looking for something too mobile.  Still, it's easy to carry and doesn't weigh anything close to a brick.As far as functions, I won't go into that because in looking at the item's general description, I think it covers what overall functions this multimeter provides.  But I thought I'd go over a few functions I like that you may make you consider this more expensive version of Etekcity's like of multimeters.  First of, this has auto ranging.  What is that you ask?  Well, you may be able to make out on the pictures of the UT-61A model, that it has no range selections on the dial like a normal multimeter.  This is because usually, you manually have to select the range you think the item your measuring for capacitance, resistance or voltage, might have.  Auto ranging allows the multimeter to determine this for you.  This means that you won't have to guess and better yet, it's less wear and tear on the dial mechanism because you only set the dial once to what you're trying to measure, and the multimeter will will automatically determine the proper range to set.  (About the dial...this is another indicator of build quality.  No cheapie feel to the movement of this thing.  It's movement from selection to selection is solid and the dial doesn't feel loose.  And the connection point of the test leads is also solid in feel.)The other features I like are the auto shut down feature.  After 30 seconds, it will perform a self shutoff, which should save battery life.  Lastly, I like the readout....extremely clear LCD display with large characters (over a 1/2 inch in size) make the display pleasingly visible.  There's also a controllable backlight in case you're working in a dark environment....  which is often the case if you're using you're multimeter to figure out why the lamp light went out and you're in the dark!Overall, I highly recommend this multimeter!  It works like a charm and I see no reason to rate it other than with 5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37TCOKMR8T02L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NW62L88#wasThisHelpful","R37TCOKMR8T02L","A4SJSQTL0P6KI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SJSQTL0P6KI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I give this scale 5 Stars.  It's simple to use, straight forward operation is all one needs in a device meant simply to weigh one's weight.  After you put the two provided AAA batteries in the battery well underneath the scale, you simply have to turn it over, place it on a flat surface, stand evenly on the scale and wallah!....  Your weight is provided on the digital display.  Yet, as simple to use as this scale is, it does provide some key features one might look for, even in a scale as simple as this one.  First, the display is bright and easy to read in this regard.  To enhance readability further, the numerals are large and easily readable.  Second, the scale automatically turns on when weight is applied on it, and it conserves battery life automatically, by turning itself off after a few seconds.  Lastly, the design of the scale is very stylish with its sharp lines, low profile and glassy surface.  finally, the scale seems accurate.  While I wasn't able to determine how accurate it is in relation to a certified scale, I can vouch for its accuracy in the sense that it returned the same reading time and time again after weighing myself within a two minute period.  And after all....For a device whose intent usually will be to show fairly accurate weight in order to allow the user to judge the progress of diets and/or exercise, accuracy in terms of consistency is more important than how accurate the scale is in relation to a extremely accurate certified scale costing hundreds of dollars.  As such, I highly recommend this scale to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B0BJEQ9ZZ9BN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3J9G1W#wasThisHelpful","R3B0BJEQ9ZZ9BN","A4SJSQTL0P6KI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SJSQTL0P6KI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's my thoughts upon my recent purchase of the Etekcity 4 Port High Speed HDMI Switcher.  The switch was shipped promptly by Eteckcity and arrived in perfect condition.  While the packing of the product isn't important to many, I often take notice of how a products package is designed and how well the item is packed and presented.  I say this because more often than not, how a product is presented is often indicative of the company's due diligence by it's original manufacturer, towards the design of the product itself.  In the case of this HDMI switch, the switch came in a well designed box, with compartments to safely ship the individual components.  The switch's shiny plastic surface was protected from scratches by a thin sheet of film, and the remote control was wrapped in plastic for protection as well  The 3rd and last component (other than the instruction guide) was the AC adapter, whose cord was wound and bound for safe transport.  All in all, it seems some level of thought was placed into the packaging of the switch.  One other thing about the packaging.  The remote control uses a battery which was already installed in the remote, but the again, the manufacturer took time to design its packaging in such a fashion that the battery is prevented from being active from the time it was inserted, by the insertion of a thin plastic strip that sat between the battery and its contacts.  Once I removed the strip, the remote was ready to function.In terms of use, the HDMI switch is easy to use.  It's function is to receive inputs through multiple HDMI cables providing input signals from high definition sources such as TV's, gaming consoles, etc..... then allow that signal to be distributed to one HDMI output port on the switch.  Hence the 4 ports as described in the products description.  1 output port and 3 input ports.So why would someone need a switch like this?  In my case, I had an issue which the switch helped solve.  I have a flat screen TV which only has 3 input HDMI ports on it.  But as you might have guessed, i have way more devices that I often connect to the TV (Xbox, Playstation 3, overhead projector, gaming recorder, laptop, etc).  Two of the HDMI ports on my TV are on the back and because they're a pain to get to, I never touched the cables connected to those ports.  Instead, I was constantly pulling out and inserting HDMI cables into the third HDMI port on the side of the TV, and I realized that at some point, the connection to this third port would eventually wear out.  What I needed was a switch where I could connect the HDMI cables from the devices I wanted to use, then just select the one I wanted and have that signal sent to the TV through a cable I could leave connected at all times.  The Eteckcity switch was the answer and solved this problem flawlessly.Once I connected the HDMI cables from my 3 source devices and connected the single HDMI cable to my TV, I was ready to put the switch through its paces.  Once I turned on the source device i wanted to watch (in this case, my Xbox on port 2), I then switched my TV to the appropriate input.  When I turned on the TV, nothing was being displayed yet, but as soon as I took the remote control to swich to port 2, I was able to see my Xbox.  The picture was perfect with no visible distortions apparent from having to be sent through the switch.  How simple was that?  The Eteckcity switch worked as described.I should state at this point, that while the swich came with an instruction manual, but i didn't need to use it.  It seemed intuitive to me that I needed to connect the right cables coming in, connect the output cable to my TV, then simply turn everything on and switch the the right port on the switch.  However, the manual does describe some other functions that I don't plan on using.  One function would have been the ability of the switch to select between various output options such as 2 channel audio, 5.1 surround sound and 7.1 surround sound.  I say would have because this audio selectability feature is not supported on this switch.  I wouldn't have been able to test this for anyone anyway, since my set up only uses 2 channel sound.  But for those attempting to switch between 2 channel and surround channel sources over this switch, may want to contact the manufacturer to see if surround sound would be sent through the switch even if it was not selectable.  The manual did not say.  Why the remote shows this function is probably because the manufacturer wanted to make a remote that could be supported by several of it's products, including a product more advanced than this model.  I am not aware as to whether Etekcity sells a more advanced switch that uses this remote.  Again, you should contact them directly to find out, if you're interested in using this switch with a home set up that must use something other than (or in a addition to) 2 channel audio.The other feature that the manual describes on the remote, apparently is supported. It's the ability of the switch to support between multiple pictures displayed in a ""picture in picture"" signal.  Unfortunately, I was not able to test this for other prospective customers since none of my devices is currently leveraging picture in picture (PIP) functionality.  But I'm assuming that it provides the ability to connect a device with two or ore pictures being displayed on the one signal, and then be able to select through the remote, which of the pictures on the single single you want displayed.  Again, this is just my guess as to what this function supports.  The manual doesn't describe it's function in any detail, so you'll need to contact the manufacturer if you need that capability.In summary on the remote, there are many more buttons than you'll need (or be able to) use.  The manual describes which are functional with this switch and which are not.In summary on the switch, it's easy to set up, easy to use and functions well.  It's a simple switch, whose remote offers a nice touch (you don't have to get up in order to switch between input sources.  Just push a button).  And, I liked the price.  For me, it was just what the doctor ordered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12QCR19GMH255/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9642JS#wasThisHelpful","R12QCR19GMH255","A4SJSQTL0P6KI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SJSQTL0P6KI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Today, I received my Etekcity, T3 Bluetooth Wireless speaker and I have to say that while I was looking for a small bluetooth, wireless speaker to listen to podcasts, I didn't expect the quality and performance I received in such a small device.Packaging:  First, the packaging.  The packaging was pretty impressive.  Sort of what you'd expect from a company like Apple.  But this product is from Etekcity and they didn't disappoint.  In my view, the package design often reflects the build quality of the product itself and as I'll explain later in my review, the design, quality and performance of the T3 speaker is fantastic.  So when I opened the shipping box to find such an impressive looking (albeit small) box, I immediately was excited and hopeful that the speaker would follow suit.  Opening the T3's outer box ""shell"" yielded further evidence of design carefully engineered to protect, separate and display the speaker and it's supporting contents.Box Contents:  Inside the beautifully designed packaging was the T3 wireless speaker, a USB charging cable, an instruction manual, and a surprise in the form of a cloth case to carry he speaker in when traveling.  NOTE:  the charging cable isn't very long so if you do not have other ""mini"" USB cables handy (not the newer ""micro"" USB cable often used with newer devices), jus keep his in mind.  Also, a charger is not supplied, so keep this mind also.  You can charge the T3 with a standard 1 amp or 2.1 amp charger provided with many of today's cell phones or simply charge the T3 by connecting it to a USB port on your PC or Mac.Start Up:  Getting the device connected was a snap.  I simply powered the T3 on, went to my iPhone's bluetooth setup and within about a minute, my iPhone ""discovered"" the T3, enabling me to hit the connect option on my iPhone.  Within seconds, my iPhone was ""paired"" with the T3 and I was ready for a sound test.  When attempting to pair devices such as the T3 to a computer, tablet or cell phone over Bluetooth, the device often has to placed into a ""pairing"" mode before it can be ""discovered"". In the case of hue T3, no such pairing mode was required.  The T3 connected flawlessly and in addition, it has continued to do so automatically after being turned off, or my iPhone Bluetooth was turned back on from an ""off"" state.Performance:  how do I describe performance?  Well, a Bose Bluetooth speaker it is not.  But neither is it as big as one either.  Holding the T3 in my hand, I'd describe it as being around the size of a tennis ball.  Bit it's cylindrical, so maybe a better description on its size would be like a jar of jelly that's 1/2 the height.  Despite its size, it took my podcast and made me forget that the sound I was hearing was originating from my iPhone.  The sound was deep, loud, with no audible distortion.  Not bad for a half of pint of jelly!Design:  besides the T3's size, the design of the T3 features an on/off button, a volume up button, volume down button, a button for pausing or playing audio content, a port to connect the mini USB cable, a headphone jack for listening to the sound streamed to the T3 silently over a headphone, and a tiny light hat flashes to indicate charging/charged conditions as well as pairing status.  On the bottom of the speaker, the T3 was designed such that when it is placed on a table, vibrations would be dampened.  In my tests, turning the sound all the way to max, did not yield any vibrating noises from the speaker.  The bottom of the speaker is also designed with tiny holes, which probably are used to increase the T3's bass response.  Finally, the design of the speaker is made so that the sound is projected from the very top.  Sound is not projected from the sides.  In fact the sides are surrounded with rubber for a nice tactile feel when handling the T3.Conclusion:  the Etekcity T3 Bluetooth Wireless speaker is a well assembled, well designed product that should give you years of quality use.  When expectations are paired correctly with proper use scenarios, it will meet your every expectation.  Similarly, purchase the T3 thinking you're going to shake the house down with the latest House and Techno music hits and you'll have unfairly set performance requirements never meant to be met with a speaker of this size.  With all this said, I highly recommend the T3 to anyone searching for a wireless, bluetooth speaker to extend/amplify the sound of tablets and cell phones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R67Q8FZDC6XZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDXV5GO#wasThisHelpful","R67Q8FZDC6XZ4","A4SJSQTL0P6KI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SJSQTL0P6KI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think having bought 3 of these recommend Water Right hoses over time probably convinces you, but if not, let me explain why I recommend this hose.First off, take my word for it when I say that you've probably never seen a hose like this at a hardware store, Target, Walmart, etc.  it may be its polyurethane composition or simply how it's made, but the minute you take it out of the box, you know it's made differently.  it's hard to describe why, but it just feels and looks better designed and made.  This has translated into great ""coiling"" characteristics.  It uncoils straight when needed, but when you're ready to put it away, it seems to coil however tight you want to have your coil for storage.  When it does get pinched, it immediately springs back with no visible creases nor any feeling as if the pinch is a reflection of the hoses wall weakness.  Instead, it's construction makes you feel confident that this hose will handle pinches forever.Other great features of this hose is the high quality connection hardware and safety.  The connectors look and feel high quality and the hose is guaranteed to be drinking water safe.The last thing I'll pass on to you is it's diameter.  This is a half inch hose so if you're used to the higher water delivery of more standard hoses you seem at your local hardware store, you might want to buy Water Rights ""high delivery"" rate model.  I don't believe that Amazon offers this version yet, but for myself, my opinion is that this ""slim"" version is adequate enough for any home use.  In fact, I believe before Water Right began selling their high delivery version, they provided test results for water delivery rates between their slim design hose and standard garden hoses and the differences were negligible ...  But if you feel you need a higher water rate for some special applications, look at their website to get info on the high delivery model.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M2TLE8NBNZ5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003P9XAB4#wasThisHelpful","R1M2TLE8NBNZ5B","A4SJSQTL0P6KI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SJSQTL0P6KI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I guess if you're reading this review, you may have been like me ...  In that you have a nice lawn being invaded by clovers or that dreaded Oxalis weed.  And you're probably wondering the same two things....  First, does it work and second, will it kill my grass.  Well, from my observations, the answer to the first question is yes, but for Oxalis, it may take a couple treatments.  I noticed that it has definitely affected the Oxalis, but because it's such an evasive, strong weed, it's leaves turned brown but the roots seem like they're still unaffected.  I'm hoping its early yet and the leaves are an early sign that it will eventually die.  But for sure, this particular variant of Scott's Weed-B-Gone has been formulated to systemically affect Oxalis.  I'll try to remember to update this review at a layer point in time, but even though my Oxalis doesn't appear to be ""dead-dead"", I'm satisfied that I found something that addresses it.As for the regular grass...  Well....  Good news!  So far at least, my regular grass seems unaffected.  And it remains so after a good drenching of Weed-B-Gone with a garden hose attachable sprayer.  So this made me even more pleased.The product seems to work as advertised, and even if it takes awhile to kill the Oxalis (or simply halts it's advancement) I'm happy.  Because at least I have something in my arsenal that affects Oxalis specifically and will not kill my Marathon Lawn...!  :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FDQFA3A8VXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035H276K#wasThisHelpful","R30FDQFA3A8VXN","A4SJSQTL0P6KI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SJSQTL0P6KI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Today I received my Etekcity Wireless-N Wifi Repeater.  Here's my thoughts on the product.BOX AND CONTENTS - Upon opening the box, I found some fairly decent instructions along with an ethernet cable and the repeater device itself.DOCUMENTATION - On a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being best, for the documentation I'd say it rates an 8.  I've definitely seen better but I've also seen way more that were worse.  I docked the instruction manual 2 points because there were points in the documentation where it became obvious that a translation probably occurred into English, from it's original language.  None-the-less, even with a few translation issues, the documentation was easy to read and understand.  And for Windows users, the diagrams/images pretty much matched what I encountered when navigating the various steps towards getting my repeater up and running.  For Mac users (I actually have both Mac and Windows devices), the diagrams did not match what I saw through my Mac setup interface, but the the Repeater is so simple to set up, the minor differences really didn't hamper me from configuring it a second time through a Mac.SETUP - There are two basic modes for setup.  There's whats called a ""Wireless Repeater"" setup, where the repeater basically is set up to take your routers wireless signal and repeat it wirelessly, using the same Service Set ID (SSID) and password as the router, or there's a ""Wireless AP Mode"" setup, where the repeater is hardwired to the router via an ethernet cable, and a wireless signal is repeated from the location where the ethernet cable terminates into the repeater.  Quite frankly, i'm not sure why anyone would want to use the Wireless AP Mode.  One usually buys a repeater to get a better signal in a remote part of ones house or property and doing so by wiring the repeater to the router seems to defeat the purpose of the repeater.  But I'm sure there must be some situations where this would prove useful and/or the better option.  For myself, I chose the Wireless Repeater option.  So I navigated to the portion of the documentation that referenced this setup and in seven simple steps, the Repeater was configured.PERFORMANCE - I didn't apply any scientific tests to test performance of the Repeater.  But in my view, the real test is whether the Repeater solved the problem I expected it to, and in my case, the issue I had was a need to get a better signal out to my garage, so that my treadmill could receive a better wireless signal to allow me to play videos from the internet while exercising.  Did it meet my expectations?  With flying colors.  I had configured the Repeater in the house by plugging it into a socket next to my PC and Mac.  But after I configured the Repeater, I carried it out to the garage and placed it in sort of a ""middle ground"" location.  As soon as I booted up my treadmill, I was able to see that I had a solid Wifi signal and immediately, I was able to start playing around with the built-in web browser!!!OTHER - As with most other repeaters and wireless extenders, the Etekcity Wireless N Wifi Repeater comes with built-in software that allows you to configure and manage the device.  You initially log into the repeater with a default username and pass, but you can change the default within the software.  Also, when initially setting up the Repeater, you log into the repeater by connecting to it wirelessly as you would any other network.  It comes set up with a default SSID, which I was easily able to locate with my network card, and you shouldn't have to change this, but the software does allow you to change this default SSID (and associated password and security settings).  I did try playing with this feature, but I wasn't able to determine how this would be used, simply because the whole purpose of configuring the Repeater is so that it can REPEAT your router's SSID, pass and security settings at the remote location.  Once this is set up, the repeater reboots itself and at that point, as far as I was able to tell, even if you had changed the repeaters own default SSID, pass and security settings, you can't connect to the repeater through these settings once its rebooted.  Once it's configured and rebooted, the only SSID i was able to view was my router's repeated SSID.There are some other advanced settings in the Repeater that are available for modification from the software's interface, however I because I didn't have a need to modify any of these settings (at least not yet), I won't be able to comment on these option at this time.I highly recommend the Etekcity repeater because of its ease of setup/use and performance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DF0AB542FN63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3S7YFM#wasThisHelpful","R1DF0AB542FN63","A4SJSQTL0P6KI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SJSQTL0P6KI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is what I describe as an ""I-want-to-live-inside-it"" book. It's unhurried (but not slow), almost like the author is giving you a teaspoon to eat a dessert that they know youre going to want to savor.And I did. I LOVED this book.One reader online (I think there's a total of two short blurbs in all of cyberspace) suggested that this book was only for seasoned Warwick Deeping fans. But I would disagree. It IS wordy, but most readers who enjoy old fashioned storytelling won't have a problem with this. Of course, if you are a WD fan (as I am) it's just pure heaven.Basically, a wild young man of ease has one too many drunken sprees and ends up spending a year or two in prison. On release, he has one night of ""the good ol days"" and wakes up with self hate and remorse. Lacking purpose, he travels the continent and eventually finds a measure of peace connecting with nature in a forest, where he builds a cabin with his own hands.His nearest neighbors are a farming family, a deaf man of all trades, and a struggling author, his tubercular wife and a capable daughter who eventually becomes a love interest.But this isn't simply a love story, sub plots are money grabbing land owners, Roman ruins, treasure, sabotage, suicide etc.A wonderful story and a new favorite for my pile.CONTENT:PROFANITY: D'sVIOLENCE: A few fist fightsMY RATING: G","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R168S6V3Q5XQBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ELGOBE#wasThisHelpful","R168S6V3Q5XQBQ","A2CO4LGCFM8TH1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CO4LGCFM8TH1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 StarsJ.J. Pope is a little man with a rather large head, presumably to keep his brains in, since he's very clever. Described almost as a dwarf, with ""infantile"" legs, he is nicknamed ""Tadpole"" in boarding school. (I found this a little odd, because twice J.J's height is mentioned at 5'2"" and although today this would definitely be considered short I would hardly call it freakish or infantile) Mercilessly bullied, J.J eventually qualifies as a medical doctor but prejudice and bullying lingers...In time, J.J. finds the love of his life, Kitty, and they set up home and practice in a smaller town outside London. But J.J. is torn between his love for scientific research and his practice (which he finds is not his niche afterall). When a spiffy new doctor sets up shop directly across the street, J.J.'s business nosedives even further, and Kitty's diagnosis of consumption is the catalyst for a change.J.J. turns in his medical license (one is not allowed to practice medicine with any kind of advertisement; and developing ones own medicine is considered quackery) and pours his soul into medical research...Like most Deeping stories, this has a ""good conquers all"" theme with a happy ending. But be warned, it does take a while to get there. Deeping really lets fly both barrels against society's prejudice, beaurocrosy, and smallmindedness and overall there's a slightly dark feel to this book.

(I found this a little odd, because twice J.J's height is mentioned at 5'2"" and although today this would definitely be considered short I would hardly call it freakish or infantile) Mercilessly bullied, J.J eventually qualifies as a medical doctor but prejudice and bullying lingers...In time, J.J. finds the love of his life, Kitty, and they set up home and practice in a smaller town outside London. But J.J. is torn between his love for scientific research and his practice (which he finds is not his niche afterall). When a spiffy new doctor sets up shop directly across the street, J.J.'s business nosedives even further, and Kitty's diagnosis of consumption is the catalyst for a change.J.J. turns in his medical license (one is not allowed to practice medicine with any kind of advertisement; and developing ones own medicine is considered quackery) and pours his soul into medical research...Like most Deeping stories, this has a ""good conquers all"" theme with a happy ending. But be warned, it does take a while to get there. Deeping really lets fly both barrels against society's prejudice, beaurocrosy, and smallmindedness and overall there's a slightly dark feel to this book. Still worth a read, but it probably won't make one of my top favorites.CONTENT: G","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R277S62SA41T36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N56XHK6#wasThisHelpful","R277S62SA41T36","A2CO4LGCFM8TH1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CO4LGCFM8TH1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The title ""Moths"" is allegorical for Society's women, who either spend their lives munching on ermine and gravitating to flames of corruption, or, as so rarely happens that it's notable when it does, rising to the stars in innocence and purity.Vere grew up with her grandmother in the wholesome English air. But when she reached the age of 16, she was sent to the Riviera to live with her mother, Lady Dolly, a well liked but ammoral dame of Society. Having Vere under her roof is a thorn in Dolly's side, making her feel old; and Vere's solemn eyes and disapproving demeanor cramp Dolly's spontaneous frivolity. So on the advice of her shallow friends, Lady Dolly decides to get Vere wedded as soon as possible.She, in effect, sells Vere off in marriage to the highest bidder; a cruel, selfish, loose-living but immensely rich Russian Count.

"So in ""Our Emily"", book 2 in the Adams family chronicles, we have the kids all pretty much grown up.Boots is back from the war, married and making due with his disability until an operation hopefully gives him his freedom back.Ned and Lizzy are building a family, Tommy trying to find work in a depressed economy and Sammy making a killing in his various business ventures. Emily is still very much Emily, excelling in her workplace but feeling a failure as a wife.The title is a bit of a misnomer as the book dwells equally as much on Sammy and his enterprises (and possible romance) as it does on Emily and Boots. (In fact, the cover picture is of Susie, not Emily at all, although they got the hair color wrong)I found this book weaker than the the first one (Down Lambeth Way). It seemed to rely too heavily on cheeky banter/ flirting than real happenings and some of the humor was rather off color. I especially didn't like the flirting carried on by married individuals to those not their mates.It is still a good story but some bits were disappointing to me.CONTENT:SEX: A few brief, non-explicit-but-still-tmi-moments, (may not be appropriate for young readers); some off color humor and innuendos, frank talk about making love, conception/ contraception, as well as illegitimacy and sowing wild oats.VIOLENCE: A few get beat up (not described blow for blow)PROFANITY: G, JC, B'sMY RATING: PG-13 (for sexual content)","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H1QZ6FZAKUIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OYFYVC#wasThisHelpful","R3H1QZ6FZAKUIV","A2CO4LGCFM8TH1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CO4LGCFM8TH1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Down Lambeth Way"" is the first book in a 29 book series of the Adams saga. The covers in the series look YA but they're really not. By that, I don't mean to say they're neccesarily inappropriate, but it depends on the age of the reader, some subject matter may be a little mature or intense for very young readers. (I'll explain in the content section below).I think first books in a series are very much like pilot episodes on TV. Some time is by neccesity taken up in the introduction of characters, setting the scenes, the backgrounds, the personalities etc. For the first 80-100 pages you might just assume its a cheeky cockney YA story with lots of playful characters but not much substance. But its so much more. Just give it time.In this series, we start with a cockney family, fatherless since the Boer war, a mother who makes due with the help of ""Uncle"" (the pawn broker) and her enterprising children. When the story begins, the children are quite young, the oldest being 14 or 15, but over the course of the book, about five years elapse and everyone is forced to grow up.The first serious thing (well, aside from getting head lice) that the family experiences, is a murder in the neighborhood, and their good friend and neighbor is being tried. There is a court trial with several characters being cross examined.Around the same time, war is declared and we experience the reality of life on the front as well as its aftermath.Between that there is love, courtship, marriage, political intrigue, and plenty of tea and cockney humor.I always love Mary Jane Staples books (aka Robert Tyler Stevens), he manages to combine just the right amount of serious subject matter with humor and action to keep me engrossed page after page and leaving me with a warm fuzzy feeling. I don't understand why his books never really ""made it"" in the US but I'm happy they can still be found through online sites.CONTENT:SEX: Fade to black, mentioned frankly but not explicitly [ for example, one character is taught the ""mysteries "" by a female ambulance driver on the front. There is also frequent mention of underclothing and particularly breasts being either firm, pouty, perky, overflowing, soft as pillows, nipples showing through, as well as one touch and some cheeky innuendo ]VIOLENCE: War time violence, nothing gory but people are injured. A woman is murdered.PROFANITY: Some, mostly British in natureMY RATING: Strong PG","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EOKXEZNA8FCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005I4DAKK#wasThisHelpful","R3EOKXEZNA8FCD","A2CO4LGCFM8TH1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CO4LGCFM8TH1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think all men should read a Love Inspired romance. You know, just so they know what they're up against. 6'4"", rippling muscles, strong, broad shoulders, dreamy golden brown eyes and wavy hair that curls oh so playfully around ones fingers and lays Adonis-like on a sculpted neck. Are you sighing, yet? Well get a grip! This is love INSPIRED and we're not here to focus on the 'outer man' so shake it off. Real women need to understand that our heroes are not only gorgeous lumps of mortal clay but also protectors of feminine virtue, intuitive, caring, kind and reassuring, all things and everything, and just what a slim-waisted woman needs them to be... ""You look tired, Sunshine. Let me rub your shoulders. And by the way, I've fixed us a picnic. Lets go mosey down by the river and eat some chicken wings under the stars...""AHHHHAHAHAHA!! :DBut kidding aside, I'm really not poking fun. I did enjoy this in my own way. I had just finished a rather serious, dark book and wanted a light palate cleanser and these little romances always do it for me. Clean, sweet, not too demanding, perfect for in-between chunksters.I wont go into the plot (you can see that on the blurb) but I did find it interesting that our hero here is blind. Something like that grabs my attention, the ""I'm standing by the underdog"" gene, I guess. I want our hero to mount up with wings and conquer all. Blind. With both arms tied around his back, hornets circling and one leg in quicksand. Catherine Cookson, where are you?CONTENT: PGSEX: None shown but rape is mentionedVIOLENCE: A couple of fights, a near rape and shooting. One or two instances of traumatic death.PROFANITY: NonePREACHINESS LEVEL: Pretty mild.

"After spending some years in prison for manslaughter, John Hallifax disappears. The next news of him is a letter received by his wife, postmarked from Paris, telling of John's death from consumption.Rachel remarries for so-called stability, this time to a wealthy philisoper, a ""secretary bird with trousers""; a passionless man in love with only himself and the applauds of society.Meanwhile, a rough, Esau-like man calling himself John Bamfield has taken lodgings in a slum area of London named ""Paradise Place"" and has tacked up his shingle as an herbalist. He's a hairy, bearded man of the earth, ready with his fists, quick with his wits, and carrying a secret about him...I loved this. I haven't had the pleasure of a hero like this in some time and I warmed to the ""tough softie""; he's stubborn but completely unselfish and very human. Rachel also felt very real, she was sad, she was happy, she was conniving and I rooted for her.The ending is satisfying and no part of the story lags.

"This is so very different from H.V. Stacpoole's ""Beach of Dreams"" and ""The Man Who Lost Himself"" that it took me several chapters to get my bearings and understand just what I held in my hands. I think I know now.""Patsy"" is an Irish comedy. And just so you know, Patsy is not a girl but a boy; a rather enterprising, cheeky, very Irish boy. The language is in the vernacular but just enough to be humorous and not so heavy as to be unreadable.Ok so the plot...well, at its heart we have a lovelorn couple thwarted in love. The man's uncle disapproves of the match and has arranged a more ""suitable"" suitor for his ward; a man with money (but alas very tight), much older, no sense of humor and a glass eye. Yes, you heard right. A glass eye. And remember this book is a comedy soooo can we just say that things happen with regard to said glass eye.And then there's Patsy who has just landed a job in the big house as a sort of ""fetch and carry"" boy. As was mentioned he's a bit of a Cheeky Charlie with extras. In this case, the extras involve a bandit uncle who is the terror of the countryside along with his accomplice. The baddies have got wind that there's people of ""quality"" staying at the great house and they smell money. A break-in is arranged...and a trap is set. The results are zany and unpredictable.I think this could be a 5 star book depending on the audience. I went into it having no idea what it was about and it was entertaining but not one I'd probably reread. However if I had read it when I was a young adult, I would have loved it to pieces.

"4.5 StarsThis author is amazing. ""Beach Of Dreams"" is my second book by Stacpoole (the first being ""The Man Who Lost Himself"") and it is very, very good. Don't let the title mislead you. This isn't some kind of island holiday where romance ensues while people sun themselves and drink tequilas. Thank goodness!Two ships collide, a steam yacht and a full sail fishing vessel. They sink, not too far from a particularly hostile group of islands with basalt cliffs, caves, bitumen pits and sea elephants. Only a few survive, a wealthy lady and two rough sailors. After some unfortunate events, the lady ends up fighting the elements on her own.When hope seems farthest away, an illiterate, burly, red bearded fisherman is washed ashore...And I don't dare say any more for fear of spoiling things, but it gets VERY exciting, and the author's ability to evoke a place with all its wonders and dangers is unparalleled.Its unfortunate that Henry De Vere Stacpoole's works are so scarce. You can find a few overpriced print on demand paperbacks but only his more famous books. Thankfully, many are available on public domain sites for free download. Yay!CONTENT: PGBrief violence, and a few racially derrogative comments directed at the chinese.

"I read Signa and Bebee and enjoyed them immensely. This story just didn't work for me. The overall tone is so depressing it makes Les Miserables or Tess of the D'Urbervilles feel like Pollyanna.I don't mind some darkness if there's a glimmer of hope, but this isn't that kind of story. I counted one sympathetic character, a cripple and outcast who dies soon after his introduction. Other than him, they are to the last man, woman and child either downright evil or soul-destroyingly indifferent.I'm the first to admit that understanding allegory is not my strong suite. And this book is rich with them. To a more intellectual mind, I can imagine its worth. But unfortunately, I was blinded by the misery. If there was a moral to this, the only two I took home were that ""evil always conquers good"" and ""there is no God but gold"". Not very cheerful.In a nutshell: a fatherless child (read: spawn of the devil) is brought up as a slave to her evil grandfather and abused by him and every other person she meets. She eventually comes upon a painter starving to death in a tower and comes to his aid. She falls in love with him but he is only in love with his art...I have a Goodreads friend who adores this book (Its his favorite Ouida) and I'm so reluctant to say anything against it. But my fragile emotions couldn't handle this.

He must take the ship to Panda, on the African coast to collect goods...and... he must take a passenger, a woman, who is attempting to track down her runaway husband who abandoned her seven years prior, and her young daughter.For the first half of the book, FBY had me by the ears. I enjoyed seeing relationships develop on board with the various sailors, seeing how a young child changed these gruff men into more human creatures, also the jealousy and animosity between them, having a woman about.Where FBY lost me was when we stepped ashore in Africa. The descriptions were...how can I put it? I couldn't SEE what he was describing. For example, there is a storm, a tornado, an escape through estuaries or swamps (I'm still not quite sure) and at these times I couldn't really picture what was happening.There's also some loose ends which were never fully explained*SPOILER* There is a rather mysterious man of business who resides in his mosquito netted four posted bed. He looks like a marble statue and we're given to understand that he is partially paralyzed. Our hero has a few conversations with him. Later it is said that this mysterious man has died. And that he died a week prior. But our hero was in communication with him during this time. How? Was someone using him like a dummy? It's never explained. And why did everyone hate him so much? What did he do? Also, what happens to the woman's husband? There is a fight at the end and we don't know if he is alive or dead. Is our heroine free to marry again? We don't know. *END OF SPOILER*I would be interested in hearing someone else's thoughts on this one but being that it is somewhat rare I may need to wait a while...CONTENT: PGSEX: One offscreen attack/ rapeVIOLENCE: Some violence but not very descriptive.PROFANITY: D's mostly.

"So tell me about myself, that's always fun :) As long as its praiseworthy, complimentary, gushworthy, flattering and otherwise ego boosting, right? No one wants to find out they're a closeted psychopath, egocentric cleptomaniac or some other blight on society. That just wouldn't be cool.So it was with tingling anticipation I picked up this book. See, I used to have exemplary writing. I did. It was a practiced ART. Perfect. I was proud of it. Then, over time....I don't know. I guess it just wasn't that important to me anymore and I let it go the way of the wind and let my writing just happen. So now...what can I say?  I DARE you to steal my recipe book!This was fun and instructive- very good for highschoolers or others looking for their niche in the career world. Its not all encompassing,  (there are other books that go deeper into criminal/business analysis etc.) but is a basic guide with graphs,examples and plenty of simple explanations to help you unlock your potentials and give you a springboard for job ideas.

"4.5 StarsThis is a wonderful story about a penniless American man who accidently meets his double in a crowded Hotel lounge. His lookalike ""liquors him up"" and the next thing he knows he is waking up in a posh bedroom and being called the Earl of Rochester.At first he thinks its a practical joke and he plays along. But when the morning newspaper arrives, it all becomes clear: 'Mr Jones, the American' (the real Mr. Rochester) has commited suicide...You have to love Vincent Jones. A down to earth, honest, plucky businessman, he sorts out the messes Mr. Rochester left behind him one by one, some with truly funny climaxes. All could have carried on smoothly but then the new Mr Rochester meets the lovely woman who he is ""married"" to and falls in love...What follows is a confession, a lunatic asylum and a great escape.So this was really good. There is no part of the story that lagged at all and I really felt invested in the characters.

"3.5 StarsWhich is the greater of two evils...a man who abuses his wife over the course of many years, or a woman who kills such a man in self defense? Laws being what they were in 1930s England, such a woman would either hang or spend the rest of her life in prison.But what if someone.... (theoretically speaking), spirits such a woman away, hides her, creates a new identity for her, a new life somewhere far away...on the continent perhaps, is that man an even greater sinner? Should he be held with even greater responsibility or is it perhaps true that ""the law is an ass"", afterall?Such is the conundrum for Mr. Luce, a widower, who leases an old signal tower in the country for peace and quiet and then one stormy night hears a tapping at his door...So I enjoyed this book, Deeping always delivers a well told story, but it wasn't my favorite of his. I thought there was a lot of room to spare for richer and more authentic character development, especially on the part of the woman. I felt that Rachel (the abused wife) realistically would have had a lot more baggage/ trust issues than she was shown with and probably wouldn't have fallen so quickly into another man's protection (or his arms).

"This book is roughly 70% travelogue, 20% mystery and 10% romance.(and the romance is split between four couples)It felt almost as though the author kept a diary while on an extensive trip to Egypt and decided to use it as a base for a novel. The descriptions are vivid but I admit I got a little impatient after a while because the story was kept waiting while we admired the scenery. (And anyone who knows me knows that I enjoy a leisurely-paced, descriptive book so go figure...)I think if it had been edited by about 100 pages the story would have been ""tightened up "" improving it. But it was an ok read and quite interesting. There are one or two exciting bits but overall not very suspenseful.Aside from the scenic descriptions and history of Egyptian gods, we have a story of hidden treasure, escape from a harem and espionage.I would recommend it to those who enjoy a more rambling mystery and exotic vacation thrown in.MY RATING: G","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB4E1JFLXTEUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00847OS2M#wasThisHelpful","RB4E1JFLXTEUH","A2CO4LGCFM8TH1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CO4LGCFM8TH1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"2.5 StarsWhen a down-on-his-luck man comes across a dead acquaintance in the wilds of Australia, it doesn't seem such a big deal to go through his possessions and see what might be of use. One item is a deed to a piece of land. To claim it: pretend to be the owner.At first the land is a disappointment. Nothing will grow in the black dust and the man is becoming desperate, only to find he is sitting on...a tin mine.'Jasper Vellacot' is now a millionaire philanthropist and his ""Midas Touch"" has accelerated. Everything he touches seems to turn to gold in his hands. And while he is accomplishing much good with his wealth, his secret is eating away at him and keeping him from making close friendships, especially a friendship with a certain beautiful woman who claims cousinship with him.Then one day a man arrives on his doorstep. A ne'er do well, rough looking, heavy drinking man who looks an awful lot like the acquaintance he left for dead....So it sounds good but this is probably my least favorite WJL. He got a little sidetracked with the main theme and I found some of the secondary characters more interesting than the primary ones, especially the poet ""Bon Ami"" and his passionate love for an Italian peasant girl (and subsequent action in WW1)In this story his main character, Jasper, becomes a politician (as several of his characters in previous books have done) and I felt a sort of dejavu while reading.An ok read but only for WJL fans.CONTENT: G","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DC2OKNMQCUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BA5WEQ#wasThisHelpful","R24DC2OKNMQCUG","A2CO4LGCFM8TH1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CO4LGCFM8TH1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Simon de Gex, wealthy and successful MP, finds he has six months to live, he embarks on a quest for ""eumoiriety"".In the words of Marcus Aurelius, "" Let death surprise me when or where it will, I may be eumoiros, or a happy man, nevertheless. For he is a happy man who in his lifetime dealeth unto himself a happy lot and portion...in good desires, good actions.""So in the matter of a few months, Simon disposes of his wealth in handouts, charities, in hefty tips etc. After all, what good is money when you're six feet under? If Simon can ""fix "" the universal woes by dipping into his pockets then by all means live, laugh and be eumoirous!But doctors can be wrong, one can meddle where one is not desired, and what does one do when there is a return from the grave but its a return to a bleak world? No money. No society friends. No real skills. No desire? It is a quest for eumoiriety all over again. But this time, perhaps this time, Simon returns a wiser man...I really liked this. What Ive summarized seems pretty straightforward and tame, but there are a lot of twists and turns along the way and interesting characters to spice things up.

But the story is contemporary (1960s) and doesn't have Daphne Du Maurier's depth or the Gothic atmosphere that the MMP cover suggests.A young woman marries a widower (his wife died in plane crash that also badly injured him) and his daughter suddenly starts insisting that she's ""seen mommy"" and even had cakes with her.

"I always enjoy stories that turn the table on cliche, convention and cardboard cutouts.In Septimus we find a delightfully unusual hero who is modest, inconsequential in appearance, flighty, untidy, eccentric, and inventive. Mainly, he's inventive in developing complicated weaponry, which is pretty ironic when you get to know what a tender-hearted, self sacrificing person Septimus really is, (and you will eventually learn why he chose that trade) but it does send the point home that you can never judge by appearances.When I first meet Septimus in chapter one I felt a moment of dismay. ""Oh please don't tell me this bumbling idiot is going to be the hero..."". See how we judge on first sight? I'm ashamed of myself. But I soon found myself rooting for him and you will too.I could have done with less of Clem Sypher, the inventer of ""Sypher's Cure"" and more of Septimus though. Clem at times dominated the story, he was larger than life, and while I understood why he was there (to serve as contrast) and although I do feel that he was neccesary, he hogged.Still a 4 Star read for me and is free on public domain.MY RATING: G","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ESXTSWBMWV1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500786063#wasThisHelpful","R2ESXTSWBMWV1A","A2CO4LGCFM8TH1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CO4LGCFM8TH1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This reminded me of a male Cinderella story. At its outset we meet Paul, an unloved and unwanted child in Lancashire. He sleeps on the scullery floor at night and is beaten whenever his mother and stepfather over imbibe (which is most of the time). This would normally break a child's spirit but Paul is of a different nature entirely. For one he is an egoist; there's really no other word for it.Instead of accepting the inevitable drudge of factory work and home misery as his fate, he sees great things for himself and is convinced that he is the descendant of a Prince. (Why else would he look and act so differently from his family?) So he decides to run away and become what he always knew himself to be: Great.And he does. He goes from modeling in art studios (he's Adonis in the flesh), to trying his hand at acting, to bankruptcy, pneumonia and dying under a bush, and eventually discovering his fairy godmother and a path to politics and success.And that's where he lost me... I'm not at all into politics and I would have found the story much more interesting if he made his fortune frying fish rather than waving the flag. That's just me.But there are some interesting twists and turns in the story especially with regard to his real father's identity and a French princess.A solid 3 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QL6H5Y8VZGV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082YSBLG#wasThisHelpful","R1QL6H5Y8VZGV9","A2CO4LGCFM8TH1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CO4LGCFM8TH1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It somehow doesn't seem right to review a book that's really only half a book (The ""sequel"" Capitola's Peril is the other half, and both are available free on kindle).Well, I didn't love this. I'm not even sure if I liked it. It's a strange little book and has its share of devoted fans but for one reason or another IT and I just didn't 'click '. Some books are like that and you can't force the relationship. It either is or it isnt.At its beginning, ""The Hidden Hand "" is a mystery. Then its a comedy. Then a romance, next a sermon and then...it ends. No character felt real enough for me to care what became of them. And primarily for this reason, although the book takes us to a cliffhanger ending where nothing much is resolved and Black Donald is still on the loose, I'm ok with that. I know the answers are all in the sequel but I'm not sure I'm that bothered to find out, even though its free.

"4.5 StarsWhat happens when a gentleman of learning, passion, and artistic temperament gets his heart broken? Why, he smashes every remnant of his past life into little tiny fragments, sweeps them under the rug of oblivion and reimerges with a new identity.

If this sounds like your style, I think you'll find Beloved Vagabond a very satisfying read that celebrates true contentment found in the obvious yet elusive real life.In The Beloved Vagabond one learns (almost too late) that dreams, even admirable dreams, lifelong dreams, lovelorn dreams, are occasionally best kept under the pillow where dreams belong.CONTENT: G-PG (for ""crapulous"" i.e, drunken, scenes :)*I recommend reading this for free via Amazon on an ereader or tablet with built in dictionary/ translation features for fullest enjoyment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27B6LNZPL5E3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UJURUA#wasThisHelpful","R27B6LNZPL5E3U","A2CO4LGCFM8TH1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CO4LGCFM8TH1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Five stars easy!A Woman's War is my first Warwick Deeping and I've happily found a new favorite author. :)In a nutshell, it is a story of good triumphing over evil. The evil in this case comes in the form of inherited alcoholism. A curse for any person but particularly more stigmatic (and potentially dangerous) when one is an M.D. in a small village. Neighbors will talk, jealous coworkers will scheme and accidents will happen...This story engrossed me from page one. Dr. James Murchison and his family warmed my heart with their deep seated love/ support for eachother. When James stumbles, we root for him, willing him to overcome his ""curse "" before all is lost. And when good eventually triumphs and the baddies get their just desserts we try not to revel in it, because we've experienced what that feels like.A wholesome, must read, honest book. How it ever went out of print I don't know. Thankfully, it can be read or downloaded straight from public domain sites such as Openlibrary.https://openlibrary.org/works/OL12134...Or, there are a few publishing houses like Dodo Press offering new copies for pretty steep prices.CONTENT:SEX: NoneVIOLENCE: NonePROFANITY: Mild.

"Ive been the proud owner of the original kindle fire for about three years. As a tablet, its great. But I really love to READ and my issue with the Fire was bugged out eyes even using minimal lighting. So for some time I pored over the kindle ereader reviews and when Amazon sent me a special offer on the new $79 kindle I took the plunge.BOTTOM LINE: I love it!I love the screen which doesn't even look like a screen but  more like  newspaper (I actually gave it a little tap when I took it out of its box to see if it was a screen or a sticker). Also, I read a lot of old books which are sometimes full of now forgotten English words and French phrases, and with the ""vocabulary builder ' feature I can look up, translate from several languages into English, highlight, store new words in flashcards etc. I can also send a quote to my Goodreads feed which is pretty neat. And I can read for hours and my eyes are happy. No there's no lighted screen but that appealed to me as I don't often read in the dark anyway. For me, no backlight means no buggy eyes.I have used the ""experimental browser "" and its not too shabby. I was able to download MOBI files from other sources and they open just fine on the home screen. I can also organize my books, magazines and documents into collections which was never an option on the kindle tablets, so I'm thrilled about that.And it's light! Half the weight of my Kindle Fire so no more ""Kindle elbow "".I know the battery wont last weeks for me because I read more than 30 minutes a day but even if it lasts for a few days (rather than a few hours) it will be awesome.Why 4 Stars? Well, I'm not crazy about the ""page blinking "" when you scroll down a list of books. I don't know why that couldn't have been cleaned up since the tablets don't do that. Its my first ereader so maybe this is common, I don't know, but its annoying.But I love this, its very reasonably priced and I keep finding new features to love.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5ZAYLFYLOU9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I15SB16#wasThisHelpful","R5ZAYLFYLOU9U","A2CO4LGCFM8TH1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CO4LGCFM8TH1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 StarsThis is a retelling of Marie Belloc Lowndes' book The Lodger but with a humorous cockney twist. While characters go about their daily routines and see to their own joys and challenges, a murderer is afoot. A murderer who strangles his lady victims and takes a lock of their golden hair as a souvenir.No, the murders are not funny. But this is where Mary Jane Staples (a.k.a. Robert Tyler Stevens) excels at his craft. The way he can take a subject like Jack the Ripper and turn it into a feel good story is masterful. In this novel we are treated to three distinct romances, a lot of cockney humor and bantering dialog as well as satisfying suspense.It's a light read but there's still enough going on to satisfy serious readers who like a meatier story.

"3.5 StarsWe're first introduced to Lebanon as a young bayou woman living with her father, Crease and brother Joel. Her mother died while Lebanon was very small so her upbringing was left to the menfolk. So it's not too surprising that Lebanon is just as comfortable hunting alligators as she is in keeping house. While she never learned to read and write, (not for lack of desire) she is well seasoned in survival skills.I loved the bayou part of the book, I always find that setting fascinating and her first love with Sebastian Ratcliff was soul satisfyingly sweet. They really seemed like soulmates. Unfortunately, Sebastian is betrothed to another and stands by his word...Lebanon, alone with her misery, can no longer bear her memories in the bayou so she impetuously proposes to a family friend in order to head West.We're not actually told where they end up settling and if you're looking for much in the way of wagon trails, river crossings and Indian attacks you'll be disappointed (I was not) as the story doesn't dwell on the journey, but rather the destination.Lebanon is made for homesteading while her husband is not. Partly for this reason and partly because they're very different from eachother there are some serious ups and downs in their married life.I wont go further because I will spoil things but there is a twist toward the end which is quite surprising. And while some might say it has a possible HEA, the story did not end as I wanted it to and I frowned as I closed the book, which took it down a star for me.Overall, a good read.CONTENT:SEX: NoneVIOLENCE : Mild (view spoiler)PROFANITY: Very mild, BMY RATING: PG* NOTE* There's a paragraph in this book where Lebanon talks of a home remedy for preventing poison ivy blisters: chewing the leaves. I looked it up to see if that really works. It is NOT recommended and serious reactions may occur. Apparently, the thought was to chew very small amounts, (much the way homeopathy works), gradually increasing the dose. But there's no proof that this helps and could be dangerous so is best avoided.

"3.5 Stars (Mary Stewart Group Read Sept 2014)Well I started this a week earlier than I should have (got the dates mixed up) so I'm reviewing when I should just be starting to read. Nevermind. It happens.I won't write a synopsis, that's been done many times. I'll just say that I enjoyed this, thought it was well written and was fairly gripping toward the end.I liked the retro references to gold lipstick and nylon clothes which made me think of 60s films (gotta love em! ) and the dolphin was a nice touch too. Cigarette smoking was kept pretty much in its place in this one (MS characters are often chain smokers) which I found refreshing, although they do still smoke. Just not OTT. I thought that the h/h had fairly good chemistry but I would have enjoyed seeing them interact together a bit more.I cant say I was steamrolled, though, by the plot. I could guess what was coming so unfortunately that curbed the suspense a bit. I would rate it about equal to Mary Stewart's The Moonspinners.

"**NOTE:  I own this series on dvd: Edwardian Farm As of yet, it is the only one of the BBC ""Farm"" series released on NTSC/Region 1 dvd.**First off, this is not the first ""Farm"" series the BBC has done with these 3 historians. This is actually the 3'd in a whole unique series!If you're interested in going in order, I urge you to check out ""Tales From The Green Valley"" (set in the 1620's), *& mini companion ""A Tudor Feast"" (1500/1600 at Haddon Hall), Victorian Farm *& supplementary companion: Victorian Pharmacy starring Ruth Goodman*. There is also 2 more series after ""Edwardian Farm"". ""Wartime Farm"" (WWII era), and ""Tudor Monastery Farm"" (w/ Ruth, Peter, and Tom *who replaces Alex*).If you enjoyed the first and the last of the ""Farm"" series, you might also also enjoy BBC's latest historical docu-reality series-- ""Secrets of the Castle"" (w/ Ruth, Peter, and Tom). A 5 episode series (spanning 6 months). Set in France at Gu√©delon Castle, an ongoing 25 year project is still underway with many expert archaeologists and builders recreating an authentic 13th century castle fortification.**My hats off to the BBC for creating such a fascinating, and informative historical reality series!Truthfully there's hardly anything to compare it to in the US. PBS has aired 3 (US filmed) series of this genre a few years back from three different periods: ""Colonial House"" (1620's), ""Frontier House"" (1880's), and ""Texas Ranch House"" (late 1860's). While good in themselves, I've much preferred ones produced by the BBC.The farm series takes you a whole year into every aspect of farm life at the time. Utilizing modern technology/tools along the way. They have various extra historians, and experts of certain fields as guests too. You learn so much about a person's daily of the era, that it's as if you're transported back in time! There's animal husbandry, gardening, homemade remedies, recipes; even the origin of certain sayings, and other educational tidbits! The historians are super informative, and I applaud them for taking such time and effort to really learn all aspects of the time period they're delving into.In conclusion, if you love history, and wonder what it was really like to live in the past-- I highly recommend this documentary miniseries, and again, all the rest that I mentioned above!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10AP5KBRX5T9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013VXURL4#wasThisHelpful","R10AP5KBRX5T9","A23KZBVCFKW1XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23KZBVCFKW1XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm on my second time of viewing this series (since I initially bought the complete set back in 2009/10).  I appreciate that it's free to stream with my PRIME membership, and even better since it offers captions/subtitles which my dvd's do not.Just today I learned something I didn't know before.  I was reading a topic on the ""Dr. Quinn"" IMDB page, and a fan mentioned that, the order in which the episodes were filmed, is NOT the order that they were aired.  Because of that, there's a continuity issue (events out of order).If you want to view it in the correct order, check out the episode guide (and scroll to the bottom of page): drquinnmd.com/library/episodes1.htmlAs for this show, I love period pieces, and I like the fact that this is pretty much PG rated.  It's becoming increasingly harder to find a period/historical drama with this level of rating, as so many are opting for whatever is shocking, violent, and immoral/raunchy.While ""DQMW"" tackles some tough issues of the post civil war era, it helps the viewers see them as a sort of abject lesson.It's worth bearing in mind, that the real people and events sometimes portrayed (such as in season 3), are not always accurately depicted.Of course, this isn't meant to be a historical documentary, and as with many other historically based dramas, artistic license comes into play.If you're looking for something similar to watch, I recommend ""Christy"" (19 ep's), ""When Calls the Heart"" (ongoing Hallmark series-- 2 seasons & counting), ""Road to Avonlea"" (7 seasons), and ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" (4 seasons).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R282MMLPA8RV2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007K0EIKQ#wasThisHelpful","R282MMLPA8RV2I","A23KZBVCFKW1XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23KZBVCFKW1XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**EDIT:  Since watching this a second time, I've slightly edited my rating & review.**Period/costume dramas are my favorite genre, and I've enjoyed some of Ms. Mulligan's prior performances (P&P 05, Bleak House, Northanger Abbey).Admittedly I haven't read the book yet, but I am familiar with the story.  I've watched the 1998 BBC miniseries twice **Starring Paloma Baeza, Nathaniel Parker (Gabriel Oak), Jonathan Firth (Sgt. Troy), and Nigel Terry (Mr. Boldwood)**.Probably the biggest problem that a book with 58 chapters faces, is being condensed into a movie format/time frame.  In most cases, books of this length are better left to a miniseries length.  This story is no exception!I'm curious to know from an actual reader's standpoint, if this format of ""FftMC"" fits all their expectations?Just in comparison to the 4 pt. miniseries, there were bits of story and characters that were left out in this.  And some of the character interaction wasn't given enough time (such as with Fanny & Sgt. Troy).Because of rushed timeline, I felt a bit disconnected from the leads at times.  Bathsheba, seems a little more wise and worldly than she should.  The best I can describe is she's a bit like Lydia Bennet (Pride & Prejudice), and Becky Sharp (Vanity Fair).  Sgt. Troy is very much like Mr. Wickham (Pride & Prejudice), and Rawdon Crawley (Vanity Fair).As for the other two leads-- Mr. Oak, and Mr. Boldwood (or a more fitting comparison-- her loyal sheepdog, and a lamb being lead to the slaughter); if only they could move on to someone more deserving!  For 2 of the 3 men, things end badly.The biggest positive this movie has over the miniseries is the ending.  The miniseries was so underwhelming in that respect, building up almost 4 hours, to not even one peck between them!  (Although if we're going to get technical, the mini seems in line with the end chapter: www.online-literature.com/hardy/madding/58/ ).Major props to the costume designer!  I counted around 30 different costumes for Ms. Mulligan herself.  I don't think I've ever noticed that many different outfits in a period movie for 1 lead.  My best guess for this, was that her clothes were an extension of her character-- namely her vanity.The cinematography, scenery, and locations, were also top notch!Overall, I was left with an impression, rather than a clearly defined and detailed glimpse of the story.While I do think there could have been some improvements, and added length, I can  recommend this for those that like period dramas in general.  But advise those acquainted with the book- it may be a bit disappointing.If you're looking for a more detailed adaptiation, check out the '98:  imdb.com/title/tt0157616/If you want to know more about life (and farming) in the Victorian era, I recommend the BBC docu-series ""Victorian Farm"":tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BBCHistoricalFarmSeries","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PK3ZVP9DOJRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011PXGR1Q#wasThisHelpful","R3PK3ZVP9DOJRB","A23KZBVCFKW1XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23KZBVCFKW1XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me preface this by saying that I have read the book, and have seen 2 other adaptations-- the 1981 mini, and the 1995 movie.While I think this production fitting of 5 stars, there are a couple of things I didn't like:**Semi Spoiler**: Mr. Davies took it upon himself to show the viewers in the opening seconds of the film- a glimpse of Willoughby in his ""Libertine"" ways (around 9-10 months prior to his Allenham visit). While background information in some films can be a great help, in this case I think it was a BIG mistake!!  In my opinion we lose the whole shock of finding it out along with Elinor and Marianne (much later in the book)!!Who on earth picked Dominic Cooper as Willoughby?! ..Miss Austen describes him as ""uncommonly handsome.."" who possessed ""manly beauty and more than common gracefulness"".I realize this is a personal opinion; and others might feel otherwise, but in my opinion Mr. Cooper possesses neither!To the ""handsome"" part- he doesn't hold a candle to Greg Wise (Willoughby '95), nor to the Edward Ferrars (Dan Stevens) in the new version! I have to say, that for me- their eyes are one of the first things I notice- and his eyes in no way entice me!! Ironically, Mr. Davies steals Mr. Darcy's ""fine eyes"" line (from Pride & Prejudice) and inserts this as one of Marianne's lines (after her 1st encounter with Willoughby).As for the ""more than the common gracefulness"" bit- Was it just me or did the poor chap look like he was about to have a hernia lifting Marianne?! (the grunt and gasp when he put her down didn't help either). I'm NOT implying that the actress that played Marianne was overweight; just that he's not a tall strapping fellow that can pick any woman up with ease. Which is what one would expect Mr. Willoughby to be! (An excerpt from the San Francisco Chronicle/ SFGate article entitled ""PBS airs adaptations, old and new, of all Jane Austen's novels"" states the following: 'Dominic Cooper recalled the hash he made initially of one of the novel's most romantic moments -- when his character, the ""uncommonly handsome"" Willoughby, rescues Marianne Dashwood after she slips and twists her ankle running down a hill. The torrential rain ""did make it quite difficult picking her up from a 90-degree angle on a wet, greasy, green hill and turning back to walk up the hill with a very long, wet coat on,"" Cooper recalls. ""When I kind of squatted down, the jacket got caught. I fell over immediately and put her head in a ditch."")Finally, nothing about his acting or portrayal excited me. Greg Wise will always be the perfect Willoughby to me!While Kate Winslet remains my favorite Marianne, Miss Wakefield does her character justice.While this version doesn't have the comedic relief that the '95 had (specifically in connection to Sir John Middleton and Mrs. Jennings), this version does adhere to the book in that Sir John wasn't a widower.I quite like the new Edward Ferrars (played by Dan Stevens), more so than Hugh Grant.This Col. Brandon is more of a convincing 35 yr. old than Alan Rickman was.  But his portrayal really didn't stand out more than Alan Rickman's.Elinor is also much more of a convincing 20 yr. old than Emma Thompson  (and I have to say, there are times when she sounds a lot like Emma too)!  But if I had to choose between a favorite Elinor, Hattie Moran would be it!I also like the new Mrs. Dashwood (Janet McTeer; she played lead actress in ""The Black Velvet Gown"").Thankfully Mr. Davies included in this version an important scene from the book that the '95 one omitted!  (**Spoiler Alert**: Willoughby's attempt at redemption: The conversation between Willoughby and Elinor just after he married.) He (Davies) also made a point to include the rest of the (smaller) characters in the book which the '95 left out. (**Spoiler** And to bring to life a subtle mention of a dual between Col. Brandon and Willoughby. Although it has been said that it most likely would have been a pistol draw rather than a sword fight. ...It reminded me a bit of P&P '95, in which they show Mr. Darcy working out his frustration of rejection by fencing. And I do believe that in Northanger Abbey '07 there's a dream sequence in which Miss Morland's two suitors are dueling it out with swords. I guess Mr. Davies loves sword fighting!)Of the latest Jane Austen adaptations (Persuasion, Northanger Abbey, and Mansfield Park)- Sense & Sensibility is the best out of the four! Maybe because this version is 3 hrs., whereas, the other three were 1 hr. 20 min. Or maybe due to the fact that Mr. Davies has more experience in the adaptation/reproduction department (FYI: He's the script writer for other Jane Austen works: Pride & Prejudice '95 BBC miniseries, Emma  '96 BBC movie, and Northanger Abbey '07).In conclusion, I definitely think this miniseries does the book justice; and I heartily recommend it to anyone who loves period dramas, or who are fans of Miss Austen!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ4JKYM7ZK98K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111NKVZS#wasThisHelpful","RQ4JKYM7ZK98K","A23KZBVCFKW1XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23KZBVCFKW1XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

HOWEVER, when this originally aired in the UK on ITV, there were TWO 1 hour episodes.As usual, British productions are always pared down for PBS viewing. Sadly, in this case it wasn't just a few cut scenes, but a whole hour missing!They apparently changed the narrator too, because Alan Titchmarsh was the ITV presenter.ITV's version isn't available for sale (at least on Amazon UK), so who knows when or if I'll ever get to see pt. 2.

"**Reviewers Note**While I have yet to purchase this dvd set, I have purchased the entire season 2 on Amazon Instant Video.I thought it might be important to note the manufacturers info, for those considering a purchase:  shoutfactory.com/tv/drama/when-calls-the-heart-year-two-the-television-movie-collection  For those that require Closed Caption-- this set WILL have them!The runtime, ""435 minutes"" in Amazon's product description, also seems to allow for a few extra's (roughly 42 min's per episode X 10= 420 min's; leaves roughly 15 min's for extras.FishFlix is offering a 10 disc set.  So just like last year, there will be 2 sets to confuse the fans!Right now, the preorder price is $34.99 (w/ free shipping on $35 orders).When Calls the Heart Season 2 Collectors Edition: 10 DVD Set (Fishflix Stock No : LM2423222),  Available October 13, 2015  For those requiring CC/subtitles, you will need to contact them, as there is no indication that this set contains them.  It is worth noting that the 10 disc Season 1 set did NOT have either option.**UPDATE: Season 3 has been confirmed.  There will be a 2 hour ""movie""/double episode late Dec. 2015, and 8 more episodes starting in February 2016!**____________________Now to some of my thoughts on season 2.....Producer Brian Bird described this season as a ""roller coaster"" ride, and it appears we got just that!There was definitely more drama this season than the last.  While that isn't necessarily always a bad thing, there's seems to be a delicate balance in keeping the pace moving, while retaining the charm of the previous season.Personally, I felt at times that there's simply too much going on, and not enough focus on what was important. Also, the storylines were lacking the depth of season 1.Another thing this season had more of was humor.  Last season had a serious/somber undertone, but this season has a lot of light hearted comedic relief (from an unlikely source, no less).**MINIMAL SPOILERS AHEAD**To start off...  Ep's 1 & 2 (aka ""Trials of the Heart""), gave the residents of Coal Valley the answers, AND decision they've long been waiting for!  This impacts the town in a big way, and ushers forth major changes for its future.We're also introduced to a slew of new characters; many who will be recurring in further episodes this season. In addition, the viewers are taken out of ""Coal Valley"", and introduced to Elizabeth's world in ""Hamilton"".Although the storyline had a serious undertone, it was equally infused with humor (and cute banter-- especially between Elizabeth & Jack)!Episodes 4 & 5 (aka ""3. Heart's Desire"" on Amazon) was my favorite, because the latter half of that double episode had a definite season 1 feel. But alas, the subsequent ep's took a step backwards (until the latter half of the season finale).**I was frankly baffled at Elizabeth's seemingly changed personality throughout this season.  Perhaps it's because she lost her center?**The final 2 episodes (""With All My Heart"") were my second favorite (3'd was ""Trials of the Heart"").FINALLY, things felt as if they were getting back on track!  The focus shifted back to CV/HV, forcing Jack & Elizabeth to face what had become of their relationship during the season. There were palpable moments of emotion, and honesty that we really hadn't seen since season 1. But just as things were drawing to a happy conclusion, BOOM! we're left with a cliffhanger (although one many viewers like myself saw coming).In conclusion, I felt season 2 only earned 4 stars (instead of the 5 I gave s1).  While ""WCtH"" remains one of the cleanest dramas on television; in comparison with the first-- it has a little less ""heart"".  Season 1 bore many similarities with another (short lived) favorite of mine-- ""Christy"".  In both, the teacher student interaction was at its core.  ""WCtH"" season 2 sadly fails to deliver on that end; they're nothing more than an afterthought.  And I personally feel Elizabeth's own character suffers for that!For the 3'd season, I hoping that it will go back to season one's formula: heartwarming moral lessons, positive character growth, and teacher/student interactions. Keep the ""Hamilton"" back and forths to a minimum (if at all), and ""triangles"" in the Bermuda ;)_____________As for the modern infusion to the costumes, and hairstyles (which has been more noticeable to me, being I watch a lot of period dramas-- especially of the Edwardian era.):Producer Brian Bird addressed the costumes and hair complaints in the FB group (Fans of Hallmark's When Calls The Heart)This is just part of his long comment: ""....You should also know that our patron, the Hallmark Channel, asked us to make some of these changes because their research after Season 1 indicated the audience was hoping for more romance, and less grittiness. So, as part of being good partners with our patrons (and wanting to ensure the longevity of the show as opposed to be stubborn and standing on principle) we are doing our best to address some of their hopes and dreams for the series going forward.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29E7XMGFYV6UV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0112HPUC2#wasThisHelpful","R29E7XMGFYV6UV","A23KZBVCFKW1XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23KZBVCFKW1XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Reviewer Note:  I received this product for free from Lauren Brooke Cosmetiques, in exchange for an honest review.**I bought their original formula of foundation a couple of years ago.  Now that LBC has reformulated it, I was anxious to give it a try!LBC's customer service is very helpful.  I suggested the color I had in mind, but had them decide by viewing a picture of me in good lighting.  They concurred with my choice (Neutral No. 00).  If you're having a hard time deciding, I would suggest contacting them:  laurenbrookecosmetiques.com/pages/contact-us(If you choose to contact them via their FB page, it might take them a few days longer to reply.)My skin is combo oily with (sometimes moderate) breakouts.I prefer to spot apply it with a brush where needed.  I also store it in the refrigerator in hopes of preventing rancidity.In comparison to their old formula, this has lighter/whipped consistency.  It compliments my skintone nicely (that's the great thing about LBC, they have a wide range of Cool, Warm, and Neutral colors).Personally, I only apply it once, as setting it with powder afterwards tends to keep it from getting too oily during the day.  I've only used this twice since receiving it.  But I'm pretty sure if I do need to touch up, it will only involve oil blotting papers, and a light dusting of powder.(I really like LBC's loose powder *Neutral: Ivory Lace*, as well as ""Silk Veil"", and ""Finishing Powder"")I appreciate that LBC has natural/organic healthy ingredients (I've included a picture of the label below), in a wide array of products, and colors.  You might also be surprised to find out that this has an SPF 28 rating!Also of note, the packaging is now a frosted glass.  There is only a very faint scent (almost like cucumber), which is not in any way perfumey.Personally, I'm not sure if I like it more than my previous foundation (Raw Skin Ceuticals: Cosme.Ceuticals Creme Foundation - N101), but it's worthy of 4 stars.I definitely recommend LBC's products for anyone who has sensitive skin/allergies, or are looking for a more natural makeup.You might want to buy a few sample colors prior to purchasing a full size:  laurenbrookecosmetiques.com/collections/product-samplesAlso, I suggest you ""like"" LBC's FB page, as they have weekly giveaways:  facebook.com/LaurenBrookeCosmetiques **Stay tuned, they're about to release a skincare line!**","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WBYE3AB9GY54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EW1X6X6#wasThisHelpful","R2WBYE3AB9GY54","A23KZBVCFKW1XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23KZBVCFKW1XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm an Earl Grey tea lover!  I've tried about 12 different brands in the last couple of years (and the second blended in Scotland).As it was a good deal in the Warehouse, I thought I'd give it a try!  To my surprise, instead of receiving one 8.8  oz. bag, they sent me a case of TWELVE!  So I actually paid $0.39 a bag :DWhen it's loose, I don't make my tea as strong as maybe some do, so perhaps that's why the bergamot oil didn't come across as much as I had hoped.  But as a black tea, it is very pleasant!  Next time I'll use less water, and see how it tastes.I really like a strong bergamot flavor, and as I haven't found any ""food grade"", I may try scenting it with the essential oil I have (someone suggested putting 20 drops on a cloth, or paper napkin, and leaving it in a jar of tea for a couple of weeks).For more info on the company, and where they source their teas, go here: brodies1867.co.uk/teaI would definitely recommend Brodies to anyone that likes black tea in general; but whether it will satisfy your bergamot craving, that's subjective!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BNAY6TZANSQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MA5NGH2#wasThisHelpful","R1BNAY6TZANSQZ","A23KZBVCFKW1XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23KZBVCFKW1XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Be warned, you will have to get past the bitterness to experience the benefits!It is absolutely VILE on its own; I've never tasted anything so bitter!

"This is the first product from this brand I've tried.  To be honest, I usually make my own gluten free cakes, being that gf mixes can be iffy.  I've tried both from ""Betty Crocker"" (yellow and devil's food).  I attempted to make the chocolate one from ""Bob's Red Mill"" but couldn't get past the nasty smell (from the pea flour?), so I didn't even bother to cook it!  Before I bought this mix, I checked out the website first.  Here's what they list:""ORGANIC DEHYDRATED SUGAR CANE JUICE, ORGANIC RICE FLOUR, POTATO FLOUR, ORGANIC COCOA POWDER, ORGANIC CASSAVA STARCH, ORGANIC SORGHUM FLOUR, TEFF FLOUR, ARROWROOT STARCH, SEA SALT, BAKING SODA, XANTHAN GUM, VANILLA POWDER, BAKING POWDER, GUAR GUM.  Ingredients are 75% Organic by weight""  (There's a nutritional label as well, but I can't copy/paste.)  The 2 recipes included on the back of the bag are for using the whole bag for many cookies, and multiple cakes.  However, if you go to the website, you will find recipes for normal sized portions (I believe all call for 2 1/2 cups mix-- whether it be cake, cookies, brownie, etc.)  I followed the cake recipe cited, and put it in a bunt pan.  For a richer option, I added sour cream (the recipe online says you can add 6 oz. of dairy or soy cream cheese), and decreased the water amount to about 3/4 cup (instead of the called 1 cup).  The consistency wasn't as heavy as I expected, but still satisfying.  There is no grit to it either (some mixes add corn meal)!!  I also like the fact that it has more healthy flours like Teff, and Sorghum!Those that have an allergy to corn or soy ingredients are sure to appreciate this!  Plus there are ""vegan"" options to the online recipes!In conclusion, if you love chocolate, or are just looking for a tasty gluten-free cake mix-- look no further than ""Mina's Purely Divine Chocolate Baking Mix""!!

"My first experience with ""black soap"" was a sample of ""Shea Terra Organic's Rose Hips Black Soap"" (which is around $15-16 for only 4 ounces).Because of the price (vs. amount of product), I thought I'd search for a cheaper alternative, which I thought found in ""Nubian Heritage"" (13 ounces for $6.56 via VitaCost).When I first received it, I decided to first try it on my face (which was the main reason I purchased it). However, because of the strong perfume scent (doesn't seem like it's of a synthetic source, but very potent just the same), I will no longer be using it on my face. Long after I washed it off, I could TASTE it on my lips (and I didn't even intentionally place it there, just rinsing it off must have), and the scent was still very apparent.The ingredient list is INCOMPLETE on here, so here it is:""African Black Soap (palm ash, tamarind extract, plantain peel ?), Cocoamidopropyl Betaine (Coconut Oil Soap), Decyl Glucoside (Sugar Beets), Lauryl Lactylate (Palm Kernel), Deionized Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)*, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Santalum Album (Sandalwood), Essential Oil Blend, Jojoba Beads, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Salicylic Acid, Dead Sea Salt, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*. ONLY the Shea Butter, and Aloe are ""Certified Organic"".""Note: Japanese Honeysuckle Flower Extract is actually a (natural) paraben, for more information go to: organicconsumers (dot) org/articles/article_17679.cfmNubian Heritage Black Soap has a water based gel consistency, and lathers very well with lots of suds...In conclusion, I can tolerate the soap on my body, but when it's gone I don't plan to buy again.________As for ""Shea Terra"" the latter is more thicker and sticky (kind of like molasses), with a slight (pleasant) scent to it as well, but I haven't noticed that it lingered after I washed it off.If you want to know the ingredients in ""Shea Terra"" here it is:""Deionized Water, Yoruba Black Soap (Cocoa Pod Ash, Plantain Peel Ash, Palm Kernel Oil, Camwood Bark), Certified Organic Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Certified Organic Coconut Oil (Cocos Nucifera), Potassium Hydroxide, NOP Certified Organic, Virgin Rose Hip Oil (Rosa Mosqueta), Rose Hip Fruit (Rosa Canina), Aloe Ferrox, Rooibos (Aspalathus Linearis), Kigelli (Kigelia Africana), Certified Organic Marshmallow Root (Althea Officinalis), Licorice Root (Glycryrrhiza Galabra), Citric Acid"" .______Since trying the ""Nubian Heritage"" I again searched for another ""black soap"".This time I ordered ""AAA Shea Butter"" which is $15 w/ PRIME (there is also an 8 oz. available for cheaper). The consistency is smooth/soft, with no black color at all, and best of all-- no strong fragrance!!The ingredients list is quite a bit smaller than the other two. If you go to their website, this is what they have listed: ""Our Liquid Black Soap is made only from Coconut Oil, Palm Oil and Alkaline-Cocoa Potash (obtained by burning Cocoa Pods into ash) and Shea Butter. Our Anti-Bacterial Liquid Black Soap is made from Coconut Oil, Palm Oil and Alkaline-Cocoa Potash (obtained by burning Cocoa Pods into ash), Shea Butter and Neem Oil.""**Just an FYI, Neem Oil has a rather pungent odor (kind of like burnt rubber in my opinion).

"If you don't know the benefits (and let me tell you, they are MANY) for this wonderful seed/oil, please look it up!A couple of months ago I was looking up ""black currant oil"", and in my search I came across black seed.  After reading the info on several informative websites, I found that it does many things that oregano oil does (fights virus, bacteria, etc.).  **See edit below.**It's also a wonderful EFA, so if you've been looking for a good source that doesn't involve fish, look no further.Truth be told, I first purchased the one from North American Herb & Spice Co.  The one thing I didn't care for is it has added things like oregano, garlic oil, etc.  AND  their product is  more expensive for less oil!  While the added ingredients may be good things in themselves, and are added for their preserving factors; I decided I wanted to try it on my skin as moisturizer, so I searched for a 100% pure brand-- this being my choice.I've been using it externally, specifically on my face for a couple of weeks now.  Mine tends to be oily/combination, with breakouts.  I'm extremely pleased with the results so far.  Not only does it soak in right away, but it also doesn't leave a greasy filmy residue.  It doesn't seem to be making more breakouts, and it helps the skin to heal.If you're like me, and are looking for a more natural approach to skin care-- you should really give this a try!!**Also, if you find you're having a hard time digesting your oil (later burping it up may be an indication), I recommend looking into a Lipase enzyme for this!**  In conclusion, my family and I are pleased with this company's product, and will continue to buy this product in future!P.S.  For internal use, I've been using this oil in conjunction with Oil of Oregano, Super Strenght 83-85% Carvacol, Pharmaceutical Grade. Wild Oregano From Greek Mountains to keep me and my family from getting sick.  I earlier mentioned that my go to oil was the ""Oreganol P-73"" from NAH&S Co., but the expense was too much ($40+ for 1 oz. of oregano mixed with olive oil base).The product/company link above is based in Greece, and they offer 100% PURE oregano oil!  Making a 2 full ounce bottle for around $30 and some change (international shipping included)-- what a bargain!!!  I just add about 3 or 4 drops of ""Teliaoil's"" oregano to an empty capsule, and fill the rest of the capsule up with ""Amazing Herbs Black Seed Oil"" (follow with a meal, or a large glass of water/liquid).

"Wow, I can't believe how quick and easy this gluten free bread mix is!!  My family and I have tried making a gluten free mix or two in the past; then resorted to following a recipe (such as one by ""Gluten Free Mama""), but none of them have ever been this simple!I ended up using a ""quick rise"" yeast packet (which is NOT provided), and following the ingredient suggestion exactly (the egg, AND yeast is optional).  The other two ingredients are 1 3/4 cups warm water, and 2 tablespoons oil (used grapeseed).  I poured the warm water in with the packet of yeast, then followed with the beaten egg, and oil mixture.  Then simply let rise atop preheated (gas) stove, which only took about 20-30 min.Actual baking time took 30 minutes (can go up to 40 if need be).  After baking, I turned out onto glass dish (directions say wire rack), and immediately sliced.  It is a bit moist (which was to be expected since I didn't let it rest); but sliced without crumbling.  The taste is great!  Nothing is overpowering or ""off"".I actually purchased this on the ""Warehouse"" side, and saved a few extra dollars (it was $15 something)-- so really, per box, it was cheaper than a loaf of GF frozen bread at the store!In conclusion my family and I are completely happy and satisfied with this particular mix, and will consider purchasing ""Australis Foods"" products in the future!______________Edit:  The second time I made it, the yeast didn't make the bread rise (even though it was fresh, and fast acting). I'm thinking that just as traditional bread recipes call for a bit of sugar to feed the yeast, that is what should be done for this. Also, instead of mixing all ingredients together right away, let the yeast/sugar/water sit for 5 min's or so (until frothy), then add the rest!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R391M47G0C5MSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZFNXTS#wasThisHelpful","R391M47G0C5MSX","A23KZBVCFKW1XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23KZBVCFKW1XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, I don't own a microwave, so instead of nuking it for 3 1/2 minutes as directions say, I added boiling water to the line, stirred, and returned to the pan to cook (there is actually no printed ""stove-top"" method, I just used my noodle *pun intended*, and tried it anyway)...For those campers that don't have an RV style kitchen, and are considering this product, this is what you can do!Personally, the taste is neither rave worthy, nor disgusting enough to throw away.  Thankfully I received it at a great discount price (in the $4 range for 6), so I'm not upset about the cash spent.  The sodium count is a bit high though (670 mg. or 28% of  daily value).  I didn't exactly measure the cooked portion, but I would say it's about 1 cup or a tad over.  It DOES have corn (oil) in it, so for those with an allergy, be warned.  It is however ""free from wheat, gluten, soy, eggs, and nuts"".I can see how this would be very convenient for those who like to cook via  microwave, and need something gluten free in a hurry.  ..But for me, I much prefer Annie's brand (regular or ""creamy deluxe""), if I want boxed GF mac & cheese.Another option would be to buy ""Riega (Gluten Free) Cheese Sauce Mix""- there's different flavors: Alfredo, Yellow or White Cheddar, or Pepper Jack. Add your choice of gluten free noodle.Personally, if I'm craving cheese and noodles I usually make a 2 person serving of Fettuccine Alfredo (old ""Taste of Home"" recipe), with ""A Taste of Thai"" wide) noodles, to share with another family member.  Or if it's just myself- fast and simple version: grated parmesan cheese, TBSP of butter, splash of cream or half & half, a little ground nutmeg & black pepper/salt.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQMWI5L2ACR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TPUT9Y#wasThisHelpful","R2IQMWI5L2ACR7","A23KZBVCFKW1XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23KZBVCFKW1XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just received these today.  This is my first experience with this brand, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  The color and nice silver sheen are very pleasing.  I did try them on, but have not worn them out yet.I will say this, that although I checked the sizing prior, and found that my height (5'2""-5'3"") and weight are within the ""A"" range, I think the next time I order this brand, I will buy the ""B"".  They fit fine, but I'd like a little bit more length at the waist.  I was told by a friend, that to extend the life of your nylons, to wash prior to wearing.  I'm doing some research on the net, to see what people have to say on that.  In doing so, I came across a helpful page called ""Protecting Pantyhose"" at Stretcher (dot) com.

"The reason I purchased this was because it happened to be the cheapest organic whole bean coffee I could find that day (at least on Amazon).  The one good review it had made me hopeful.  I just received this today; and finished my 2nd cup just a few moments ago.  The only thing I added to it was some half & half.  I must say that this is probably the least flavorful organic coffee that I've ordered (""Camano Island"", ""Cameron's"", ""Jeremiah's Pick"", & ""Cafe Altura"")!  Upon opening the bag there's no pungent coffee aroma-- you pretty much have to stick your nose in it to get a scent.  The bag itself is the thinnest I've received (compared to the above ones I mentioned); which will most likely not help in keeping it fresh.  It's about as thin as a chip bag found in the grocery store.  ...I do store my coffee in the freezer, hoping that it will lock in the freshness.The beans look okay; but I've had beans with a much more oily coat than these.  The taste itself is pretty bland.  There's nothing extremely discernable about it.  Maybe the SLIGHTEST hint of chocolate, but not much..  It's not terrible, but if you're expecting a dark rich flavor from this, be advised.Lastly, the number on the bag is untraceable.  If you go to GoodOrigin (dot) com , you can search to see which farm it came from.  However, upon choosing the right product, the pull down number tab does not yet contain the number on my bag (280720).

"I've been using different kinds of mud/clay mixtures for years to diminish blemishes, and cleanse pores.  However, none of the ingredients in those have ever compared to this!  This is totally natural, and there's so many wonderful Indian/Ayurvedic herbs in this!!  I was reading about the benefits of using Amalaki/Indian Gooseberry on your face; and after some research, I learned that it's a wonderful source of vitamin C (antioxident), that also comes in supplement form.  That's actually how I found this product (after searching Amalaki on VitaCost).  After reading some of the reviews, and going over the product list, I thought I'd give it a try.Well, tonight was my first application, which I applied to my face, and part of my neck.  The directions say to keep the mud wet, so I did.  It has a cooling feeling; very pleasant.  The fragrance is very interesting, but not offensive in the least!  I left it on for about a half hour, and rinsed off.  The end result, is that it didn't overly dry my face like some other mud/clay mixtures.  It gave me a nice light rosy glow (and a more even complexion), and my skin felt soft!!  I still had some left over, so after the initial rinse off, I used a little bit as spot application.  The previous carbon mask I was using will now be replaced with this (it's actually more economical too)!!!

"I had been craving a soda cracker/saltine for a long time, but because have a gluten sensitivity, I can't.

They come in one large ""board"" (like graham crackers do), not in individual squares like ""Zesta"", etc.  (So, one board is about equal to 4 regular saltines).

"This is the 2nd variety of rice that I've tried from this brand.  (FYI, the ""Forbidden"" (black/purple) rice is out of this world!!)  Being that this is organic, ecologically farmed, and fairly traded- the price seems extremely reasonable (especially with the ""subscribe & save"" discount)!  The reviews seemed promising, so I took the plunge!!  Thankfully they were all right on target; hands down, this is the BEST brown rice my family and I have ever tried! It's not tough, or chewy, and doesn't take very long to cook.  To be honest, when I first opened the bag, the scent almost smelled a little rancid (but maybe that's just the way rice bran smells??).  However, our fears were allayed with the first bite!  It's got a very pleasing taste, and not overpowering.  I've tried it in 4 different dishes/ways, and each time it's been a perfect addition!  (With Kung Pao chicken & veggies, in a ""Nueva Cocina"" chili mix, homemade lentil soup, and with cinnamon, sugar, and milk.)  I'm definitely looking forward to trying more of the ""Lotus Foods"" rice varieties; but I'm sure I'll be buying another bag of this before too long!!EDIT:  Since the above review, I purchased the ""Madagascar Pink"", sadly my family and I didn't like it as well as the ""Mekong"". It was a bit dry and bland.We also tried the ""Jade Pearl"", and liked it much better than the ""MP"".While it's definitely a rice suited for sushi makers, we purchased it to try with stir-fry's and such.

"Okay, I love this humidifier... but one warning. If you are wanting a warm mist it really doesn't have one... the warm is barely different than the cold.  It only heats the water up to 80 degrees for warm and it doesn't seem to really make a difference when it is coming out. My only other complaint is the ultrasonic. I know they say that it makes for a quiet humidifier (and it IS SUPER quiet), but they don't at all describe WHY this works or what it's doing. I had to look it up. Basically it vibrates at such a fast speed that it breaks up the water into fine bits to mist out.  The drawback to a supersonic is that it also sprays out any minerals that are in the water as DUST.  So you want to use super pure water in it as much as possible.  So just an FYI about how it works, and the reasons I took off a star.  I don't want to be negative about this humidifier though... IT'S A GREAT HUMIDIFIER:It holds A LOT of water. I had mine on full speed and warm water for 10 hours and it didn't even use half of the water. I see this lasting three nights. Which is REALLY nice, I was getting really annoyed with having to fill up my other one EVERY STINKIN' NIGHT!  This is probably the beat feature of this humidifier!It has a really nice looking night light if you want one; it makes the whole water tank glow blue.  It has three settings as far as how much mist it puts out. It has cold and hot setting too, but like I said above I don't really see much of a difference between the two.  It also has a handy little timer button... you can set it to go off after 4, 8 or 12 hours. Nice if you want it to go off when you wake up in the morning but won't remember to turn it off yourself.  It also has a refill reminder light for when it gets low.Keep in mind that if you are wanting this to help you sleep with white noise, you aren't choosing the right one... it's SUPER QUIET!!

These have a double layer that adds a bit of bulk to them.

A bit slim fitting through the actual hip makes for a more tailored look... but still a nice enough long, loose cut that it is comfortable.Pockets are nice too... they have two good sized pockets (not huge like typical cargo shorts) on the sides; and it has a couple of little butt pockets that aren't super useful for much at all.Overall, my son really loves them and I can totally see him using them heavily in the summer months!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34FMQKXYTX5E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOZRJBU#wasThisHelpful","R34FMQKXYTX5E7","AUV3OR951650C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUV3OR951650C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are decent dress pants. My husband usually wears $70 dress pants so I wasn't sure how these were going to measure up.  They aren't bad but they definitely aren't anything super quality.The extender waist is awesome.  My husband, like many men his age, has a tendency to hold the weight in his waist. He's very slim and can only stand to lose several pounds, but it's always the waist that clings to him.  So to have the extra wiggle room is great. The extender works by having a strap you can pull tighter and then latch; and it has one on each side.  The drawback to that is he doesn't like the fact that it puts pressure on his gut area; which can cause him issues.  But it does work well as far as fit goes.Material is okay.  Honestly, it's 100% polyester and it didn't look great up close. Almost like a tablecloth. I was quite disappointed in that actually.Fit is okay too... it was a little long in the leg in spite of being his normal size.  And it's a bit baggy from front to back too.  Again, nothing hugely problematic, just little things that you slightly notice.Overall, it's a really good value and a good pair of low cost dress pants. But don't expect to be getting anything close to the quality of what you can get in a more expensive store.

"These go BARELY below the knee, more at knee level, on my 11 year old son.  They are REALLY thin in material, but not low quality, just a very lightweight short, perfect for summer.  They have two back pockets on the butt which are small and not very useful, but they have two cargo pockets on the sides of the leg which have a decent (not a ton) of room for a phone or other boy stuff.Waist fits nice on my slim son; he has some wiggle room. If your son is average or slim it will fit fine.  It has a very slim fit along the hips; more of a hip hugger, and then straight down from the leg.  It actually makes for a very nice looking short, very tailored looking.My son really loves these!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PAPTGEYDB8WD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9Y0HZA#wasThisHelpful","R3PAPTGEYDB8WD","AUV3OR951650C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUV3OR951650C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fits my 7 year old son perfectly. He's slimmer around the waist, and it fits him fine; but if your son was a bit thicker it would have plenty of stretchiness to fit as well.It's a longer short, right below the knee, but it doesn't look ""too"" baggy.  Just a good, comfy short.  The mesh is a little see through just along the bottom inch or so; I tested it in front of a sunny window and the rest is totally fine. I was a bit worried about that.

"This is t-shirt material and not the typical STX material shirt.  It is a good basic t-shirt... fits perfectly from side to side (more fitted but not too much) and is a bit long, goes down to the lower hips on my 9 year old son.  He usually wears a size 8... this one fits, but I think it's a little long still. Not a problem, he is not picky, and it's not long enough to bug my fashion views.Material is super comfy for a t-shirt.

One reminder from this radar detector and you watch your speed!!We have used it on an all day trip across two states and it really does work perfectly. A couple quick minor false alarms but otherwise it was super accurate. I don't mind it being safe and going off more, and it remembers the false alarms and won't pay attention to them after that if they are static spots.It's truly plug and play. I didn't want to mess with it and it was perfect for that.  I know I can set it up with the app but I didn't want that detailed of control.

"Other than the software disc being useless, this printer is top notch.  It hooked up to my Moto X phone in just seconds, and once I simply went into my printer settings on my computer it found it wirelessly and installed it in seconds.So how does it print?  Very nice!! I found it to be a tad yellow on some whiter photos but I can adjust it a little. The quality of pixels was amazing, even on plain cheap paper it looked like a nice picture!  It's quick too, in spite of working wirelessly. I live the two sided printing, that will save me money over my previous Canon printer in spite of the cartridges being almost 50% more. Hopefully that will be a wash and because it has an additional grey cartridge that will save too... I mostly print documents.If you are new to Canon you will love the efficient ink usage. They have separate colors so you don't toss a multicolor one like HP just because your yellow ran out. This has saved me a HUGE amount since I finally gave up the ink guzzler HP printers.This printer is super easy to print off fb, internet, cloud, etc... I have the Canon app on my phone and that makes it even easier.Oh, and one more nice upgrade is the lack of buttons on the printer, it is a touch screen like a smart phone. Really sharp, adds to the already sharp look.Scan and copy is a flat bed but works fine. Nothing fancy, just solid and easy to use. It holds separate trays for different size papers which is nice, and they slide seamlessly into the printer.  The printer takes up over a square foot of area but it helps that the front closes with no seams and will open automatically when it prints.VERY pleased with the upgrades from the previous versions!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUX5PNKL5A8NF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C0ZY3C#wasThisHelpful","RUX5PNKL5A8NF","AUV3OR951650C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUV3OR951650C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can also remove them by pressing them again.  If you want ALL of them, just press the orchestra button and it gets them all going.

"Okay, this had a potential to be a neat toy. But it's OBNOXIOUS.  Horrible, really loud music that you can't turn down.  Once I removed the batteries it was SO much better.  It has a little swirly platform that is activated by pushing down on a tower... like a supersonic merry go round. :)  And it has a fun slide. It has a little platform that you can move up and down; and a stable as well.  That is the extent of the toy though... so it's not a hugely interactive toy. It's okay... but it really fails in the lack of sound control and the lack of extensive features.My girls are enjoying it, I just don't see this lasting for long...

"I already use a liquid base from Lancome along with a color matched powder over it to control for oil.  So after applying my base I used this instead of my Lancome. I found it hard to get the right shade, to a certain degree; especially with my kabuki brush.  That being said, I then added a little bronzer to get the tone right on my face and it was all good.  The blush is a little TOO pale, in my opinion.  But I am impressed overall because I have a weird skin tone... I am super white/blonde but then with the Spanish in me I have some olive and yellow tones.  So it's always been hard to get my colors right in makeup (thus the expensive Lancome.)  This one actually worked on me... I was surprised.  The blush was nice for when I want to look more natural, but it definitely doesn't show much on me.  It is good on controlling my oily skin too, which is a huge plus for me.  Overall I am pretty happy... and I am glad I have a cheaper option that still works well for me.  I am not sure that I want to stray away from my perfectly matched Lancome... but it's 100% better than any ""boxed"" makeup I've EVER tried before, and I've tried a lot. Which is what led me to the matched makeup.  So it's nice to see one that will work at a fraction of the cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IWA2D3DV068G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2VQZG0#wasThisHelpful","R2IWA2D3DV068G","AUV3OR951650C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUV3OR951650C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This toy is PERFECT with the exception of one thing: not enough blocks to put into it!  I did take a star off for that.  But other than that it's absolutely great... it has a variety of easy to insert shapes including a rattle ball; and they match the colors on the lid which really helps.  The lid snaps on but not too tight that a toddler can't open it. But what's really ingenious is that you can bring this on the beach or in the bathtub... it has a bunch of little holes on the bottom so it's good for water too.

"I personally can't stand the doll... but my daughters do really like it for the feeding and changing aspect, which they can do for hours on end.  It DOES work well, and they enjoy changing her outfit, her diaper, cutting up all the playdoh and food, etc...CONS:So why the 3 stars?  A few reasons...Because invariably the playdoh gets stuck and you have to clean it out... That is the first. It's not horrible, but it does happen.  I've had to be patient and show them in detail how to feed her, and now that it's gotten stuck a few times they are being more careful.  Still a bit annoying.Secondly, the doll is a bit creepy. LOL  She makes all types of obnoxious noises and her mouth moves and I admit it kind of scared one of my girls at first until her older siblings were playing with her. LOL  Some of the noises are, well, kind of gross. LOLThird, the hair is not good quality.  It just gets so super tangled and within a week looks like a rat's nest.  And the doll is not very conducive to sitting up... the head is heavy, etc... so she is best in a baby chair while feeding.  She's also not good for cuddling AT ALL. She's great for play, and that's it.  And they LOVE it for that.Other than that it's a good toy, and ultimately I don't mind too much... any extra playdoh can be vacuumed up.  It's MUCH less messy than most dolls that you feed.  So I give it 3-1/2 stars.  If you don't mind some of the cons then by all means it's a great choice.. especially for older girls who are a bit wiser about how they feed the baby. :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I9EM5QVK9DFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOG4VQ6#wasThisHelpful","R2I9EM5QVK9DFB","AUV3OR951650C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUV3OR951650C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm not sure what it is, but anything train just gets used like crazy, and this one is no exception.  They latch on to each other relatively easily, sometimes my two year old needs a little help.  But they are interactive as well... they go over musical sounds, colors and animals, plus teach your child what each animal likes to eat and what noises they make.They could have been a bit more creative in that sense, so I took off a star just because I am not super enthused about it overall; especially since I have to keep putting the train back together myself, which is a bit annoying.But on the other hand my toddler is enthralled with it... and it's a reasonable price, so I am not going to complain. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RECTOL6BSCRNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCZV1R4#wasThisHelpful","RECTOL6BSCRNZ","AUV3OR951650C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUV3OR951650C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although limited by the electric cord rangewise (as long as your extension cord), otherwise this chainsaw is PERFECT and has some REALLY, really nice features.  Instructions are super useful; very readable in assembling it (minor easy assembly), very helpful in demonstrating safe technique and ways to cut trees in different positions, etc...Features: It has an auto oiling feature that REALLY is non-messy and you don't have to sit there and constantly pump oil onto the chain.  When you let go of the trigger, the chain INSTANTLY stops; so it's super safe and you have absolute control over it.  This somehow has a brake on it that immediately stops it.  It has an auto tensioner; so I don't have to go and constantly mess with special tools to get the tensioner right.  It's also super quiet... my wife was inside the house and didn't even realize I was not only running the chainsaw, but that it was chopping trees too.  It CUTS GREAT! It cut through my hard, dry wood very easily.  It has a cover that goes over the blade for safe storage. It's also lightweight compared to my gas chainsaw (which I will NEVER use again unless I am out of range of electric!!)I was super, super impressed by it...

The bad thing is that he can't operate it himself... you have to push down on the head to get it to ""smush"" down, which then operates the spring driven wheels. It shoots off gently... and it depends on how hard to push it down as to how far it goes. My 2 year old son LOVES pushing it and making it go.  And my 7 month old loves to chase it and knock it down.

Still, it definitely upped my connection and is helping out MUCH better; enough that I can get rid of the second router now too, which is super nice!#2: Setting a timer on your ""plug"" - This is great for when you are out of town; you can plug a light into it and set up times for your light to go ""on"" and ""off"", making it seem like you are home when you are not.  A really, really great idea.  It's really unlimited in it's use... I have a wifi baby camera (used for home security from a distance, not for baby) that I don't really want on when I am there (um, yeah... I think I may have walked across the kitchen nude once!)... so I can set it to go on only during the day while I am gone.  A really great idea and it works seamlessly.  Even better, you can control all of these settings on the app you can download.  Again, a great idea.Overall I am super duper pleased with this. I plan on getting more to expand my wi-fi even more!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUVQ74RHOR1KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDSL332#wasThisHelpful","RUVQ74RHOR1KZ","AUV3OR951650C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUV3OR951650C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is PLUSH. It's so ridiculously soft and cozy, my 7 month old attacked it and was squealing because it was so soft.  It's double sided and cozy on both sides... so it's super plush but not too ""fluffy"" that it's a danger in the suffocation department either.  It has a soft silky edge that babies really love as a contrast (baby loved to snuggle with the plush part and hold/touch the silk.)It comes in a very nice gift package with a pretty pink bow too.  It's not a ""normal"" baby blanket, it's unlike anything I've felt before.

"This is a great apron for both men/boys and women/girls.  My son (12) is actually the one I got it for since he has a tendency to wipe his hands on his shirt while cooking/helping in the kitchen.  He loves it... makes him feel like a professional chef. It also fits plus sized me... so it truly is one size fits all.  It has a simple round ring adjustment around the neck and the material is relatively thick and solid.  Construction is top notch too. Very robust.  It has a pocket on the front to hold a few little minor tools. Pretty simple; but works well. On my son, it goes to lower calf; on me it's just below the knees.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROMSR1LJOCB0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q8IT946#wasThisHelpful","ROMSR1LJOCB0E","AUV3OR951650C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUV3OR951650C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally, a seat made for the baby in mind instead of the parent!  My baby LOVES the bright colors and lots of animal faces with bright, big eyes... and the colorful puppets that attach to the bar (and you can make them talk and move too, which he loves even more!) Plus the seat is super cozy and has a typical angled position... but it ALSO can be adjusted to lay down flat for babies too... great particularly for the newborn.The bar is moveable too... it says it snaps in but it doesn't; however it's not super easy to come out so that's fine... it's sturdy enough and easy to remove. I love that it can bend closer to baby or further away based on how big/little baby is. Great idea.Sturdiness is great, and the padding/straps, etc... are SO cozy and soft. Plus gives baby some awesome little bumpers on each side for the littlest ones so they don't scootch around.  All those pads are removable for the older baby as well.Finally, the sounds/features... sound is a jazzy little tune, and it can be loud or medium leveled... no super quiet setting.  The vibration is a bit much, if you ask me... but I've never used it much anyway. Just be aware it's a bit more than usual.My ONLY complaint is that the ""leaf"" with the velcro isn't stitched on very well. I am finding just within a day of removing the puppets a couple times that it's breaking.  But you don't need the leaf to attach the puppets so I'm fine with it; they don't add anything to the bar itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23ETZB03L9GP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013Q138U8#wasThisHelpful","R23ETZB03L9GP4","AUV3OR951650C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUV3OR951650C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted to try out some Trijicon Glock HD Night Sight on both my Glock 23 and 26.  I had Truglo Tritium/Fiber Optic Sights on both Glocks and this tool removed them nicely.  Both the Trijicon and the Truglo have the angled sites that this site is for.This is the #309GLK tool - I used on both 23 and 26 - and Youtube videos show you can use this for the large frame Glocks if you remove the silver shim.  This is for the angled sights - there is another tool if you need it for non angled.Tool is very easy to use, very detailed instructions, and lots of videos of people using this tool to replace sights.Comes with a combo tool to remove the front sight and also take apart the Glock.Use oil on the threads. Which is indicated on the tool and the instructions.That bottom star shape screw you use to tighten/loosen your slide from the tool - mine came as a round turn with checkering on it for a good grasp.Very good tool that will last you a lifetime changing Glock sights - if you have multiple Glocks or want to try different sights out - or you want to be able to adjust your rear sight while at the range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FJ5AVCLOS0MM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037WCTZW#wasThisHelpful","R2FJ5AVCLOS0MM","A1EE1HLYUIJPIG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EE1HLYUIJPIG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This thing ROCKS!I'm a sucker for cleaning products/tools for firearms.  If they make it,  I buy it and try it out.  Well the Real Avid AR-15 Scraper Tool just plain works and is very compact.  Very smart design, compact, sturdy, and helps you clean that Bolt Carrier Group up nicely.  You could use this at the range if you want to shoot more ammo but you notice a lot of fouling or you can use it once you are at home and just cleaning your AR after a day of slaying paper targets (paper is all I slay, if you slay piggies, prairie dogs, or terrorists I am sure it will clean that carbon also).I also own the AR-15 CAT M-4 tool and the AR-15 LUG SCRAPER TALON TOOL  - I have them as part of the CAT M-4 Field Kit with a riggers sheath.  If you have the CAT M-4 Field Kit riggers sheath this slips and fits perfectly into it along with the other 2 cleaning tools.It gets into more areas than the CAT M-4 tool due to its design. If you already have the CAT M-4 tool - I still suggest you pick the Real Avid Scrapper up - one check out the price - that is cheap!  Two it gets into more areas than the CAT M-4, BUT I still like the CAT M-4 so I use both when cleaning.Comes on a thick-ish cardboard package  - on the back are pictures/descriptions of the areas of the BCG it will clean - good to keep while you get use to using the tool - I still reference it.

"I love Camo Form Protective Fabric WrapI have probably tried every pattern, and all of them so far worked out amazingly.So this stuff is like the medical wrap the nurse wraps around your arm after you gave blood with a cotton ball underneath, or the vet puts on your dog where they put an IV in him when you take him home. Suppose to be easy to stick and easy to remove, so as not to hurt you or your pet.Same stuff, just longer, and in cool camo colors. I have rattle canned, gunkoted, and more different rifles. Such a pain, and sometimes I end up going back to what I had in the first place. With these camo fabric wraps I can slap multicam one day and Snow the next on the same rifle. It is reusable, cleanable and has more uses.  To clean all I did was rinse in cold water, wring out a little and let hang on a towel bar.Wrap it around the stock multiple times and you created a better cheek weld, wrap around your pistol grip on that rifle and will create a no slip surface to hold onto. Break up the pattern on your rifle, change the look of your rifle in a couple minutes. If you don't like it take it off and wrap something else.

"Nursing. Is there any other major that puts so much stress on an individual AFTER graduation?If you're a nursing student, BSN or ASN, you know the stress of nursing school, and the excitement of finally graduating. But graduation does not bring lasting peace for we all have one more giant obstacle to overcome: the NCLEX.My story is like most of yours: I was never really good with NCLEX style questions. My school used ATI to ""determine"" our predicted success for the NCLEX, and I always fell in the 50% to 60% range. I was very discouraged for some of my friends were in the 70% and 80% range. But this book has made me in to a barely passing candidate to a candidate who passed with 75 questions.Some say that this book is ""too much material"" and I agree; it's like nursing school in a book. But, I spent over $2000 on nursing school books, but this $60 dollar book is the best comprehensive nursing book on the market. Everything in this book is broken down in to nursing process. When it explains a disease process and the nursing care associated with it, it goes step-by-step through the nursing process. It also has pictures of diseases that it talks about, and since I am a visual learner (especially learning diseases, and procedures) the pictures helped a lot.This book has a lot of material, but it also highlights the key materials you need to know with a green, pyramid symbol. If you study only the things with the symbol, you will be successful. But if you study the whole book (like I did over month and a half by studying 2 to 4 chapters a day) you will be beyond successful.After every chapter, this book has practice questions, which further reinforces your knowledge, and has clear, concise rationale. These questions were pretty easy, but the goal is to reinforce the teaching of the chapter. But where this book shines is the online question bank. When you purchase a NEW book with an unused code, you get access to their question bank. The Q-Bank has over 5000 questions, and over 500 alternative format questions (select all that applies, drag and drop, etc). These questions are high quality, and comparable to Kaplan and ATI. I also bought and downloaded NCLEX Mastery app on my phone. So whenever I had downtime I pulled out my phone to answer questions. The NCLEX Mastery questions were difficult (much more difficult then the NCLEX) which helped a lot as well.Far as what I did personally to study, I used virtual ATI and this book. Honestly, I feel like I wasted $400 dollars on Virtual ATI. They say they pair you up with a ""personal coach"", but all that the coach does is tell you to remediate, and send you passwords for additional tests. VATI was a waste of time. I used this book to study, and VATI for questions only.NCLEX is a nerve wrecking, sometimes stressful adventure, yes an adventure. If you were never strong with NCLEX style questions, and do not feel confident, like I did, buy this book, and put forth 100% of your effort in to this book. Give yourself a week break (after graduation) and focus on completing 2 to 4 chapters, everyday. Utilize the Q-bank this book offers as well. This book is priced at $60, but for me, it was priceless when it came to my NCLEX success.If I can do it, you can, too. Study hard, dedicate yourself, and you'll be a successfully practicing nursing in no time.Best of wishes,Danny","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RIQ2CY096AZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455727555#wasThisHelpful","R3RIQ2CY096AZX","A6KUT35GOLGRJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6KUT35GOLGRJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I left my Asus charger on an Amtrak bus when I was traveling.I looked for an Asus charger, and they were going to cost me $30.Yeah, I wasn't going to pay $30 dollars for a charger.And then I came across this charger.This charger does the job, it is 90W charger, and a little switch in which you can control the voltage (different laptops take on different amount of voltage to effectively charge/run the battery. You can check the bottom of your computer, or your laptop specs to know which watt and voltage your computer needs, which is important to prevent damage).This also came with different adapters for different sized plugs for laptops. This will come in handy, even when I get a new laptop, I can use this as a backup charger.WARNING: This does not fit some HP laptops. I read in some reviews that it didn't fit HP laptops, and I tried the adapters on my girlfriend's HP laptop, and it did not fit, therefore it is not really ""universal"". I do not know if it is due to the year of the model, or just HP itself, but if you have an HP chances are this will not fit your laptop (hence 4 stars, instead of 5 stars).All in all, it's a good, cheap charger that will not break the bank.

"I have quit for a good year, but recently I've had an urge and completed three cans of Cope pouches in 2 weeks. After my sister saw my can, and talked to me about it, I know I had to quit. And one of my friend's dad dying of cancer recently really reinforced that I needed to quit. So let's get to it.Pros:-Looks: It really does look like the real stuff. If I put side by side this product with Cope straight cut, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.-Feel: Even from the pinch, to your lips, and finally to the spitting, it feels and spits like real straight cut tobacco.-Taste: It tastes similar to regular straight cut, but not exactly the same. But I don't think anything comes close to tasting similar to it than this product.-Placebo: Every time I dipped Cope, my bowels would act up. Every time. When I put this stuff in my lips, my body reacted like it was the real stuff and began to brew some gas down there. Although the effect was not as prominent, the reaction from my body was still there due to the placebo.-Satisfies cravings: for me, it's not only the nicotine craving, but it's the physical act of pinching, putting in the lips, and spitting that triggers my cravings. Whenever I am studying, I crave dipping, but with these, whenever I crave, I put it in to satisfy my physical craving, and I'm fine. Really good product.Cons:-Artificial Colors, and preservatives: I was a little disappointed to see artificial colors and preservatives, it sure beats all the cancer causing substances in chewing tobacco.Conclusion:Very close snuff substitute without the tobacco or nicotine. Very satisfied with the product for it reduces my physical cravings of dipping. If you're trying to quit, give this a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17O6AH5JENE2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8OJPUK#wasThisHelpful","R17O6AH5JENE2C","A6KUT35GOLGRJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6KUT35GOLGRJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I am writing this, I put a pinch in my lips to test it out. I have quit smokeless tobacco, but recently I had the urge and bought two cans of Cope pouches. After a friend and my sister found out, I just wanted to quit once and for all, especially when one of my good friend's dad died of cancer.Anyways, going back to this product, one thing that stood out is that in the package, the seller does offer people 2 free cans for a good review. So if there is anything that we love most is FREE stuff. So I don't really know the legitimacy of some of these reviews. Now, let's go over the Pros and Cons of this products.Pros:-It's not tobacco, so even if you put a pinch of this in, it's million times better than putting in tobacco.-It smells great-It does give you some caffeine buzz, although I would much rather drink coffeeCons:-Consistency: it's like a sticky coffee grounds, glazed and  hardened with honey. It was not what I expected, it's pretty much a coffee ground candy.-It doesn't feel or spit like real chew: I have tried smokey herbal snuff, now that stuff looks, taste, feels, and spit like real dip. This, it just feels like coffee grounds stuck in your gum.-Price: honestly, if you buy high quality ground coffee, added some powdered creamer, honey, and got the consistency just right, you'll probably can make 10 cans of these, under 20 dollars. So I don't know if paying $5 dollars per can is worth it or not.Conclusion:It's not bad, per say, but it's nothing special. I like the little caffeine buzz I have going on right now, and it tastes good. And as a person that is drawn to dip because of the physical aspect of it (putting a pinch in, and spitting), putting this in definitely satisfies my physical draw to tobacco. However, I'm going to experiment with making my own, because paying 5 dollars per can, for me, is not justified.Also, people should fairly review products, not because the seller offers them two free cans for a positive review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NRIAKR10UXFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G784TFQ#wasThisHelpful","R2NRIAKR10UXFD","A6KUT35GOLGRJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6KUT35GOLGRJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Intro: This case is a solid case I chose to build my PC, it would have been a perfect, budget case, except for one flaw that I found.Pros:1) Price: for under $70 dollars, this is an awesome case.2) Configuration: both 3.5 and 2.5 inch drive bays for standard hard drive and solid state hard drive. Two USB 3.0 in the front is a plus.3) Easy to assemble: The optical drive bay was easy to use, which made things smooth. The case comes with railings for the hard drive, and has ample space for cord management and good airflow.4) Great airflow: multiple vents for good airflow, and up to 8 slots for case fans. One is already included (Front bottom).5) Solid construction: Feels sturdy and solid, and has an option for liquid cooling.Cons:1) This is the only con, and it's a weird one. I've noticed that when I placed my fans on the side vents, it would create a loud humming noise. I expect the fans to make some noise (blowing air), but this was more of a subtle, vibrating noise that was really loud. First, I thought it was the fan, but when I tested the fan, without mounting it on the case, it was fine. The culprit was the side vents. Whether it is due to the vibration of the fan causing the side vent to hum, or the airflow, I don't know. To remedy this, I had to put my side fans outside the vent it self, which, I didn't like at all.Conclusion: Solid case for the money, but I wish that the side panel was more sturdy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKSJO9VVEH2GP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EF9QEZC#wasThisHelpful","RKSJO9VVEH2GP","A6KUT35GOLGRJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6KUT35GOLGRJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This CPU is great, and for the money, you can't beat it. I chose this CPU which was recommended by jackfrags in his video (video about building a PC on a budget).There are a lot of discussion regarding Intel vs AMD, but the truth is, they all have their pros and cons. My budget was under a $1000 (for the whole PC), and this Processor hit the spot.Pros1) Price: Under a $1002) Great performance paired with Sapphire R9270x, 2gb. Tomb Raider on high setting with anti-aliasing, and motion blur turned off: avg FPS= 58. In Ultra setting, avg FPS= 45 to 50.3) Exceeds in everyday, mult-app performance.Cons1) CPU heat sink is adequate, but not great. If you are planning on overclocking, a good aftermarket CPU heatsink is a must. Otherwise you have the risk of overheating the CPU, causing damage.If you don't plan on overclocking, the heatsink that comes with it is fine, although it can be better.Conclusion: If you are on a budget, and want a CPU that has great performance which will bring out the most of your hard earned money, look no further.PS: For first time builders: this CPU goes in an AM3+ socket. Make sure your motherboard has a AM3+ socket.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QF09K07EM4JD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009O7YORK#wasThisHelpful","R1QF09K07EM4JD","A6KUT35GOLGRJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6KUT35GOLGRJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came to home brewing when I was bored and looked up hobbies I can take up, and slowly got more and more interested.I got this kit early this month, with the book How to Brew by John Palmer, which I highly recommend for anyone interested in home brewing. Though I cannot review on the quality of the beer (I bottled my first batch three days ago) I will write an honest review on the equipment, and ingredients that comes with this Mr. Beer Kit.IntroAs a beginner in home brewing, every home brewing term seemed alien to me, and seeing the 5 to 6 gallon carboy with contraptions like siphons, air locks, and hydrometers just confused. Therefore, I decided to get the most simplistic kit available, that's why I chose Mr. Beer. I will first start with the Pros.PROSMR. BEER Kit out of the Box , Perfect for Beginners  This is a perfect kit for absolute beginners on a budget. For 50 dollars, you get a fermenter, bottles, two hopped malt extract, yeast, and no-rinse cleansing solution. Almost everything you need is included, minus a large pot (enough to hold 4 cups of water), metal spoon, can opener, and a silicone spatula. The instruction manual is not clear, but Mr. BEER has a Youtube video explaining step-by-step on how to sanitize, brew, and pitch the yeast. Mr. BEER also gives you daily email (if you register) on subjects like sanitizing, science behind yeast and fermentation, and other useful information. Like I said it has 90% of what you need to get started.Ease of Use  Mr. BEER kit is easy to use. First you sanitize with the given sanitize solution. Then you boil 4 cups of water, add the hopped malt extract and stir until dissolved. Then you add 1 gallon of chilled water, add the wort, add another gallon of water, and then add the yeast. Finally, you close the lid and let it sit. of course there are more details involved, but it's pretty much as simple as it gets.No Gimmick, It Actually Brews  This is a legit, beer making kit. You can see everything happening in the fermenter: yeast fermenting, high krausen (peak of fermentation), layer of yeast in the bottom, and the clarification of the beer as fermentation completes. It's so fool-proof, it's guaranteed to make drinkable beer... note the drinkable part.Perfect for Increasing Knowledge  This kit is perfect for absolute beginners, who don't want to deal with a lot of complicated equipment, but as you brew, you will want to learn and start reading books and forums, like I did. As I gain more knowledge on the brewing process, watching videos and reading ""How to Brew"" by John Palmer, I see more and more future limitation when it comes to this Kit. This is where I start the ConsCONSLimited to MR. BEER Products  With this 8.5 Quart kit, you are limited to only using MR.BEER kit sold by MR. BEER. You can buy the standard 5 gallon recipe kit which makes 5 gallons, but you have to do the math and ratio out all the ingredients if you want to do so (who has time for that?). So unless you want to keep using hopped malt extract without using specialty grains, malt extracts, and add the hop yourself, this is obviously a kit that you'll ""graduate"" within time. But this kit is solely for Mr.BEER refills and nothing else.Quality of the Ingredients/ Yeast  As I learn more about specialty hop, adding hops at different times, and other brewing techniques required for home crafted beer, I find that just pouring a liquid extract to boiling water is very limited and restrictive. Also, the quality of the yeast is questionable, for it does not have a date, and who knows how long the yeast (refill) has been sitting on a shelf. According to Palmer, quality beer requires quality yeast, and with Mr. BEER, there is not telling the quality of the yeast that comes with it.Crude Ventilation/ Air Lock  This kit has ""air notches"": little holes on the mouth (top opening) of the keg which lets excess CO2 out, which, by theory can let oxygen in as well. Because how the lid is positioned, I do not believe a lot of oxygen gets in during the fermentation process, but the air notches are crude nonetheless.You Will Outgrow it Very Quickly  Though it is for beginners, you will outgrow it quickly. As I read more, and watch more videos, I am itching to get a standard kit (5 gallon carboy, siphon, airlocks, etc.) to ""graduate"" from this kit. It is perfect for beginners yes, but if I had to do it again, I would buy a standard starter kit (Northern Brewing, True Brew, etc) and start from there.ConclusionThis kit is awesome for beginners and those who want to start brewing without all the equipment. I will update this review on the quality of beer it makes.Note: I am following the 2-2-2 rule (2 weeks in the primary fermenter, 2 weeks of bottling, and 2 weeks of conditioning). Just FYI for those wondering the process I took.--------------------------------------------UPDATE 12/07/2014------------------------------------------------Beer taste: Wow, so I brewed the Aztec Cerveza and I am enjoying a glass right now, watching the 49ers v Raiders game. So this is the process I followed to brew this batch: 2 weeks in the fermenter, 2 weeks bottling/carbonating, and 2 weeks of conditioning in the fridge. However, I was curious and couldn't wait any longer. It's been 3 days of conditioning, and decided to drink it.This is an awesome tasting beer. More milder than other cerveza's out there, but awesome in every way. Good carbonation, good taste, and the best thing is that it is smooth. It has a hint of sour taste, but I think that is due to bottling a day or two early. But after this bottle, I will drink the rest of the bottles when the full two weeks of conditioning has been done.This is smooth, and very enjoyable beer. But be aware: home brewed beer has a certain taste to them. Internet forum describes it as ""the homebrew musk"". There is definitely that, but it adds to the richness of the flavor. I am very impressed.I bought one more keg: I bought one more keg. I thought about getting a 5 gallon, standard kit, but I am going to stick with Mr. Beer (I have changed my mind). It is simplistic, takes minimum equipment, I can brew multiple batches at one time, and the end result is outstanding.  Right now I have a pilsner and a stout brewing. Can't be more happy with Mr. Beer. For those people telling you that you can't brew good tasting beer with simplistic equipment like Mr. Beer, they are wrong. I wish you were here right now so I can have a glass with you.

"So, after trying (it seems like) every pre-workout outhere (NO Explode, C4, Bullnox, Animal Pump, Six Star Brand, Cyto Max, etc.) I wanted a pre-workout with high quality ingredients, no artificial anything, and something that only has right amount of scientific-based ingredients. Well, I found it, it's pure pump.Purepump only has the things you need: caffeine (green tea extract), beta alanine, creatine, AKG, amino acids, and vitamins. It's not ""proprietary blend"" (aka BS) and the amount of each ingredient is disclosed.Pros:It works. If nature created a fruit called ""pre-workout"" the chemical composition would be similar to Pure Pump. I feel better taking this because it is as natural as you are going to get. Like I've said, I've tried them all, and Pure Pump works. The price is competitive, but hey you get what you paid for.ConsI wanted to give this a five star, I really did, but I couldn't because of one major con: the taste. Now I've taken nasty supplements before (Garden of Life Raw Food, grass drinks, etc) but the taste in this is just right horrible. It is because there are no artificial colors, flavoring, or artificial sugar (which I love it doesn't contain it), but man does it taste bad. It taste like expired, Chinese herbal medicine mixed with some crushed up beetles (it's downright nasty). You can get some natural sweeteners, or lime/lemon powder to help you, but the taste is overwhelming.ConclusionAs natural as it's going to get, it works, and price is competitive. If you want a preworkout without all the BS, but with high-quality ingredients, this is for you. I will only use Pure Pump from now on but man, the taste is gonna take some time to get used to. Highly recommend, but you have been warned about the taste.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17N79MU5DQ4NJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XFKSDE#wasThisHelpful","R17N79MU5DQ4NJ","A6KUT35GOLGRJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6KUT35GOLGRJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's not as bulky as the g shock or other watches I had, and for the price, it's fantastic. If you are looking for a functioning with time, date, stopwatch and alarm, with a simple yet attractive design, look no further. If you are looking for a watch that cooks you breakfast, this watch isn't for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC9JXR0JFF4ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013HUMF2#wasThisHelpful","RC9JXR0JFF4ZD","A6KUT35GOLGRJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6KUT35GOLGRJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Far as stopwatches go, this is very functional. I need it for timing my self on the 2 mile run, and this is great.It has a large screen which is a plus, and something about clicking this thing is satisfying (the way the buttons feel).This is your basic stopwatch; functional and reliable.I took 1 star off because it didn't have memory to recall laps and splits, maybe this is asking too much for a stopwatch this price range, but I think this is a factor. All in all: reliable, functional, and get's the job done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26YSLKRDIXBTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002D3X4KU#wasThisHelpful","R26YSLKRDIXBTX","A6KUT35GOLGRJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6KUT35GOLGRJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got my Kindle 2 about a month ago, and I like it so far. I won't be the hysterical reviewer saying that ""this product changed my LIFE"" or anything like that, just an honest, helpful review. The kindle 2 is one thing: an e-book reader, and it gets the job done above my satisfaction. If you are looking for an internet browsing, MP3 compatible, and a device that does every pointless thing that wastes your time, get an I-Pad. As an E-Book reader, the Kindle 2 is tough to beat: with the 14 days battery life, free 3G download capability, and an easy-on-the eye screen, it is the best of any e-book reader. The design is slim and eloquent, it is efficient, and the prices of books are, on average, 4 dollars cheaper than print versions; which for avid readers, like myself, it is a huge money saved. It performs beyond my expectations, and worth every penny. Now, my constructive criticisms. The Kindle has a lot of room for improvement, and I believe Amazon is on the right track.1)The biggest criticism that I have is the lack of Titles, sure all the mainstream books are on the Kindle like: Twilight, Harry Potter, etc, but I outgrew that. Some of the books I want to read like, ""All God's Little Creatures"", are not available for the Kindle. In fact, if you are an avid reader, you will be disappointed when it comes to books available on the kindle.2)The second criticism I have, the keyboard: it's chunky, not spaced correctly (especially the M and N keys), and it is just there for downloading purposes without ergonomics in mind, can't we have both Amazon?3)Thirdly, the screen on the Kindle 2 can be bigger, just look at all the white plastic surrounding the screen.4) No interchangeable batteries. So if you run out, and you have nowhere to plug you can't read anymoreI am sure Amazon will fix these issues in the future, and I cannot wait what future Kindles will look like. This is only the second generation and Amazon made great improvements, I hope that they take all the criticisms as a blessing and blow us away with the Kindle 3.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BTC36U3WZJJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015T963C#wasThisHelpful","R2BTC36U3WZJJ8","A6KUT35GOLGRJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6KUT35GOLGRJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been trying for several months now to find a deep conditioner that works and can be used every day. I've tried a bunch of different ones, but none of them have really made a lasting difference in my hair. I did find a generic version of a Paul Mitchell product that works great, but it's not meant for every day use.I bought this on a whim at Shopko. I don't remember what I paid, but I think it was under $5. To be honest, this product isn't anything spectacular. It's not awful, but it's nothing to get excited about either. This product does leave my hair soft and healthy, but it doesn't last very long. By mid-day, my hair feels and looks like straw again.However, the biggest issue I have with this product is the smell. I really wish I had smelled it before I purchased it. It claims to be citrus scented, so I thought I was okay. But I was wrong. The first time I used it, the smell turned my stomach. In fact, I was tempted to wash it out right away. But I left it on. This stuff doesn't smell anything even remotely close to citrus. The scent is very hard to describe. It has this weird, almost chemical smell to it. It's very strong and not at all pleasant.I think I might try a coconut oil or keratin treatment next. I will finish up the bottle, but I wouldn't recommend this product, and won't repurchase.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC8CKFGUNPHKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D811YVM#wasThisHelpful","RC8CKFGUNPHKB","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a couple small clusters of whiteheads that I've been trying to get rid of for the past few months. I tried 3 different salicylic acid treatments, that got rid of some of them. But some of them were closed comidones (whiteheads which have completely plugged and clogged the pore) I found a site online that said for regular whiteheads use salicylic acid, but for comidones, use benzoil peroxide. I used the salicylic acid every day for about 6 weeks on the comidones with no effect whatsover. But I was very nervous about trying the benzoil peroxide because I have extremely allergy prone skin. I was also concerned about peeling and irritation. But the salicylic acid wasn't really working, so I decided to try the benzoil peroxide. I bought this on a whim at Walmart. I don't remember how much I paid for it, but I think it was between $4 and $6.I did try a 2.5% benzoil peroxide treatment from Neutrogenia that I had first. But again, even though I gave it a good amount of time, it didn't really take care of the comidones. But I was also pleasantly surprised. It didn't irritate my skin or trigger any type of allergic reaction. The list of things my skin has reacted to is long, so that is a definitely plus for me.I have to admit, I was more than a little worried about trying the 10% benzoil peroxide treatment. But nothing else I'd tried had really worked. Amazingly, it didn't irritate my skin at all.I started using it every night before bed. I'd usually apply it two times before going to bed. Once a couple hours before bed, and then right before bed. It has made a HUGE difference. The size and number of the comidones have decreased dramatically. Every day they get smaller and smaller. After a couple more days, they will be gone completely. I haven't had any trouble with skin discoloration or itching or anything like that.I do, however, have one major complaint about this product. The packaging is terrible. The tube itself isn't bad, but the cap is really hard to open and close. You really have to pull to get the cap open. I've found it's easier to just unscrew the cap and squeeze it out that way. This product works great, so it wouldn't keep me from repurchasing it, but the cover design really could use some work. Other than that, this is a great product, and I will keep it on hand. Just in case I get more whiteheads. Great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PJSQQ98VLH1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014VTOAQ#wasThisHelpful","R2PJSQQ98VLH1V","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was recently in my local Christian bookstore. I always enjoy poking around the clearance section. I have found some real gems (and a few duds) there in the past. So when I saw this title I was intrigued. When I read the description, I was even more curious. When I saw that it would cost me less than $3, I was sold. This book is written by a pastor who decided to try an experiment. He recruited people from his church to attempt to live out the multitude of rules and prohibitions found in the Old Testament book of Leviticus for 1 month. Eventually, 19 people agreed to accompany him on this journey. The 19 participates were comprised of people from various walks of life and religious backgrounds.This book was an easy read. I have to admit, even though I am very familiar with Scripture, I have been intimidated by the book of Leviticus. As the modern day Levites found out, it is not easy to live out Leviticus in the 21st Century. The results were pretty predictable. There was a lot of failure and frustration. The participants provided a lot of great insight and were honest about their struggles along the way. There were several times when I laughed out loud as I read.Pastor Harrell rightly states that obedience is a key part of the Christian life. We will never be able to be completely holy in this life. But that doesn't mean we should chuck the whole idea out the window. The fact that we are under grace through Christ does not mean that we are exempt from obedience and holiness. But it is only through Christ that we have any hope at all of being holy. We cannot do it on our own. I found it odd that Pastor Harrell and the participants focused only on the Old Testament. Especially since the New Testament has so much to say on the subject. I also find it odd that the book of Hebrews was never even mentioned. Especially since this New Testament book clearly shows how the Law was fulfilled by Christ.I don't doubt that everyone who took part in this experiment did so with good intentions. But I also believe that the experiment itself is fatally flawed. I understand what they were trying to do, but they were going about it in the wrong way.The New Testament  explicitly explains the purpose of the Law and why it was given. The book of Galatians compares and contrasts living under law and living under grace. Romans 3 also talks about the Law. Romans 5:14 tells us that the things that were written in the past (ie the Old Testament) were written for our instruction. It was written so we could learn from their mistakes. It was never intended as something for us to emulate. I think a lot of the time, we as Americans aren't willing to learn the lessons God wants us to learns. We write off the Israelites as ignorant. We think we would respond differently in the same situation. But human nature is human nature. It hasn't changed all that much. We are no better than the ancient Israelites, regardless of what we believe. I admit that I have often been guilty of this. For example, when reading about Adam and Eve and the Fall. I find myself thinking things like ""Seriously? They had complete freedom to eat from any tree in the garden. Except that one. Why didn't they just walk away? Why did Eve listen to the lies of the serpent? Just because Eve chose to eat the fruit, doesn't mean that Adam had to. He could have made the right choice."" I would like to think that if I had been in that garden, I would have made a different choice. But honestly, I'm not so sure. I am guilty of the exact same thing that Adam and Eve did. I blame God and other people for my sinful choices. I try to rationalize and justify my sin. There are times when I read a command or teaching in Scripture and tell myself that obedience is optional. We all do it. There are many lessons to be learned from the Old Testament. If we are willing to pay attention.To illustrate this, I am going to list a bunch of Bible verses from the book of Galatians. Unless otherwise noted, all verses are taken from the New Living Translation (NLT) My comments are in parenthesis at the end of each verse.Galatians 2:19 For when I tried to keep the law, it condemned me. So I died to the law-I stopped trying to meet all its requirements-so that I might live for God.Galatians 3:10 But those who depend on the Law to make them right with God are under His curse. For the Scriptures say  ""Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God's Law.Galatians 3:19 Why then was the law given? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins.Galatians 3:23 Before the way of faith in Christ was available to us, we were placed under guard by the law. We were kept in protective custody, so to speak, until the way of faith was revealed (The law was only intended to be temporary. Once Christ paid the penalty for sin on the cross and rose from the dead. The law was no longer needed. Christ Himself stated that He didn't come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it.)Galatians 5:1 So Christ has truly set us free. Now make sure that you stay free and don't get tied up again in slavery to the Law. (Salvation in Christ was first offered to the Jews and then to the Gentiles. Paul makes it crystal clear that Gentile believers were not required to keep the law, and Jewish believers were set from its requirements as well. This verse compares trying to please God by keeping the law slavery.  I simply don't get it. Why would anyone who has experienced the grace, mercy, forgiveness, and freedom that only Christ can give, want to go back to the old system of bondage?)Galatians 5:4 For if you are trying to make yourselves right with God by obeying the law, then you have been cut off from Christ. (This warning is never even mentioned in the book. But readers of the book would do well to heed it, if they ever feel the desire to attempt a similar experiment)Romans 3:19-20 Obviously, the law applies to those to whom it was given. For its purpose is to keep people from having excuses and to show that the entire world is guilty before God. For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands. The law simply shows us how sinful we are.The book of James also gives a clear picture of the futility of trying to keep the law to earn God's favor.James 2:10 (NIV)For whoever keeps the whole of the law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. This verse reminds me of a project in my 8th grade Tech Ed Class. We made bottle lamps out of champagne bottles. In fact, I still have mine and can see it as type this. One by one, the teacher asked each student to plug their lamp into the socket. If it lit, you got an A. If it didn't, you got an F. Those were the only two possible grades. It was pass or fail. This verse from James tells us the same is true in regards to the law. There is no grading on the curve. If you keep the law perfectly, down to the smallest detail, then you are declared innocent. If not, you are found guilty. But you aren't just guilty in the area where you fell short. If you break God's law in one area, you are guilty of breaking His law in every area.  Even if it was just a minor infraction, it doesn't matter. You are still guilty. That is what makes grace so incredible and amazing. Jesus did for us what we could never do for ourselves. He set us free from the penalty of sin and the law.)God give us a choice. But there are really only two options. We can either try to live a righteous life on our own by keeping the law(and fall miserably short) or we can accept the grace, mercy, forgiveness, and freedom that Christ paid such a heavy price to secure for us. But we need to understand, that the stakes are incredibly high and the consequences are serious and eternal. We can't have it both ways.One of the best resources that I've found on the Old Testament is a book called ""The Message of the Old Testament.""  by Mark Devers. In this book, Pastor Devers goes through each book of the Old Testament. First he gives some background information for each book. Then he lists and discusses in detail the main themes and teachings of each book. Lastly, he shows how the Old Testament and New Testament are linked. A friend sent me this book a couple of years ago. It has greatly helped my understanding and appreciation of the Old Testament. Pastor Devers also has a similar book on the New Testament.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11TYVZBNP6CIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071ULLUA#wasThisHelpful","R11TYVZBNP6CIB","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using Lancome Teint Miracle for the past couple of months. I found to be an average foundation. It's not awful, but it's not amazing either. I didn't like that it turned into a greasy mess on my nose, and the staying power wasn't the greatest either, even with primer. I bought Skin Balancing foundation from the Body Shop (it was on sale for $5 and is usually $22) and also got a sample of Laura Mercier Oil Free Supreme Makeup. Neither one really worked for me. One foundation that I wanted to try was Makeup Forever HD Invisible Cover Foundation. I stumbled across a blog online that said Revlon Photoready Liquid Makeup is a dupe for MUFE HD Invisible Cover.There is a grocery store about 2 blocks from my house that has a small cosmetics section. They carry Revlon and Cover Girl cosmetics. I know a lot of people on this site really like Revlon Colorstay. They have a formula for oily skin. It took me a while to decide between that foundation and the Photo Ready Liquid Foundation. In the end, I decided to try the Photoready foundation.I have to be honest, I'm generally not a big fan of drugstore foundations. Either I'm allergic to something in it, it looks great at first and fades away to nothing after about 3-4 hours, or looks cakey, heavy, and thick. I've tried a couple of drugstore foundations that never even made it out of the house they looked so awful. (L'oreal Infallable, the Body Shop foundation I mentioned earlier, and Maybelline Fit Me all fit into this catagory) Also, finding the right shade in drugstore foundations is both challenging and frustrating because there are no testers. The store lights make it hard to choose the correct shade. It can look one way in the bottle and totally different when you put it all. I've noticed that drugstore foundations also have a tendancy  to oxidize more than high end foundations.I intially purchased the Photoready in shade 06 Medium Beige. It looked like a perfect match when I first applied it, but it did oxidize a little. I didn't look like an oompa loompa or anything, but it was definitely a little too orange. It wasn't enough to be embarassing, but it was noticeable. So I went back to the store and did an even exchange for the next shade down, which is natural beige. This seemed to be a much better match for my skin.Here is how I apply it: First, I apply a tiny amount of my Aveeno Baby Daily Moisturizing Lotion and rub it in completely. Then I apply the foundation, and finish it off with a light dusting of loose powder.This stuff is amazing! It doesn't transfer, it looks natural, and the staying power is great. I've had it on almost 9 hours and it still looks great. It has only worn off the tiniest bit on my nose. The coverage is amazing too. It does a good job of covering up the redness and smoothing out the tiny bumps on my face. It dries quickly, but not too quickly. It is easy to blend and is buidable. I usually apply two thin layers and it never looks cakey or heavy. I paid $14.99 for this foundation, but I found it at Target for $10.99 I absolutely love this foundation and hope that it is never discontinued. There are a lot of reviews out there that say this foundation doesn't work very well on oily skin. But it's worked great for me. My search for my HG foundation is over!I've never actually tried the MUFE HD Invisible Cover, so I can't really say if it's similar to that or not. I NEVER thought I would fall in love with a drugstore foundation. Never in a million years. But I have. The MUFE HD costs $45 for 1 oz of product. The Revlon Photoready is $10.99 for 1 oz. I don't mind paying $45 for a foundation, but why should I when there is a drugstore version that costs about 1/3 the price? It's a no brainer for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZTM2XB3CNPUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030HAE4W#wasThisHelpful","R1ZTM2XB3CNPUM","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since college, I've struggled with my weight. I was never obese as a child or a teenager. But once I hit my 20s and 30s, I started gaining weight. At my heaviest, I weighted 260 pounds. I'm tall (about 5'11) so I didn't look awful, but I definitely feel as good. I also was diagnosed with both high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I finally realized it was time to make a change. I eventually decided to a modified version of Weight Watchers. I followed the eating plan, but didn't go to meetings. I was successful, I ended up losing 60 pounds.  But eventually, I got frustrated and fell of the wagon. I ended up regaining about 20 pounds. It wasn't enough that I had to go back on my meds and none my clothes fit, but it was still disappointing. There were several things about the Weight Watchers plan that I found frustrating and hard to stick with. First, it was hard to stick to the plan during special events like holidays and parties. I enjoy going out to eat with friends on occasion. When I was following Weight Watchers, I was often confronted with a choice: Do I eat what I want, feel guilty, and blow my diet? or do I order something I don't really want just to stay true to my diet? I have to be honest, there were times when I ate and ordered things I really didn't want, just for the sake of staying true to my diet. When I first started Weight Watchers, the Points Plus system didn't bother me. But after a while, I got really tired of having to look up the point value for every single thing I put on my mouth. When I cook, I make a lot of casseroles. I do try to prepare healthy meals. But it got really tedious having to look up the point values for each ingredient in the casserole.I have read countless diet books and haven't found one that really provided what I was looking for. Either they were too restrictive, too complicated, or didn't give me enough guidance about how and what to eat. I wanted to find a diet that didn't require any measuring, counting, or complicated formulas. I wanted a weight loss technique that gave me freedom to make my own choice, made nothing off limits, and could be easily incorporated into my lifestyle. I recently purchased a copy of Women's Day Magazine. In there, there was an article that mentioned this book and eating plan. To be honest, I was skeptical. I have found that if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. But I was intrigued by the idea of 1:1:1 so I ordered a sample on my Kindle. I figured if I hated the book, I hadn't lost anything. I was so impressed by what I read in the sample that I immediately ordered the full book.The premise of this book is incredibly simple. You simply eat one carb, one protein, and one fat with each meal and snack. That is it! There is no counting of anything (fat, carbs, points, calories) and no hardline restrictions or foods that are off limits. the doctor also gives you a huge selection of possible meal ideas and recipes using normal, every day, easily available foods. But the possibilities for meals are really endless. I disagree with a previous reviewer who said that you have to eat 2 or 3 items with every meal and snack. I disagree. For example, today for lunch I had a tuna sandwich. This fits the 1:1:1 framework. The tuna was the protein, the two slices of bread was the carb, and the mayo was the fat. Everything all in one neat easy package. This is not a diet, it is a lifestyle change. If you want to have chocolate, ice cream, dessert, or a baked good, you can with this plan. You can eat whatever you want without feeling guilty. the author is a nutritionist, so of course, she does encourage you to make healthy choices as much as possible, but she also gives you permission and freedom to indulge is some so-called unhealthy choices from time to time. You are allowed a generous portion of food on this plan. You get 3 meals and two snacks. She breaks it down in a way that is easy to apply and understand. She also gives you suggestions as to what to eat. But she also makes a point of saying that these are simply ideas, they are NOT a set meal plan.I read this book in one sitting. As soon as I read the last page, I thought to myself ""Now, this I can do."" I can't wait to give it a try. If you are sick and tired of complicated, restrictive, or fad diets, do yourself a favor and purchase this book. You won't be sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8BD3WCTY6FZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BY5907Y#wasThisHelpful","R8BD3WCTY6FZW","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been using Burt's Bees Sensitive Facial Cleanser with Cotton Extract. I liked it, but it comes in a 5oz tube that was lasting me about a month. It was also $9.99. I was wondering around Target and saw this product. It's $8.99 for a 12 oz tube. I also like that has a pump rather than a squeeze tube. It makes it much easier to control how much comes out. My skin is very oily and very allergy-prone. I've had allergic reactions to products that claim to be for sensitive skin before. So I'm a little apprehensive about trying new things in my face. I never really know how my skin is going to react.I can't really comment on how this cleanser works for removing makeup, because I don't use it for that. I use it to cleanse my face in the shower. This cleanser claims to be Ultra Gentle and it definitely is. It didn't irritate my skin or cause any type of allergic reaction. It rinses off in a snap and doesn't leave any kind of a film behind. It foams nicely and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh after I use it. I also like that you get 12 oz of product rather than 5 or 6 oz like other facial cleansers.

"I purchased this because I was having trouble finding the correct shade of Lancome Teint Idole Ultra. The shade I purchased was WAY too dark and make me look like an oompa loompa. But I lost my receipt and wasn't able to exchange it until I got my new state id. So I needed something for a few days. I saw a lot of positive reviews for this, so I decided to give it a try. I also had heard that it was a drugstore dupe for Makeup Forever Mat Velvet.I feel like the foundation was nothing but a huge waste of money. I honestly don't understand why this product has so many positive reviews. It's not the worst foundation I've ever used, but it's the third worst foundation I've ever used.I read all the previous reviews on this site, and saw that there are several reviews that state this is a full-coverage makeup. I disagree. In my opinion, it's sheer to light coverage. It's a long way from medium coverage, much less full coverage. I have a lot of bumps and redness on my face, especially on my chin, nose, and cheeks. I applied it using a brush. It literally did NOTHING to cover up the redness. Even after blending, you could still clearly see the redness through the makeup. It also settled into very bump on my face and made them stand out even more. It didn't do anything to blur or cover them.As far as being buildable, forget about it. When I tried to build it up in areas where I need a bit more coverage (especially on my cheeks) it looked (and felt) heavy and cakey. I've also tried Makeup Forever Mat Velvet, which is much more buildable, and looks a lot more natural. In my opinion, that makeup has nothing in common with this one. I do like the Mat Velvet, but it turned into a greasy, slimy mess in the areas where I'm most oily. So I quit using it.I can't really comment on the staying power of this foundation because I only had it on for about 10 minutes. I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this out in public. If you have flawless skin and only need sheer to light coverage, you will probably love this makeup. But if you have any type of bump, scar, or flaws on your face, I would suggest avoiding this makeup. This has happened to me so many times with drugstore foundations. That is why I will stick with my Lancome Teint Idole Ultra. Yes, it's a lot more expensive, but it gives me the coverage, finish, and staying power I want. So to me, it's worth the extra money. I went to Sephora and got color matched in the Teint Idole Ultra and was FINALLY able to figure out the correct shade. So I will be sticking with that foundation. I would not repurchase this foundation and wouldn't use it even as a backup.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ZPFNJ05WU7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094G3MRY#wasThisHelpful","R3ZPFNJ05WU7O","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several months ago, I severely damaged my hair by using Not Your Mother's Clean Freak Dry Shampoo. My hair became very dry, brittle, and started falling out. Not enough to really freak me out, but definitely more than normal. I've tried numerous product since then to restore and repair my hair.  I've tried several different products, but haven't found one that really made a major difference.First, I tried Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Deeeep Conditioner, which worked great for awhile, but then quit working. Next, I tried Garnier Hydra Recharge Deep Conditoner. It made my hair soft, but didn't do much to repair the damage. I also tried Neutrogenia Triple Moisture Daily Deep Conditioner. Even though this made my hair silky and shiny, once again, it didn't do much of anything in terms of repairing the damage.Yesterday, I was at Sally's Beauty. I'd done some research on deep conditioners from there, and wanted to try one out. I was looking around when I stumbled across their Generic Value Products Collection. This collection includes a variety of hair care products including shampoo, conditioner, gel, hairspray, and a couple different deep conditioners. This line are basically generic versions of high end salon products like Redkin, Paul Mitchell, and Matrix. I purchased a 6 oz tube for about $4.50. It lists the ingredients for the Paul Mitchell version and the Generic version right on the tube. The ingredients are identical.I used it for the first time this morning, and I noticed a major improvement in my hair after just one use. My hair looks and feels more healthy. You only need a very small amount. This is a very thick conditioner. I thought it might be really hard to rinse out, but it wasn't at all. I was also afraid it would weigh down my hair and make it look gross and greasy. But it didn't at all. I would NEVER pay for the Paul Mitchell version, but with this gem, I don't need to. You get basically the same product for a fraction of the price. I highly recommend this conditioner to anyone who has dry, damaged hair. It truly is amazing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XSAGT74CLZYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003N8SMMY#wasThisHelpful","R2XSAGT74CLZYE","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, let me say that I am not at all acne prone. I can count on one hand the number of pimples I've had in my life.  But a couple months ago, I developed some pretty big whiteheads. I think it may have been from a crappy foundation. At the time they developed, I was trying various different drugstore foundations. So it could have been any one of them. I'm not sure which one. But I had quite a few whiteheads. I had one on my right cheek, a cluster of four on my forehead, and another cluster of 4 on the very top of my forehead, just under my hairline. I tried several different products to try to get rid of the whiteheads, but nothing really worked. I tried Clean and Clear Acne Spot Treatment (salicylic acid) a tea tree oil cream, and Neutrogena On the Spot Acne Treatment (Benzoyl Peroxide) I used them all 2-3 times a day, for over a month, but there was no change in my whiteheads. I was getting frustrated and discouraged.I work as a cashier. I recently had a customer come through my line and buy this Zit Zapper. She asked me if I'd ever tried it, and told me a friend of hers swears by it. I told her I'd never tried it. I know we sell quite a bit of it though. I had some time to kill after work, and my curiosity got the better of me. I decided to buy some. I had very low expectations. My skin is extremely sensitive and very allergy-prone. I figured I'd use it once, have an allergic reaction, and end up tossing it in the trash. But then I realized, I didn't have anything to lose. After all, it only costs $1. So if it ended up in the trash, it's not like I'd be out a lot of money.Here is how I apply it. First, I completely remove my makeup. Then I roll the product on to my fingertip and spread a thin layer on the whiteheads. I let it dry, (which takes only a few seconds) and then apply a second layer. I apply it just before I go to bed, so it has a chance to soak in and do it's thing.I've been using this for about 3 days now. It is AMAZING! The cluster of whiteheads just below my hairline is almost completely gone. The cluster on my forehead and the one on my cheek, have also shrunk significantly. I think it will take only one or two more treatments before they are gone completely. I see and feel improvement every time I use it. I've also used this after cleansing my face after my shower. I use it under my primer and foundation. It dries clear, so no one even knows I have it on.My skin tolerates this product really well. I haven't had ANY problems at all as far as irritation or allergic reactions. In addition to being sensitive and allergy prone, my skin is also extremely oily. The Clean and Clear Acne Spot Treatment caused a slight burning sensation. It didn't do much to shrink my whiteheads, but it definitely caused the surrounding skin to become very dry and flaky. But I didn't have either of those issues with this Zit Zapper.I've read a lot of reviews where the smell seems to be an issue for a lot of people. People have commented that it smells terrible, but it's not an issue for me. In fact, I rather like the smell. This product doesn't have a lot of complicated ingredients. It contains salicylic acid, witch hazel, and tea tree oil. That's it.As I mentioned earlier, I only rarely get pimples, so I can't really comment on how it works for that. But it has worked wonders on my whiteheads/clogged pores. I hope I don't get any more whiteheads, but if I do, I will definitely use this product again. I have already purchased a second tube, and will continue to repurchase.This is the first E.L.F. product I've ever used. I have to say, I'm very impressed. This product works great and it works quickly. Best of all, it only costs $1! This works better than products that cost more than double the price. Give a try, if you don't like it or it doesn't work for you, you're only out a dollar.I recommend this product for all skin types. It can be used on even the most sensitive skin. Great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10SWYZ232D2GH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD3Q8PY#wasThisHelpful","R10SWYZ232D2GH","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a couple of topics I absolutely HATE hearing sermons on. One is marriage (primarily because I'm single and intend to stay that way) and the other is money.I've heard many sermons on the topic of stewardship, and most of the time, I cringe inwardly the entire time. I've even read a few books on stewardship. I've found that most Christian pastors and authors approach stewardship in one of two ways.First, there is the Prosperity Gospel camp. These folks typically say that God wants all His children to be rich and that financial blessings are the primary way God blesses faithfulness. In my opinion, this teaching doesn't square with the whole of Scripture, especially the teachings of Jesus Himself. It reduces God to a genie. If you send in a large enough donation, pray the right prayer, or claim the right verse, then God has no choice but to bless you financially. If you are poor, it's your own fault because your faith is too weak and you aren't trusting God to provide. Proponents of the Prosperity Gospel also frequently twist Scripture and quote it out of context.On the opposite end of the spectrum are those who try to use guilt and intimidation in regards to stewardship. People of this persuation usally put a lot of emphasis on tithing (giving God the top 10%) and frequently quote Malachi 3:8. It is implied (and sometimes directly stated) that believers who don't tithe are robbing God. If you are bold enough to question, why you should tithe, you will probably not get a straight answer. You will probably just be told the Bible commands it and that's it. But in my opinion, it's not quite that simple. I believe that it is possible for someone to tithe regularly out of less than pure motives. It can lead to legalism. Just because a person tithes doesn't necessarily mean a person has a right attitude and heart towards money. There are many non-believers who are far more generous with their money than a lot of Christians. It's sad, but true.This book manages to avoid both of these pitfalls. Andy Stanley is definitely NOT a prosperity preacher. But he also doesn't restore to guilt-trips to motivate people to give. Instead, he focuses on an issue that is almost completely neglected when it comes to finances. Fear. Andy Stanley asserts (and I completely agree) that the main reason many (if not most) Christians don't give generously isn't pride or selfishness, but fear. In this current econonmy, many people are struggling to afford essentials like food, rent, and gas. They are just barely able to make ends meet as it is. It seems impossible and unfair to be expected to give when you can barely afford the true necessities. I can't speak for anyone else, but I know this is very true in my case. I often feel torn. I want to be generous and give, but I feel like I can't because I can't afford my own apartment, groceries, or a car, gas and insurance. I am living paycheck to paycheck, with very little left over.But rather than emphasizing the importance of the tithe, the basis for Andy Stanley's teaching is found in another portion of Scripture all together. It is found in 2nd Corinthians 9:7 (NIV) Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.The Lord has definitely been stretching me in the area of giving and stewardship. He has been challenging me to step out of my comfort zone. He has also challenged me to change my attitude and thinking in regards to money and how I spend it. This is an area where I really struggle. But I know I am not alone. I think there are many Christians who struggle in the area of finances. But they are afraid to speak up.Guilt will only motivate people to give for so long. Eventually, they will get fed up and just say forget it. A person who truly wants to be generous must allow God to truly change their heart and attitude towars money. It won't happen overnight, but it will happen if they allow God to truly transform their heart and mind.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is new to the subject to stewardship or to anyone who is fed up with the two extremes I mentioned above. I also recommend any of the other books by Andy Stanley. He writes in a way that is convicting and thought-provoking, yet practical and easy to understand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMGTVY1U5EVK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NXD2HG#wasThisHelpful","RMGTVY1U5EVK7","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yesterday, I had some time before work and went into Sephora to repurchase my Makeup Forever Mat Velvet, because I didn't want to run out. The SA who checked me out, asked if she could get me a sample of anything. I asked for a sample of this.  According to my Color IQ number (1Y07) I was matched to shade 2.2, so that's the one I requested a sample of.To be honest, there isn't a whole lot I liked about this foundation.COLOR: The color was good in terms of not being too light or too dark. But I think this foundation is definitely geared towards people with yellowish undertones. My skin is light-medium with cool undertones. As a result, this foundation looked very yellow on me.COVERAGE: Other reviewers have stated this is a medium to full coverage foundation. I don't agree. In my opinion, this gives light to barely medium coverage. Definitely not as good as my Makeup Forever Mat Velvet. I also found this foundation extremely difficult to blend. I like fast drying foundations, but this one dries crazy fast. I mean, it touches your skin and it's dry.  No matter how hard I tried to blend it, it just wouldn't cooperate. It never really absorbed into my skin. It just kind of sat on the surface. It also didn't do much of anything in terms of covering up the redness. Even worse, it settled into and emphasized every bump on my face and made them even more noticeable. Definitely NOT what I was going for. BUILDABLE: I don't think this foundation is buildable AT ALL. One layer doesn't cover much of anything, but applying more than one layer is a recipe for disaster. Trying to build this up even a little bit results in it looking thick, heavy, cakey and VERY unnatural.DURABILITY-I can't really say if this foundation stays on 15 hours or not. I only had it on about 10 minutes tops. It took me 3x as long to apply my makeup, and I absolutely hated the results when I was done. It looked like a mask. Definitely not the look I was going for. In fact, I would have been embarassed to wear this foundation in public. There was no way I was going to work looking like that. So I removed this foundation and reapplied the Mat Velvet.BOTTOM LINE: I'm glad I gave this foundation a try. But I'm also VERY glad I got a sample as opposed to splurging on a full-sized bottle right off the bat. In my opinion, this foundation is just not worth the extra money. I will not be purchasing a full-size bottle of this. I am very happy with the results I get from the Mat Velvet and intend to stick with that.I would recommend this foundation for people with yellowish skin tones and flawless skin. But if you have cool (reddish) undertones and any type of scar, bump, or fine lines, I would not recommend this foundation. I highly recommend the Mat Velvet, however.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R157CQF0I14DEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EQONN0#wasThisHelpful","R157CQF0I14DEK","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My skin is extremely oily and extremely allergy prone. As the result of a genetic disease, I have a lot of redness and small bumps on my face. Both of which make me extremely self-conscious. I've tried so many different liquid foundations, and have been disappointed with them all. Either they faded away into oblivion after about 4 hours, (even with primer)didn't give me the coverage I was looking for (medium to full) or looked heavy, cakey, and unnatural.A couple months ago, I decided to try the Color IQ system at Sephora. They use a really tiny camera to take pictures of your face, neck, and cheeks. Then it is entered into a computer and you are given a 4 digit number. Mine is Y107. You can then use this number to find your shade in any foundation Sephora carries. I was skeptical, but the foundations I've tried based on my number have been perfect matches.For trying the Color IQ, you also recieve two free foundation samples. The two I were given was Hourglass Immaculate Liquid Powder foundation and this one. The Hourglass was good as far as shade, but I really didn't like it.I was also given a sample of this foundaiton. I'd been wanting to try this foundation for awhile, but didn't want to commit to a full-sized bottle before I knew if I liked it. According to my Color IQ number, my shade is 35 Vanilla. When I first saw it in the sample cup, I was concerned it would be too light. But once I applied it, it was a perfect match. In fact, I don't think I've ever used another foundation that matched as well as this one does. I love everything about this foundation. It is easy to apply (I apply it with my fingers) a little goes a long way, it lasts all day, does a good job of controlling oil, and gives me a natural, flawless finish. It gives me that ""my skin only better"" look I was after. It is very buildable. I never have to worry about it looking cakey or too heavy. It also covers everything I want covered. I finish with a light dusting of loose powder, and I'm good to go.I did end up returning this foundation because I thought I was allergic to it. Shortly after I purchased a full-sized bottle, I started itching. So I returned the foundation. But the itching didn't stop, in fact, it got progressively worse. I finally realized it wasn't this foundation I was allergic to, and immediately repurchased it. It turn out I was actually allergic to the L'oreal Damage Erasing Balm I was using on my hair. I stopped using it and the itching went away.There are a few things I don't like about this foundation, two of them I can live with, but the third is a deal breaker. First, I don't like the bottle it comes in. First, it's very small. I wish you got a little more product for the price, but it's the standard 1 oz. You only need a little, so the bottle lasts a long time. I've been using it daily for over two months, and I'm still on my first bottle. I also don't like that the bottle isn't see through. It makes it a bit challenging to see how much is left in the bottle. If these were the only issues, I would repurchase this foundation in a heartbeat.But my biggest complaint with this foundation is that it turns into a slimy, greasy mess on the areas where I'm most oily (my nose, area around my nose, and my chin) after about 5 hours. I even tried using it with an oil absorbing primer to see if that would make a difference. It didn't. Which is a shame, because this foundation looks amazing all day on my forehead and cheeks (where I'm somewhat less oily) But it looks and feels awful on the areas where I'm most oily. I did purchase a second bottle of this, but I think I'm going to return it. If you are only moderately oily, you will probably love this foundation. But if you are super oily, then you will want to avoid this foundation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35MMQFA74XEOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N97T2U#wasThisHelpful","R35MMQFA74XEOP","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cannot  think of a more ironically named foundation that this. This foundation is definitely NOT infallable in my opinion. In fact, I would say this is THE WORST foundation I have ever used.  I am trying to find a drugstore foundation that will get me through the next week or so until I can purchase the MAC Matchmaster, which is currently out of stock in my shade. After a major disaster with Maybelline Fit Me Foundation, I decided to give this foundation a try. I'd read online that it was good for people with oily skin. I also had a coupon for Ulta for $3.50 off a $10 purchase. So I used (or should I say wasted) it on this foundation. I purchased this in Shade 613 True Beige. I usually need more of a natural beige, but this foundation seems to run light. I could tell just by looking at it that the Natural Beige was going to be way too light. The lady at Ulta suggested the True Beige and I agreed. With my coupon, I paid 9.96 for this foundation. I tried it for the first time this morning.I like the pump. That's pretty much the only thing I liked about this foundation.This foundation is very thick. The first time I tried to squirt some out, the only thing that came out was some light brown water. So I shook it and tried it again. Still really runny and watery. I shook it again and it finally came out decent.This definitely is NOT a lightweight foundation. If you are looking for a liquid foundation that will give you a natural look, this is definitely not it. It is  thick and heavy even when it is wet, even more so when it dries. This is not a makeup that you apply and forget its on. You can definitely feel it on your face. If you have any flaws at all, this makeup will do nothing except magnify them. I remember wearing clown makeup as a kid for Halloween one year. That is pretty much what this makeup feels like on your face. It is also very cakey. It is  difficult to spread and blend. It is also not at all buildable.  This is a case of you cannot win no matter what you do. If you apply a thin layer, the coverage is very sheer. If you try to build it up, it looks cakey, unnatural, and pretty much  awful.At first, I thought I had  a good color match. When the foundation was wet, it seemed fine.  But once it dried and was on awhile, it turned very orange. I cannot really comment on the staying power of this makeup, because I could only stand to have it on my face for a little over an hour. I could not wait to take it off. I really had to scrub to get it off. After I completely removed this foundation, my face felt sticky. I tried using water to get rid of it, but that didn't work. I ended up using my Clinique Foaming Face wash before applying different makeup. The bottom line is this: Don't waste your time or money on this foundation.For drugstore foundations, I recommend Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte. For high end, I recommend MAC Matchmaster or Makeup Forever Mat Velvet.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IY989O6MQMHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DO51HE#wasThisHelpful","R2IY989O6MQMHA","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second worst foundation I have ever used. I purchased this because MAC is currently sold out of my shade of the Matchmaster. My sample was running out, and I needed something to hold me over until my next payday.  have no idea  where to start regarding the things I hate  about this foundation. I bought this because it was relatively cheap, and I wanted to give it a try. Finding the right shade was really tricky. There is a little paper shade chart, but it is pretty much useless. It does not at all resemble the actual shade of the makeup.First, it comes in a glass bottle without a pump. The glass bottle does not  bother me, but the lack of a pump kind of does. Even though I shook it before I applied it, it still came out very watery and runny. You waste a lot of product.I also did not like the way this foundation felt on my face. Even though it comes out of the bottle very watery and runny, it looks and feels very thick and heavy on your face. This foundation also does not  dry very quickly. It never really absorbed into my skin either. It just kind of sat on the surface, making me look and feel like I was wearing a mask. Even after it dries, this foundation looks slimy and wet. Definitely not attractive.Third, this foundation provides almost no coverage. It is very sheer. If you need only very light coverage and have flawless skin (which I definitely do not) this foundation might work for you. But it did nothing to cover the redness on my face at all. It made the small bumps on my face really stand out. Definitely not what I was going for.Fourth, this foundation is not buildable at all. When I tried to build it up just a little, it looked terrible. It looked thick, heavy, gloppy, and not at all natural. It pretty much screamed ""Look, I'm wearing makeup.""When I purchased this foundation, I brought along my sample of the Matchmaster foundation to try to get a good match. I thought I had succeeded. I purchased this in Shade 230 Natural Buff. When I got it home, I applied a small amount to my chest and compared it to the skin on my neck. It looked like a perfect match. But within a few minutes of applying it to my face, it darkened and turned REALLY yellow. In the bottle, it looked like exactly the same color as my Matchmaster foundation.This foundation is NOT for gals with oily skin. I only had this on for about an hour and a half this morning, and I could already see and feel my face getting greasy. Even with MOM underneath, I do not think I would have even gotten 3 hours of decent wear out of this foundation. But I did not  leave it on my face long enough to find out. There was no way I was going to go to work with this stuff on my face. Fortunately, I was able to get one more use out my Matchmaster foundation. I have already purchased a different drugstore foundation to get me through until I can repurchase the Matchmaster. After I took this off, the bottle went where it belongs. Straight into the garbage. I will not be wearing or purchasing this foundation again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PXPXJI9O6QWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004677D8U#wasThisHelpful","R3PXPXJI9O6QWL","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this on a whim after finding it in the clearance bin at Target. I paid $1.04 for it. I have to say, I wasn't really all that impressed.This is a thick, rich creamy conditioner. On the plus side, it didn't give me an allergic reaction, I like the smell, and it didn't weigh my hair down.In my opinion, this is not really a deep conditioner. If you are looking for just a regular conditioner, you will probably really like this product. If, however, you are looking for something to repair dry, damaged hair, this isn't it.If you want  a deep conditioner that really works, I highly recommend Neutrogena Triple Moisture Daily Deep Conditioner. My hair was extremely damaged after I used a dry shampoo for several days in a row, back in March. My hair was dry, brittle, and falling out. Every morning after my shower, I was having to pull hair out of the catch in the drain. But not anymore. The Neutrogena Triple Moisture Daily Deep Conditioner pretty much saved my hair. It leaves my hair shiny, soft, and healthy. I love running my fingers through my hair after using it. I can see and feel a major difference in my hair after using this product. The longer I use it, the better my hair gets.In my opinion, this John Frieda Conditioner simply can't compare to the Neutrogena Triple Moisture Daily Conditioner. I got much better results from that, and intend to keep using it. All things considered, I'm glad I only purchased a travel size. I will not be purchasing a full-sized tube of the John Frieda Full Repair Full Body Conditioner.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BQ7GTFZBDX7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057TF022#wasThisHelpful","R3BQ7GTFZBDX7J","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I work retail, so occassionally, I am scheduled to work at 8:00 a.m. When that happens, I usually take my shower the night before.  My hair is normally pretty oily, so it looks greasy and limp if I don't shampoo it every day. I bought this dry shampoo on a whim. It's relatively cheap, and a fairly big bottle.When I first started using it, I loved the results. It did a good job of controlling the oil and you couldn't even tell I'd washed my hair the night before. I also liked that you got the desired effect using very little product.But then in March, I was scheduled for 8:00 a.m. shifts 5 days in a row. I washed my hair the night before, and then used this dry shampoo before work in the morning. The following week, I noticed a major change in my hair. It became very dry, brittle, and started falling out. When I blow dry my hair, I run my fingers through it as I'm drying it, just to fluff it out a little more. When I would do this, I would find numerous strands between my fingers.  I also started noticing more hair falling out in the shower. Not enough to really freak me out,  but definitely more than normal. My hair started looking like straw, which has NEVER been a problem for me before. I realized it had to be from this dry shampoo. So I stopped using it and threw it in the trash. But the damage was already done to my hair.I tried several deep conditioners, but couldn't find one that repaired the damage and made my hair healthy again.  But then I found Neutrogenia Triple Moisture Daily Deep Conditoner. I had to use about a palmful of product and leave it on for 5 minutes (as opposed to the 1 minute it says on the tube) but the Neutrogenia Deep Conditioner has done a good job of repairing the damage. My hair is soft and looks more healthy than it has in months. It's not 100% restored, but it is very close. I suspect that it will only be a few more days before my hair is back to normal.One final note: A couple days ago, I was on the Ulta website and saw this product there. There is a link where you can view the ingredients. When I saw the ingredients for this dry shampoo, I was absolutely floored. The first 3 ingredients are isobutane, propane, and alcohol. No wonder it fried my hair! Needless to say, I don't recommend this product to anyone, and will definintely NOT repurchase. If you are looking for a GOOD dry shampoo, I suggest the one by Suave Professionals. It comes in a silver bottle with a yellow cap. It's affordable, it works great, and it's gentle. It won't wreck your hair the way this one does.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E7MMCAYSZX8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057NE7NQ#wasThisHelpful","R3E7MMCAYSZX8M","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in March, my hair got majorly fried after using Not Your Mother's Clean Freak Dry Shampoo for about 5 days in a row. Ever since then, I've been trying to find a deep condtioner to repair and restore my hair. My hair is normally very oily, but after using the dry shampoo, it became like straw, very dry, brittle, and was falling out. It wasn't falling out enough to really freak me out, but definitely more than normal. I tried Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Deeep Conditioner, which work great for about two weeks, then quit working. I also tried Infusium 23, which pretty much did nothing. Then I tried Garnier Hydro Recharge, which made my hair very soft, but didn't do much in terms of repairing the damage. I then tried a sample of Matrix Exquisite Oil, which made my scalp burn. Next, I tried Nioxin Scalp Therapy, which burned even worse than the Matrix. In fact, my scalp hurt for the rest of the day after using the Nioxin Conditioner.I was starting to get really discouraged and frustrated. I picked up this product on a whim. I don't remember what I paid, but I think it was around $6.99 for an 8.5 oz tube.  This is a very rich and cream conditioner, but it doesn't weigh down your hair at all. It's very light. I used this daily for about two weeks. Even though it says on the tube you only needed it leave it in for 1 minute, I left it on my hair for 2-3 minutes and then washed it out. It's easy to rinse out and rinses clean. There is no build-up left on your hair. It left my hair very soft,  but it didn't really do much in terms of fixing the damage. Even after using this daily for over 2 weeks, my hair was still damaged, brittle, dry, and falling out. About 3 days ago, I was about to give up and try something else, I decided to give this conditioner one more chance. I did a couple of things different. First, I started using about double the amount of product (about a palmful.) I also decided to try leaving it on my hair just a few minutes longer. I left it on about 5 minutes total. I was afraid that doubling the amount of product might cause my hair to feel weighed down and look greasy. But it didn't. Once I made these two changes, I noticed a major difference in the condition of my hair. It felt very soft and became less dry, brittle and more healthy in general. You could see and feel the difference. This morning was the first time in months, that I haven't had to remove any hair from the drain catch in the shower. My hair is still a tiny bit dry, but no where near what it was. I think within a few days,  my hair will be completely restored and back to normal.EDIT: Even though this has made my hair soft and silky, it hasn't done much of anything in terms of repairing the damage. If I stop using it for even one day, my hair gets dry, brittle, and starts falling out again. I would definitely recommend this as a regular conditioner, but definitely not as a deep conditioner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPFDVEJKN4OBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BCWQIW#wasThisHelpful","RPFDVEJKN4OBD","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been searching for a cheaper alternative to my Pop Beauty Face Magnet primer. I did a Google search and found several websites that mentioned using this as a face primer. I have SUPER allergy-prone skin, and have had really good luck with Aveeno Lotions in the past. I absolutely LOVE the adult version of the Daily Moisturizing Lotion. My hands get very dry and cracked (especially on winter) and the adult version of this lotion heals it within just a couple of days.This lotion is hypoallergic and formulated for sensitive skin, so I thought it was worth a shot. I felt a little silly buying baby lotion because I'm lacking a key component for buying baby lotion (ie a baby) But I got over it and paid less than $6 for an 8.0 oz tube. This lotion fragrance free, hypoallergic, non comedegenic, and oil free. and specially formulated for sensitive/allergy prone skin. I also like that it has a moisturizer already in it.To be completely honest, I was skeptical about using this as a face primer. I really didn't expect it to work. I thought it might make my foundation look heavy and cakey. But incredibly, it didn't. You only need a TINY amount. If you apply too much, it will cause liquid foundation to pill and slide around. It did take a little trial and error to figure out the right amount to use. But here is how I apply it. I squirt a tiny amount into my palm (I used a dot about the size of pencil eraser. That is more than enough for my entire face)then I dip my finger into the lotion and rub it into my skin.  Since you only need such a tiny amount, it absorbs and dries almost instantly. In addition to be extremely allergy-prone, my skin is almost extremely oily. Which let me tell you, is not a good combination. Without primer (and sometimes even WITH a primer) my makeup generally lasts about 4 hours before it starts breaking up and disappearing. By the 5 hour mark, there are large patches of redness and bare skin showing through. By the 6 hour mark, it's pretty much completely gone. I've tried MANY different primers (both drugstore and high end) and have had varying degrees of success. Even primers that work generally only give me about 7  hours of decent wear. Which is better than 4 hours, but it's still not great. I've been hoping to find a primer that will give me at LEAST 10 hours of decent wear from my makeup. I think I have finally found it. I applied my makeup around 9:00 a.m. this morning. It is now a little after 6:30 p.m. My makeup still looks amazing. I am the most oily around my nose and on my cheeks around my nose. Even in the areas where I am super oily, my makeup has only worn away the tiniest bit. I am not one to touch up my makeup. Since you only use such a tiny amount, this tube will last a really long time, which makes it a great value.I feel this lotion has done a great job in terms of controlling oil, keeping me matte, and helping my makeup stay on longer. I'm not sure how it work for someone with dry or combination skin, but for oily skin, it is truly a miracle. I have tried a couple of other cheap alternatives to face primer. Milk of Magnesia and Monistat Anti-Chaffing Gel. The Milk of Magnesia does work and doesn't irritate my skin, but was hesitant about using it long-term. The Monistat Gel didn't do much of anything for me in terms of controlling oil or keeping my makeup on longer. In addition, it also made me itch. I  have tried so many different primers both drugstore and high-end. I haven't found another primer that works as well as this does. It has given me everything I was looking for in a primer. I am suprised how well this actually works as a face primer. If I hadn't read about it online, I would have NEVER thought this could work as a face primer. But it does. If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to face primer, I highly recommend this product. I especially recommend it to people who have very sensitive/allergy prone skin. You can't beat the price and you get a lot of product for the price. I will purchase this again and again. This is now my HG primer, and will never use anything else. Give it a try, you won't be sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MHJ6JW00VU4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00394QA9E#wasThisHelpful","R3MHJ6JW00VU4H","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been hunting for a good affordable primer that will help control oil and keep my makeup in place longer. I do really like the Pop Beauty Face Magnet Primer. But it costs $26. Since my foundation is $35, I wanted to find a slightly cheaper primer. I tried a couple, but didn't really like them. Then I saw this at Ulta. I've read positive reviews about this product before, and read that it worked really well for oily skin. It was $16 at Ulta. The packaging has changed. Rather than a squat plastic container, it now comes in a tube with a pump. They also increased the size from 1 oz to 1.4 oz. I know that the Iman line is intended for women of color (which I am not) so I was a little concerned about this caramel color of this primer. But I used a tester on the back of my hand before purchasing it. It dried super fast and dried clear. It is so lightweight and feels wonderful. This tube should last a long time, because you only need a tiny bit of this primer. I used about a dime-sized amount for my entire face. This primer dries almost instantly. My skin is super oily and very allergy prone. But this primer didn't irritate my sensitive skin, and I feel it did a very good job of controlling the oil. Without primer, (and sometimes even with primer) my makeup looks decent for about 4-5 hours before it starts breaking down and disappearing. With this primer, I had only minor breakthrough at the 8 hour mark. I think I have finally found my HG primer. This is a wonderful primer for $16 dollars. Very few primers that I've tried actually work with my skin. Either they don't control the oil very well, or they give me an allergic reaction. This primer one of the best I've ever used, and I will definitely repurchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MWFZIAMB5IOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KYTRFY#wasThisHelpful","R1MWFZIAMB5IOX","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am just about out of my Pop Beauty Face Magnet primer. I love it, but since I splurge my foundation, I wanted to try to find a cheaper primer that will work. Over the last few weeks, I've tried a few different ones, but didn't really like any of them. I orginally went to Sally's to purchase the Claudia Stevens Facial Prep Foundation Base (the one in the white tube) but they were out of stock. At first, I was just going to forget it. But then I went back and decided to give this one a try. This product comes in a green tube. It cost me $5.79. To be honest, I didn't really have high hopes for this primer. I was also skeptical about the anti-redness claim. But I figured it was worth a shot. If I hated it, I was only out about $6.I have to admit that when I first saw the color of this primer, it freaked me out a little. It is a VERY dark green color. But it's a light, gel-like consistancy. It does feel a little weird when you first apply it, but it dries really fast and turns clear. It is very easy to apply, and a little goes a long way. I have quite a bit of redness on my face, and this primer definitely did tone it down quite a bit. It also made my Makeup Forever Mat Velvet foundation glide on. It feels so lightweight, you can't even tell you have anything on. It blurred the imperfections on my face and made it look flawless. My skin is extremely oily and extremely allergy prone. I really expected it to disappear after about 4 or 5 hours. But it didn't. I applied my makeup around 8:30 this morning. As I write this, it is now a little after 7 in the evening. My foundation has started to wear away very slightly on my nose, but no where near what I've had with other primers. It also doesn't irritate my extremely sensitive skin. This primer did a great job of controlling the oilness and kept my face matte all day. That is HUGE for me!My only complaint is that its a very small tube of product. But at less than $6 a pop, I can live with that.EDIT: 10/12/13This is yet another example of the old adage ""You get what you pay for."" I really this primer the first couple of times I used it. But then I started to notice it was changing the consistency of my foundation. Makeup Forever Mat Velvet is not a thick foundation. At least it wasn't until I started wearing it over this primer. My liquid foundation became thicker and became more like a cream foundation. I usually have no problems whatsover getting my Mat Velvet to absorb into my skin. But when I used it over this primer, my foundation started slipping and sliding around. It also never really absorbed into my skin. It just kind of sat on the surface. In addition, my foundation would ball up. Once my foundation set completely (which takes about an hour) it looked even worse. Normally, the Mat Velvet looks very natural and flawless on my face. You can't even hardly tell I'm wearing makeup. But this primer made my foundation look thick, heavy, and cakey. I applied the same amount I always have. It basically made my $35, high-end foundation look like a cheap drugstore foundation. This primer obviously does not play well AT ALL with liquid foundation. Maybe it would work better with a powder or mineral foundation. I'm not really sure. I have been really happy with the Mat Velvet up to this point, and see no reason to switch. More than likely, this primer is going to end up in the garbage. I recently started using the Iman Undercover Agent Oil Free Primer, and like that much better. I wouldn't recommend this primer to anyone who wears liquid foundation. I will not repurchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RW61H3VW1ZL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DA02M8#wasThisHelpful","R2RW61H3VW1ZL5","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been searching for a long-lasting, full coverage, lightweight foundation for a long time. I tried Amazonian Clay. It lasted all day and provided great, flawless coverage, but it was much too cakey and powdery for my liking. After returning the Amazonian Clay, I decided to swing by Macy's. I had a card for a free consultation and a 10 day supply of any foundation. So I felt like I had nothing to lose, so I took advantage of that. The girl who did the consultation told me my shade is Dusk (3C1) After applying this foundation, she asked me what I thought. I wasn't exactly sure how to respond. The girl did a great job applying it, I just wasn't crazy about how it looked on my face. Shortly after my consultation at Estee Lauder, I bought a bottle of Boots No 7 Double Wear Beautifully Matte. I've been using that for a little less than a week now, and I absolutely love it. I decided today to try the free sample of Double Wear.This makeup just isn't for me. Even though the girl who applied this for me told me it was full-coverage, I don't agree. I think the coverage is closer to medium than full. It also didn't give me a very flawless finish. It did an okay job of covering up the redness, but you can still clearly see the bumpiness underneith this makeup. I also don't like the way this makeup looks on my face. It doesn't look very natural in my opinion. You can definitely tell I am wearing makeup. I also have some very fine lines. So fine you can't even see them with the naked eye. But after applying this makeup you can see them clear as day. I'm also not sure this is the right shade for me. You can clearly see where the makeup has been applied to my skin. My skin is light/medium with cool undertones. My skin isn't fair, but it definitely on the light side. I think a shade or two lighter might have worked out better. I also agree with a previous reviewer who said this is like applying paint to your face. That is pretty much what it looks like when its dry.This foundation is too matte for my liking as well. It looks cakey and thick on your face.  But I also think that I'm allergic to something in this product. Ever since I applied it this morning, my face has been itching. It's enough to be distracting. I also found this makeup very difficult to remove. It took a lot of scrubbing.When I compare the two, there is simply no comparison between this and the Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte.  The Beautifully Matte foundation provides full, yet natural looking coverage, contains sunscreen, is oil free and hypoallergenic. It lasts until I take it off at night. It also gives my face a smooth, flawless finish. It covers both the bumps and the redness very well. Even better, the Beautifully Matte is much more affordable. It sells for $13.99 as opposed to a rather pricey $36.99 for the Double Wear. Who would have thought that I'd prefer a drugstore foundation over a high-end one? Certainly not me. But in my opinion, the Beautifully Matte is superior to the Double Wear. I will not be purchasing a full-sized bottle of the Double Wear. I'm glad I tried it out, but no thanks. I'll stick with my Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte foundation.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GHGW6VEY4H7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027BGEGY#wasThisHelpful","R2GHGW6VEY4H7Q","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been trying for a long time to find a foundation that will do what I want to. I tried the Amazonian Clay Full Cover 12 hour foundation. It felt light on my face and covered great, but it was much too cakey for my liking. Needless to say I was disappointed. I got a free sample of Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation. The shade matched perfectly and I loved the way it looked and felt on my face. What I wasn't so crazy about was the price. $36 for a foundation is definitely a splurge for me. I would have spent it if I had to, but I wanted to see if I could find something a little more affordable that would have the same staying power and look. After getting the free sample from Macy's, I suddenly remembered that Boots No 7 was available at Target. So on a whim, I decided to see if I could find it. I wasn't exactly sure what shade I needed, but I thought that the Cool Beige looked about right for my skintone. I have light/medium skin.  I have a lot of imperfections on my face that I want to cover up (bumps, redness, and huge pores) To be honest, I really didn't expect much at all from this foundation. I've tried countless other drug store foundations in the same price range. They either didn't give me the level of coverage I wanted or faded away after just a few hours. Even though this foundation claimed to last 14 hours, I was more than a little skeptical. I've tried foundations that claimed to last 16 or 24 hours before and found they didn't even come close to lasting that long on my face. Most of the time, I was lucky if I could give 5 hours of decent wear.  But for 13.50, I decided to give this a chance. I also bought some of the Boots ""Expert Anti-Redness serum) for 7.99 (also from Target) What drew me to this foundation was that it claimed to be full coverage, long-lasting, and hypoallergenic. It is also oil free. I have extremely sensitive skin as well. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this product has a pump. I know some people don't like the pump, but I love it. In my opinion, the pump  makes it so much easier to get the amount you need without getting it all over the place. I apply it first with a sponge and then just a tiny bit with a brush. It looks amazing. A little bit of this goes a long way, I know this bottle will last at least 3 months.The following day, after cleansing my face in the shower, applying the redness serum and a moisturizer, I applied this make-up. It is super easy to apply. It doesn't feel heavy on your face at all. The coverage is wonderful. It doesn't feel cakey or overly powdery at all. It looks very natural. The Cool Beige is a perfect match for my skin. It looked great all day. It doesn't rub off and it stayed on until I removed it before bed.Today, I got stuck in a minor rainstorm. I went for a short walk. When I left, it was just lightly sprinkling. But it started raining a little harder as I walked. I had my hood up, but I could still feel the rain hitting my face. I expected my foundation to look awful by the time I got to the store. I went to the bathroom and found it still looked amazing. A short time later, back at home, I realized that I was overheating from wearing too warm of a shirt.  I started to sweat like crazy. I had beads of sweat on my forehead and running down my face. I took a paper towel and blotted my face. I expected to see a ton of foundation on the paper towel as well. But there was NOTHING! Not even a little bit of it came off. I was surprised and delighted. All for 13.50. This foundation has given me everything I was looking for. I will probably try the Double Wear, but I won't be buying it. This is my new go-to foundation. If you are looking for a lightweight, full-coverage, long-lasting liquid foundation, I highly recommend this product. If you purchase this product, I promise you won't be sorry.  I will definitely buy this again. I also highly recommend the Expert Anti-Redness serum. It feels great on your skin and I have noticed a decrease in the redness on my forehead and nose since I've started using it. I can't say enough good things about this foundation.

"Amazonian Clay Full Coverage 12 hour foundationI have a lot of issues when it comes to my face. I have a lot of redness and bumpiness on my cheeks and chin. Even though the bumpiness isn't an issue on my nose and forehead, redness definitely is. I very seldom get acne, but I would describe my skin as oily, especially on my nose and cheeks. In addition, I also have very sensitive skin. I have to be really careful about what chemicals I put on my face. I have had used a couple of products that made my face feel like it was on fire. I've had many more that caused me to itch like crazy. Even though I always purchase products that are hypoallergenic or made specifically for sensitive skin, a lot of them still make me itch.I have tried many different types of foundation. I have tried some very cheap ones (NYC and Hard Candy) I have also tried most of the mid-priced store brands (Loreal, Maybelline, Merle Norman, Avon, and Mary Kay. I've even used a Clinique foundation. But regardless of how much I pay or where I purchase it, the result is always the same. It looks great when I first apply it, but after a short time, (generally 4 hours or less) the shine and redness start peeking through again. I had almost given up hope. I started to think that maybe my expectations for a foundation were unrealistic. Obviously, things like oil-free and suitable for sensitive skin are important, but for me, the three things I was most looking for were1. Lightweight2. Full, yet natural coverage3 Long lastingThe amount I've been spending on foundation has slowly been creeping up, so I decided maybe it was time to consider a high-end foundation. I spent about 3 days researching different foundations and reading reviews. Finally, I narrowed it down to 4 I was interested in trying. This product was the most expensive of the 4. This foundation is somewhat pricey,  so I didn't want to invest in a foundation I wasn't even sure I was going to like. I read a lot of positive reviews of this foundation online,  but honestly, I was skeptical. It just seemed too good to be true. Rather than shelling out the money for a full tube right away, I decided to see if I could somehow get a free sample. I felt a little silly. But I went to Sephora and asked if they did free samples of foundation. I expected the lady to laugh at me, but she was very nice. She said ""That's not a crazy question at all. We are actually really big on samples. You can sample any product in the store.""  I also explained that I wasn't exactly sure what shade I needed. She said she would help me with that as well. I thought I needed either needed Medium or Light Medium. It turns out that the Light Medium was a perfect match to my skin. I was given a very generous free sample and couldn't wait to try it. But I was also nervous. I'd felt disappointed with so many other cosmetics, that I didn't really expect anything else from this product. Online reviews recommended applying it with a brush, so I purchased a cheap make-up brush and applied it that way.After applying this product for the first time, I was blown away when I looked in the mirror. It covered the bumps and redness completely, given me a flawless, natural look.  It also feels incredibly light on my face. It feels like my natural skin, not cakey or like I'm wearing a mask. But I knew the real test was still to come: How long would it last? Some previous reviewers did state that this foundation didn't last 12 hours, so I was a little worried. But I figured even if it lasted 8 hours it was an improvement over other products. I applied this product the first day at about 7 am. It still looked great when I removed it at around 10:30 that night. It hadn't faded or worn off at all. I was little concerned that this product might be difficult to remove. But a make-up remover wipe removed it with no problem whatsoever.Update 4-4-13When I first got the sample of this product and started using it, I loved it. I thought I had found my go-to foundation. So I purchased a full-sized tube. But the longer I used it, the less I liked it. This foundation doesn't feel heavy on your face, but it does get very cakey and powdery when it dries. I also found it difficult to apply evenly. In some places, I would get it too thin and in others too thick. It also wore off where I am most oily (my cheeks and especially my nose.) I also started to notice that this foundation rubs off very easily. One day I was trying on shirts. I was wearing a turtleneck and a tee-shirt. When I pulled my turtleneck up over my head, I immediately noticed that I had a good amount of foundation on the inside of my turtleneck. I felt less and less confident in this foundation as time went on. I also wasn't crazy sbout the texture of this foundation. It's kind of weird. It's somewhere between a liquid and a cream. I realized that I prefer a liquid foundation. I also want something that will cover well yet will blend into my skin. Previous reviews have mentioned they didn't think the coverage of this makeup wasn't matte enough. In my opinion, the coverage of this makeup is much too matte for my liking.I would recommend getting a free sample of this product, and trying it at least a week before buying a full-sized tube. I would also recommend getting matched at a place like Sephora or Ulta so you are sure to get the right shade. I can definitely understand why there are so many positive reviews for this product. It lives up to its promises and offers great coverage. But I realized I had been hasty in purchasing a full-sized tube. I ultimately ended up returning the full-sized tube. This just wasn't the right foundation for me.In my opinion, a much better alternative to this product is Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte. It is available at Target and online for around $14.00 It is hypoallergenic, oil free, contains sunscreen, stays on all day, and is very lightweight. It provides full coverage, yet looks very sheer. It doesn't look heavy or artificial at all. It is also sweatproof. I started sweating like crazy recently while wearing this makeup. I blotted my face with a papertowel. I expected to see a ton of my foundation on the paper towel as well. But there was NOTHING! It still looked great! It has given me everything I was looking for at a fraction of the price of Amazonian Clay and Estee Lauder Double Wear. When choosing a shade, realize they they come in pairs. There are two choices each for light, medium and deep. The first shade in the pair is for warm tones and the second is for cool tones. Warm skintones tend to have yellow undertones. Cool skintones tend to have pinkish undertones. In my opinion, the best way to determine your skin tone is to look at the veins in your wrist. If they appear greenish, then you have a warm skin tone. If they look bluish, then you have a cool skintone. If you can't tell, then you have neutral skin tones. Most people tend to have warm skintones. But I discovered that I have cool skintones. So I chose to purchase the shade ""Cool Beige"" It was a perfect match for my skin. Give the Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte a try. I promise you won't be disappointed. A great product for a great price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WP4NYEC22BY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006W3P14Y#wasThisHelpful","R2WP4NYEC22BY9","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been struggling for a long time for a foundation that will do what I want to do. I have a genetic disease that has left me with a red, bumpy rash on my face. I am very self-conscious about it, and I would like to find a foundation that will cover it yet still look natural. But I've tried countless different foundations. Either they don't provide enough coverage or fade after only a few hours. I also have very sensitive skin. So I want something that offers good coverage and yet is light. I don't want to feel like I'm wearing a mask.After reading glowing reviews of this product, I went over to Wal-Mart and bought some for $6. I'm glad I didn't pay more for this product. I was excited to try it and tried applying it as soon as I got it home. It was HORRIBLE! The texture is very thick. It looked and felt like mud. I even tried thinning it out by rubbing it with my fingers. Even that didn't help.  Once I put it on my face, it felt greasy and sticky. Worst of all, it settled into the bumps on my face. Rather than camoflaging them, it made them stand out even more. Definitely NOT what I was I looking for. I had to wash my hands with soap and water 3 times before I got this stuff off my fingers. But even that didn't get rid of it completely. When I got up the next morning, I noticed I still had traces of this make-up on my fingertips. Yuck. Needless to say, this foundation went where it belongs: in the garbage. There is no way I would wear this make-up out in public. I guess this is a perfect example of the truth of the old saying ""You get what you pay for."" In my opinion, this product is nothing but a huge waste of money. Don't waste your precious time or money on this product.If you are willing to pay for a higher end foundation, I would recommend Amazonian Clay 12 hour full-coverage foundation. It feels very light on your face, gives you great, long-lasting, full coverage, and looks totally natural. Yes it is a bit pricey, but it is worth every penny in my opinion.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EINUU41IAD1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JPBFBY#wasThisHelpful","R3EINUU41IAD1P","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw this cookbook available on Amazon Vine, I was very excited to receive it. I am following Weight Watchers and am always on the lookout for light, easy, and satisfying recipes. I am able to adapt regular recipes with no problem, but it is always nice to find recipes that don't need to be adapted as well. When I paged through this book, I was excited. There were quite a few recipes that I was anxious to try. However, when I got out my points calculator, I was significantly less enthusiastic. I think the title of this book is very misleading. Most of the recipes in this book can hardly be called light. Even the lightened versions have pretty high stats for fat. (Most of the recipes have between 10-20 grams of fat per serving). But even more shocking is the carb stats. Weight Watchers is not a low-carb diet, but carbs can definitely negatively affect the point value for a meal or food. Generally, the higher the carbs, the higher the point value. There were recipes in this book (and not just a few) that had carbs in the 50's, 60s, 70s, and 80s. One recipe for a Chocolate milkshake had a whopping 98g of carbs! That is just crazy.In my opinion, a much better cookbook would be ""Hungry Girl to the Max"". It features many of the same recipes with much more reasonable stats and larger serving sizes. Here is a brief comparison of very simliar recipes from both cookbooks.Chicken MarsalaAmerica's Test Kitchen-WW PointsPlus Value of 9Hungry Girl to the Max-WW PointsPlus Value of 5 for half of the recipeOven Baked ChickenAmerica's Test Kitchen-(serving size 2 pieces) WW PointsPlus Value of 11Hungry Girl to the Max-(serving size 8 pieces)with a WW PointsPlus Value of 7Chocolate MilkshakeAmerica's Test Kitchen-WW PointsPlus Value of 13 (!)Hungry Girl to the Max-WW PointsPlus Value of 5Warm Chocolate Fudge CakesAmerica's Test Kitchen-(serving size 1 cake) WW PointsPlus Value of 11Hungry Girl to the Max-Chocolate Lava Cake WW PointsPlus Value of 5 (per cake)I really wanted to give this book a glowing recommendation, but I can't.

"In 2006, I got a degree in Medical Transcription. I loved it and couldn't wait to find a job. But it never panned out. Just a few short months after graduating, voice recognition software arrived on a the scene basically elimating the need for transcriptionists. I also found it frustrating that it is next to impossible to get an entry-level transcription job. The few jobs out there require 3-5 years experience. How the heck are you supposed to get experience if no one will hire you and give you the opportunity to prove yourself? But I love the medical field and have wanted to pursue another avenue in the medical field. I just can't imagine myself in a career like nursing, medical assistant, dental assitant or a CNA. It's just not for me. I had a job once in a hospital in insurance verification and absolutely loved it.  Lately, I've been thinking more seriously about going back to school. I have been thinking about getting into coding for several years now. But a program director from a nearby technical college told me that coding is heading in the same direction as Medical Transcription. The last thing I want is to obtain another degree that will soon be rendered obsolete. So I have hesitated about pursuing my interest in medical coding.I recently did a search in the Kindle store and stumbled across this book. I was very impressed by the sample chapters, and decided it was worth the $3.99. I'm so glad I did. This book is written in a conversational, easy to read format. It's is not full or jargon or hard to understand lingo. It is very thorough. It enables the reader to hear from people who are actually in the field. It talks about the importance of certification, the future of coding, job prospects, and how to get educated. It talks about what personality types are suited for a career in coding. For someone like me, who had little to no real understanding about what medical coding is and what the job actually entails, this book is invaluable. After reading this book, I feel much more confident about pursuing a career in coding. It put a lot of my fears and hesitations to rest. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a indepth overview of what it really is like to work in the field of medical coding. If you are wondering if a career in medical coding is for you, do yourself a favor, and get a copy of this book. You won't be sorry","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFLJ8XJ5YPJ49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEZ00ZA#wasThisHelpful","RFLJ8XJ5YPJ49","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I stumbled across this book in the free bestt sellers list on my Kindle a couple of days ago. The title immediately caught my attention. However, I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical. I thought this book would be geared towards a six figure income and presigious lines of work. But I was very pleasantly surprised. Mr. Churchill talks about how better skills and more income means something different to everyone. For Mr. Churchill, it means finding a job that gave him more freedom, more opportunity to be creative, more recognition, and better relationships with co-workers. For me, it would be a job with a 40 hour workweek and higher pay that would enable me to afford things like my own apartment, a car, and some extras.  For other people, it may mean 5K more a year or 50K a year. For some, it might mean starting your own business. Mr. Churchill discusses in detail how to figure out what skills you want to learn, how to identify (and fix) the problems in your current position and really makes you think. He teaches you how to ask the right questions and that gives you assistance in finding the answers. He gives you a step by step process for learning new skills on your own, online tutorials, finding a mentor, and even FREE online college courses. This is a book you will want to read with a highligher in hand. I would also recommend taking notes. There is a lot of great information in here. He gives the reader a ton of links and resources.I have been frustrated in my career for a long time now. I'm unhappy and barely earn enough to pay my expenses, much less many extras. But I'm very gun-shy about going back to school. I can't afford to take time off of work and really don't want to incur even more student loan debt. I have to admit, before reading this book, I had almost given up hope. I know my skills are out of date, but I didn't know any way to improve them except going back to school. Now, I have hope that there truly is another way that really is legit and makes sense to me. If you feel trapped in a dead-end job and feel like you are out of options, do yourself a favor and read this book. Even though this book is no longer free, it is very reasonably priced and well worth the money. This is book is one to read slowly, really think about, and then apply. Thank you Mr. Churchill for writing this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7TJCW56NNV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AUM28IA#wasThisHelpful","R2F7TJCW56NNV5","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit, I was both nervous and excited about receiving this item. In fact, I was tempted to cancel this order and get something else. But I should have stuck with my insticts on this one. I received this item and tried one. I took a little bit and did manage (barely) to swallow it. I tried to eat the rest of the chew and just couldn't do it. I ended up spitting the rest of it. I very much doubt that I will be eating anymore of these chews. They are supposed to be chocolate fudge flavored, but in my opinion, they don't taste anything like chocolate. They have a really funky, almost bitter flavor to them.I was also more than a little freaked out by the choking warning on this back of the bag. It tells you to drink a 8oz serving of water or other liquid after eating this. If you don't, the chew could swell and cause you to choke. I was nervous to try this to begin with.

"I ordered this book several months ago, but never read it. I came across it recently and decided to read it. Honestly, I wasn't quite sure what to expect after reading the back cover. But I'm very glad I decided to give this book a chance. This is one of those books that will appeal to a wide variety of readers. There are elements of action, suspense, drama, romance, and history. There is also a strong Christian element to this novel. I thought it started out a bit slow, but once I got into it, I couldn't stop reading it. In a lot of ways, this book is very similiar to the novels ""This Present Darkness"" and Piercing the Darkness"" by Frank Peretti. It also had echos of the Left Behind series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. But while this novel has similiarities to these other works, it is distinct and unique. The plot is exciting and full of twists and turns. Just when you think you have things all figured out, something completely unexpected happens. It left me guessing right up until the very end. The characters in this novel are complex and believable. There isn't a flat character to be found. I found it especially easy to sympathize and empathize with Jagger, one of the major characters. I could relate to a lot of his questions and struggles. But I was also able to sympathize with the Tribe members. Even though I found their logic twisted and their actions dispicable, I was still able to see them as lost, hurting, deceived souls in dire need of redemption. This book gave me a lot to think about. I know this is a novel I won't soon forget. I definitely plan on checking out other novels by this author.

"Lately, I've really been struggling with the idea of understanding where I fit in to the body of Christ. I've felt dissastified for a long time. I really want to serve, but I have no idea where to start or where I would be most effective. I have kind of a vague idea about what my spiritual gifts are, but not a clue on where to serve using those things. I've taken career tests, personality tests and read books, but still felt stuck. So when I first read about this book, I was excited.This book is written in a very readable, easy to understand fashion. Krista is not a pastor, a doctorate of theology, or a readily recognizable television personality or Christian author. But in my opinion, those are strengths not weaknesses. She writes from her own struggles and growth in this area. She has a lot of great insight and practical, useable ideas. I know that I will refer to my notes from this book often. This book will challenge you to think in new ways, to take a risk, and step out in faith. She also weaves in many stories from others who have successfully found and are living out their calling. I also really like that the author states that people who serve God in the marketplace (ie in a regular job) aren't second-class Christians. They can have just as much impact as people who are involved in things like church leadership or missions work. I think this element is missing in a lot of Christian books like this.However, in my opinion, this book does have one major flaw. First, I didn't think she spent enough time discussing the ins and outs of each spiritual gift. She does list them and talk about where they are found in Scripture, but she never really discusses them in detail. I also found it odd that she didn't include any kind of tests or assessments in this book. Now, I know these types of books can easily get bogged down with assessments. But this book needed at least a couple. At the very least, I thought she should have included a spiritual gifts assessment and possibly a passions and/or personality tests.Another complaint I had about this book is that she focuses a lot of attention on how to find your calling, but very little on actually living it out. I think she assumes the reader will be able to figure that out on their own. But when I got to the end of this book, I felt like there were a lot of loose ends. I wish she had pulled all the information together a little more. For example, I think that she should have taken all her great information about spiritual gifts and personality, passions, interests etc, and then listed where someone can use those gifts to serve in the church or in the marketplace. She does include some links to different types of assessments in the back of the book. I do usually thumb through the notes and references in a the back of books, but if you are someone who doesn't, it could be easy to miss, and you will probably end up really frustrated at the end of this book. But I think this information should have been more incorporated into the book, rather than just tacked on as almost an afterthought. The information that is here is excellent, helpful, and practical. For that reason I gave this book 4 stars. This book is definitely worth reading","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SW5SBJMWBUDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052U6FAC#wasThisHelpful","R2SW5SBJMWBUDP","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lately, I've been thinking about getting more involved with serving both in my church and just in general. I came across this book in the Kindle Store and decided to order it. There are some great ideas in here about practical, simple service projects. I also really liked the emphasis on being willing to do whatever, wherever. I think so often, people are only willing to do things that will attract attention to themselves. But even a cursory reading of the Gospels will make it crystal clear that is not Jesus' way.However, in my opinion, there is one major flaw about this book, and what ultimately made me decide to return it. On almost every page, Pastor Rizzo is talking about something he and his church did. Now, to be fair, this church has done a lot of great things. They were willing to serve the firefighters after 9/11 and to help out the victims of Hurricane Katrina. I don't doubt for a minute that Pastor Rizzo has anything but the best of intentions. I think he has a lot of great insight and experiences to share. I just think he went about it in the wrong way. Rather than focusing so much on his church, I think this book would have been much more effective if he had focused on the entire body of Christ. After all, this is stuff that all Christians should be doing, not just one particular church. I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't get past the constant references to one individual church. I agree with a previous reviewer who stated that it definitely has a tone of ""look what we did"" Which is really too bad, because I think this book discusses a vitally important topic, one that people need to be challenged in.I highly recommend ""Barefoot Church"" By Brandon Hatmaker and ""The Dangerous Act of Loving Your Neighbor"" by Mark Labberton.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MNKZCHIE22II/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NLL6XA#wasThisHelpful","R3MNKZCHIE22II","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But in all honesty, I found it to be very dull and slow-moving. I felt like the plot crawled a long at a snail's pace. I kept reading in the hopes that it would get better, but I finished over half the book, and it never did capture my interest. I also found the characters very hard to relate to.

"I received this book for my Kindle as a Christmas gift from my brother and sister and law. I really want to see the movie version of ""Life of Pi"" but wanted to read the book first. I thought the book dragged just a little the first couple of chapters. But there are numerous facts about animals and their way of life sprinkled throughout this book. I would classify myself as an animal lover, so I found that enjoyable. Also, this book is beautifully written. The story is engaging. One thing I wasn't prepared for in this novel was the amount of gore and violence. At times, it felt like it went overboard.Pi finds himself stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean when the freighter he is sailing on sinks. None of humans, except Pi survive. He finds himself in a lifeboat (and a rather small one at that) with a hyena, a zebra, a orangatan named Orange Juice, and a massive, 450 pound male adult Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The other animals don't make it very far into the journey. The zebra and orangatan are killed by the hyena and the tiger kills the hyena. All that remains is Pi and the most dangerous of his animal passengers, Richard Parker. Both are willing to do almost anything to survive. Pi knows that he must be ever viligant around Richard Parker. He knows all too well that showing any type of weakness or letting his guard down would mean death. There are many twists and turns in this book. The reader is kept guessing what is going to happen next. You can almost feel the wind in your face. You can sense Pi's growing desperation, hunger, and thirst. You feel his despair when it seems there is no hope of being rescued.The main reason why I didn't give this novel 5 stars is because of the religious aspect. Pi practices Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity. Not one after the other, all at the same time. He juggles the lifestyles and beliefs of all 3 religions at one time. He resists being told that he has to pick only one. There is definitely the underlying belief that all religions are valid and as long as you are sincere, it doesn't matter what you believe. It is a common theme in our politically correct society.  It does matter what you believe and sincerity is simply not enough. It is possible to be sincerely wrong. But even though I don't agree with the religious underpinnings of this story, it didn't keep me from loving this book. The rest of the story was so engaging and enjoyable, that I was able to overlook the religious ambiguity.I highly recommend this book. It is a quick, enjoyable read that is very well written.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KV47X7TOH8C3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0070Y46UY#wasThisHelpful","R2KV47X7TOH8C3","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used this body wash before. It actually works really well for shaving your legs. It gives you a nice, close, shave and reduces nicks and cuts. It also makes your skin feel really soft after using it. So I didn't hesitate at all about ordering this product. I think the Tangerine and Ginger scent is great. I do have one minor complaint. It clearly states in the Vine ad (I double checked just to make sure) that this product should have come as a 2-pack. However, I received only a single 24oz package.

"When I first read the description of this book, and the back cover, I wasn't at all sure what to expect. I have read one of Frank Viola's books ""Pagan Christianity"" (which I also highly recommend. But to be honest, I didn't find the either description for this book particularly compelling. In fact, I was hesitant to read it at first. I had this book for about 2 weeks before I started reading it. I was also somewhat confused and intimidated by the term Theography. I didn't even really understand what that meant. But I am so glad that I decided to give this book a chance. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It drew me in from the very first page.I read the Bible from cover to cover, for the first time at age 18. I'm not in my mid 30s. So I would say that I am very familiar with the teachings, people, and stories of the Bible. I have studied the Bible for myself, but I have also read countless biblically-based books. I think this old saying ""Familiarity breeds contempt"" is especially true when it comes to the Bible.  If a person has a long history with the Bible, it can be tempting to think that there is nothing more to learn from or about the Bible. But I can't tell you the number of times that God has made His Word come alive to me in a completely new way.  I can read a verse I've read hundreds of times before, and gain a new insight or notice something I never noticed before. This is has happened more times than I can count over the course of my Christian life. The Bible is unlike any other book in existence. It is a living, breathing organism.  It is so much more than simply words on a page. But sometimes, it can be difficult to remember that.I admit, there are times when I have struggled to reconcile the God portrayed in the Old Testament with the life and teachings of Jesus in the New Testament.  At first glance, they can seem like polar opposites.This book does an excellent job of tying together the Old Testament and the New Testament into a seamless whole. It helps the reader see Scripture itself and the person of Jesus Christ in a way that is refreshing and new.In the Old Testament, there are 109 Messianic prophesies. All of which, down to the last detail, were fulfilled in the birth, life, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  But the Old Testament also contains parallels and glimpses of Jesus Christ that have nothing to do with prophesy.  They are mere shadows in the Old Testament. They are much more detailed and clear in the New Testament.  There are numerous examples that I could cite, but in my opinion, one of the clearest are the Old Testament book of Leviticus and the New Testament book of Hebrews. At first glance, these books couldn't seem more different. Leviticus gives very specific and detailed instructions about how to worship God and how to live a holy life. There is extensive discussion about being ceremonially clean and unclean, and many different types of sin offerings and sacrifices.  Leviticus is part of the law. This also includes the law of Moses (more commonly known as the Ten Commandments).  But when placed alongside the book of Leviticus, it becomes obvious that Hebrews is a compare and contrast of the Old Covenant (Leviticus and the rest of the law) and the New Covenant (set forth by Jesus Christ).  Under the Old Covenant, the standard was absolute perfection.  Sinful  humanity, apart from Jesus Christ, has zero chance of meeting that standard.  However, Jesus, lived a completely perfect life. He never sinned, even in the smallest regard.  Therefore, He fulfilled the law. He paid the penalty that humanity owed, but could never pay.He also broke the curse of the law. Because of what Jesus did on the Cross, we are no longer subject to the law.The book of Galatians has much to teach us about the relationship between the law and faith in Jesus Christ.  Galatians 2:21 (New Living Translation) says  If keeping the law makes us right with God, then there was no need for Jesus to die.  Galatians 3 tells us why the law was given.  Galatians 3:19 says What then, was the purpose of the law? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sin.Another New Testament that has a lot to say about this issue is the book of Romans.  Romans 7:4-6, 8 tells us You died to the power of the law when you died with Christ.  So I discovered that the law's commands, which were supposed to bring life, brought spiritual death instead.Romans 10:4 is even more clear.  For Christ already accomplished the purpose for which the law was given.Finally, the book of James makes it crystal clear that trying to please God by keeping the law is an exercise in futility. James 2:10 (NIV) says Whoever keeps the whole law, yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking it all.This book offers the reader a new lens through which to view Scripture. It helps you understand how the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation is about salvation through Jesus Christ.If you feel that your study of Scripture has become stagnant, do yourself a favor and read this book. I promise you won't be sorry you did.If reading this book has left you hungry for more, I highly recommend ""Jesus Through Middle Eastern Eyes"" By Ken Bailey and ""The Message of the Old Testament: Promises Made"" and  ""The Message of the Old Testament: Promises Kept"" both by Mark Dever.  These last two books develop even further the ideas and themes found in ""Jesus: A Theography.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W76G9G9M48WQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0849947022#wasThisHelpful","R1W76G9G9M48WQ","A3NL394M1LEAFX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NL394M1LEAFX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love to have parties but when you use nice glass and people dont know which glass is there and you she a bunch of women sitting around drinking wine you can end up with confused women.  So you start your party and place each of the glasses on a table with these markers and they get to decorate their glass before they start drinking and if you are nice and want to send home a parting gift you can give them the glass to go..

"If you want a flat uncomfortable pillow please do not purchase this pillow.  It is by far one of the fluffy yet not mushy pillows I have ever had.  It is crazy that it comes in a tube and you unroll and watch it expand.  It is almost as fun to watch it grow as it is nice to sleep on.  I gave this one to my husband who complains about everything new I give him and low and behold this time he actually had nice things to say, he had his best nights sleep in weeks and has not complained about a bad nights sleep since getting it.  Now it did take a few minutes in the dryer to get it to its best potential, but that was all that it took.. A couple of minutes on low and bam it was soooooo fluffy and full.

"These are absolutely the cutest couple necklace for your faith based family member.  They are much lighter than I thought they would be seeing as they are stainless steel but still very nice.  Originally I got them for my daughter and her husband but he received a necklace from his dying father and I didn't want to put him in the position of having to chose so I decided to give the her pendant to my daughter and kept the his for myself.  It worked out great.  As you will see from the photo that it is not so big that a lady couldn't wear it as well.  They are very sturdy chains so you are not feeling like they are gonna break on you or anything even with little hands pulling on them.

I like that you get an oil for about anytime you would want to diffuse for, I use the dreamy sleep when my pups are acting up and need to be settled down it works like a charm and it a little better smelling then just lavender.  When I really need to concentrate on something I diffuse the mellow mind and it helps me have a clear thought process.  I am very happy with the set over all.  The breathe one helps when I am having allergy issues and helps to clear my passages.  Nice complete starter kit for those looking for blends to diffuse.

I took it out of the box and put it in a large square tupperware that fits on my lap and while watcing TV or when I feel the frustation coming on I get it out and fiddle with it.I love that it feels like sand but yet doesnt spill all over a few swipes of your hand and you have it all back where it belongs.

I filled it up and was trying to put it away when of course my lovely doggies decided that they wanted to come and jump on me and knock it out of my hand.. it bounced to the floor-- bottles still in tack..It is very well stitched and the zipper isnt a cheap one that you can expect to break in a few uses.. it has a secure handle that seems to not even strain under a full case.. Nice over all case for your oils.. You can store them, take them and protect them in one case.. I was very lucky to receive this at a discount to test and leave my honest and unbiased review.

"I have always loved star gazing and never knew how much more fun it is when you can see them closer!  I don't want to pretend to know what I am looking at, I don't but I can tell you what I see is amazing.  I feel like it is so much more satisfying to see the stars closer than just a light in the sky.  When my kids where young my in laws gave my son a telescope and we were never able to see anything so based on that this on is the right stuff.  It's practical price for the beginner but high enough wuality that you won't feel let down.Its height adjusted nicely for bit myself and my husband so neither of us felt strained using it and it adjusted rather easy.  The choice magnification is perfect for the beginner as we are.

"Let's start that I am a purse snob.  I will not carry just any purse... In the past all I bought was brand name purses.  Now I am still a purse snob and to be honest feel like I am on the ground floor of a new amazing brand.  This purse was so much more then I expected.  First the color, I love the distressed look, the coloring is soooooo amazing, why do I love that so much well.. have you ever had a leather purse and got a little rained on and had those spots?  The coloring on this will mask that because it is not a solid brown it is kind of a distressed look, that is the only way I can explain it.  Second the over all look... It is soooo cute, the fringe, the style the over all look is just first class.  The quality of the leather is top notch... what I didnt notice when ordering is you get not one but two handles... You can wear it over the shoulder or over the arm...I am so happy with this purse... It is over all the perfect size, not to big so you add to much stuff and start getting back aches, not so small you can't carry what you need.  I love that you have also two options to close it it has the draw string that I love but the magnetic clasp to get extra security.. Nice over all purse.I was lucky to get this purse at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review but I can tell you as a purse snob it is well worth the money because of the over all look and quality it will last a long time..Hint Hint... If you made this same purse without the fringe would be awesome too....","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA2MXN9CSNJ9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0113O67EE#wasThisHelpful","RA2MXN9CSNJ9O","A4GEGMPY0ETIP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GEGMPY0ETIP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have nerve injury that gives me horrible headaches so bright lights are rough and so I was looking for a way to relax and detox from the day,  I found that I put some great quality lavender in this diffuser, start it flowing in a closed bathroom while my bath runs and when it's time to actually get in my bathroom becomes a spa like feel.

It is a calculator you can strap to your wrist as well as a stop watch, calendar, and a clock with dual time functions.  What more could a nerd ask for?  I've been wearing this exact brand/style watch for over 2 decades now.  It's been with me when I was in the Army and through out the desert.  Its been with me though hiking and adventuring.  It's been through a lot.  If you have fat fingers (you know who you are) you can use a pen to press the buttons but Id just opt for a real calculator at that point.  Most times I dont need the calculator but its there if you need it.  Now if only they made one with a back light like this.  Battery life is 2+ years for me.

"I live in Colorado and if you dont use Nitrogen in your tires you wind up losing pressure most days.  It cost 1$ to use the air pumps infront of the gas stations most places here.  This compressor has paid for itself within the first year.  On cold mornings just plug it in inside and let it fill.  Then take it outside and air up the tires to max psi.  Then if you want (if it starts snowing) you have the option to deflate your tires yourself for more traction.  Fast filling, simple design, light weight, and easy to use.

All I did was re-sand it down at wax it so it wouldnt happen again.  Since they are hit and miss, I have them strapped to my survival bag now.  They will be great for survival situations but for practical use they are more miss.  I have however deboned a few chickens with these and I used them to cut my food a few times outdoors.

"No extra parts or assembly required.  Just simply unscrew the existing shower head and screw in this new one.  It has the built in shower head holder for the hand held sprayer built right in too.  Perfect for if you want to share a shower with a special someone.  Just get some screw in hooks and hang one on the opposite end of the shower and you can have water from both ends.  Both shower heads have 3 sprayer settings (shower, pulse(center) and full blast )and there is a switch on top to have main head, extended head, or both on.  If you get lower pressure than you're used to (since it is 2 shower heads) you can turn the knob half click and it will cut the pressure from the extender without shutting it off giving the main a ton of pressure :)  Hope this helps","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N90WM9HJP1TD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Z0CGGI#wasThisHelpful","R3N90WM9HJP1TD","A2NGLQZKRHT4J3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NGLQZKRHT4J3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cheap alternative to LUSH USA.  I mean if you can even really compare anything to lush...  Smells aren't as fragrant.  The frosting on the top doesn't dissolve and isn't soap or anything.  My wife has a drawer with 100$'s of Lush bath oils, bombs, bubblebars, etc. and I wanted to see how these compared...  She used 2 cupcakes and gave the rest away.  Only reason she used a second was to make sure it wasn't just a faulty bath bomb.  If you're gonna shell out the cash, get lush and not these cheap knock offs.I guess she's spoiled.  And as a guy I don't really do baths.  If you never had lush these may be good for you but I can tell you this...  When she gets out of a lush bath, I want to lick her from head to toe she smells so good.  After these cupcake baths it was a kinda chemically/artifically taste I can't explain.

"30w and 110dB later the cops were called for a noise complaint.  These little speakers really push.  If you put the bass dial 3/4 and turn up the speakers 1/2 way you will wake up everyone in the household.  If you crank the bass dial 90%, speaker volume 90%, and set the input device (phone, mp3 player, etc) volume to 90% (so you dont get hiss, crackles, and distortions) you can entertain the whole street if you open the garage door.  Someone say Block Party?  No Peavey's needed.Read my previous reviews.  I run my tech through a ringer.  If you want a cheap speaker set that will provide you awesome sound quality and still shake the pictures on your wall, this is it.On the dB meter these speakers pushed about 110.  So it's not a stretch to say every set should push over 100dB easy.  Just enough to make you  start going deaf if you listen top end in a closed room.

That decision has not changed.This one, Hand Me Down Princess, begins a new series and it was wonderful! Prince Malachi must marry a woman he has never spoken to, not ever seen, all because of a promise his father, the king, made to this woman's father many years ago.During this book, revelations about their families threaten to destroy their lives, intrigue abounds and love begins to grow little by little. All the while, the spiritual thread runs through that we are God's children, no matter what others think of us.There was an excerpt from the next book in the series and oh boy, I can't wait.*I was given a copy of this book by the author in exchange for an honest review.

"This second book in the Valiant Hearts series is so good. I love, love, love a good medieval story and Dina Sleiman provides that wondefully.Allen of Ellsworth, formerly a part of the Farthingale Ghosts, has now departed for Edendale, believing that God has directed him there. What he finds is most unexpected and takes him totally by surprise.Lady Gwendolyn Barnes wants to be a knight like her brothers, but sadly, she is only a marriage pawn in this age. Her father is a tyrant, determined to wed her to a vicious man.Gwendolyn and Allen must trust fully in God's plan for their lives. (Jeremiah 29:11) For He does indeed have a plan.There's plenty of action, intrigue, sadness and joy in this book. One of my favorite quotes from the book is this: ""Circumstances might look grim for a time, but God can turn matters for the good. He alone can sustain your soul through whatever adversity you might face."" And as a Christian, I can say that this sentence is very true. God has, can and will continue to sustain us as we continue to place our trust in Him. (2 Corinthians 1:8-10)* I was provided with a copy of this book by the publisher.

"From Joanne Bischof's first book, I have been a huge fan. She is a wonderful writer, gifted with the ability to tell a tale that holds the reader enthralled from the first paragraph.Joanne ventures from historical to contemporary in this story, Riley and Becca's story. Both are teenagers, and before you think, 'I don't want to read a book about teenagers', please think again. This is one of the most tender, loving and precious stories you'll ever read.Riley is trying to get to Becca, whose family has had a crisis and has had to move very far away for a while. On his way to get to Becca, Riley encounters some difficulties. How Riley manages to get to Becca is an integral part of the story and one that changes Riley's life.Bischof manages with every book to engage the reader's emotions to a degree that they are so sad when her stories end. I want these people to be real! She has a wonderful ability and I'm so glad she began to write. I can't wait for what she has for me to read next.Sometimes, a broken down transmission is not such a bad thing, either.

"Laura Frantz became my all time favorite author with her very first book,The Frontiersman's Daughter.  She is the absolute queen of historical Christian fiction.  No doubt about that at all.  Her research is always spot on, each book prompting me to go back and check into the period and learn even more.  I love history and she does it proud.With each book, Laura Frantz manages somehow to draw her readers completely into the story and they just don't want to leave!  This reader didn't.  I only wish that life wouldn't intrude when I'm reading one of her books, but my dog and husband needed feeding! :)*I was provided with a copy of this book by the publisher and not encouraged to leave a positive review; all opinions are my own and honest.I felt at home as soon as I read her first sentence.  It's like sitting on the porch with an old friend, comfortable, at ease and not wanting the day to end.  Her words on paper are joyful to read, heart grabbing in their sincerity, uplifting in their spirituality.  The spiritual lesson here for me is: no matter how bleak things look, keep your faith in God for He will work things out for your good and His glory.The Revolutionary War has just ended and General Seamus Ogilvy has returned after 8 years away. His wife has been dead for years and his young daughter staying with her aunt. Seamus brings Lily Cate home and intends to raise her himself, burdened though he is.  Sophie Menzies lives at Three Chimneys, not far from Tall Acre, Seamus's home.  Lily Cate wanders over one day and captures Sophie's heart.  Sophie had assisted her midwife mother at Lily Cate's birth 5 years ago and has never forgotten Seamus.  He captured her heart and has held it for years.Sophie is about to lose her home because of unpaid taxes and also because her father was a Tory.  Seamus desperately needs a mother for Lily Cate, so he asks Sophie to marry him.  She agrees to marry Seamus and become to mistress of Tall Acre.  Great plan, right?  Well, things go awry, and Sophie and Seamus must learn to cope when times are hard.  Can their faith keep them?  Will they allow God to handle it? Even though it may not go the way they want?Laura Frantz is a total master at crafting historicals.  Completely masterful. With each book she writes I find myself looking up different things in history just to learn more.  She makes me want to know more about each period she writes about.  Her words flow onto the paper like rich chocolate and melting butter, so full of flavor that the reader is completely full of each word she writes.  The characters come to life as soon as they are introduced and each scene leaves you captivated, waiting breathlessly for the next one. She even describes locations and rooms in the houses in such a way that the reader feels as if they are walking the same lanes, wandering in the same woods and feels right at home in the houses.  Her prose is amazingly outstanding.  I just don't know how she does it!  I feel as if I'm sitting with her on my front porch, talking and drinking tea, as she tells me about her book.  I feel as if I'm privy to a part of her author's heart as I read her book.  I can tell she has just poured herself into her books.Laura Frantz's books always, always have pride of place on my shelves and will never be displaced.  I'm sad the book is over and now I must move on.  I want to stay there inside the book with Seamus, Sophie and Lily Cate and the other characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L4N73BXY2KB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080072044X#wasThisHelpful","R1L4N73BXY2KB8","A22F5YTVKQUZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F5YTVKQUZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh, I do wish I could give this book 10 stars! I was so happy to at last begin the long awaited last book in The Song of Sears trilogy. I didn't think I would like Christian fantasy, but had thoroughly enjoyed Carla Laureano's contemporary novel, so I thought I'd give the fantasy a try. Wow, what I would have missed had I not read these books.When the second book came out, I reread the first in preparation for Beneath the Forsaken City, book two to Oath of The Brotherhood. It was amazing! I eagerly watched for The Sword and The Song. I loved these characters and longed to know what they would experience in this last installment.The island of Seare is at war. The Red Druid is gathering strength and power to stand against Conor, Eoghan, and the Firein Brotherhood. But there is a bit of strife between Conor and Eoghan, causing distance between them. Conor leaves to find the key to defeating the Red Druid, leaving Aine to worry about him falling prey to the druid and other dangers. How will they make it? There is danger everywhere and from every source, even within their own fortress. Nothing and no one is at it seems. Who can they trust?Carla Laureano has crafted a magnificent ending to this trilogy. Each character is more in depth, more moving and more real to the reader. They were before, but this go round, they are people you never want to let go, never want to finish the book and say goodbye, but hungry to finish to find out the ending.I won't give anything away, so there will be no spoilers here. I can't even begin to imagine how Carla has so much of this in her mind, to be able to write such a spectacular tale! I literally wept through the last half of one chapter, tears streaming down my face so fast and hard, I had to wipe them away to see the words on the page. When I finished the chapter, I just sobbed aloud. Literally. This book was absolutely outstanding! This series is one that will have pride of place on my bookshelves, destined to be read again and again. They deserve to be made into a miniseries, too. This would make great theatrical work.I really can't say enough good things about this book and the two before it. I am not gifted enough to describe how wonderful this series was.

"I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this series.  Loved it!~  I bought the next 2 as soon as I finished the first. This one was not quite as good.  For two reasons:  The heroine, Elizabeth, got on my nerves so bad! She was whiney, petulant and just plain obnoxious through more than half the book.  Tom put up with it and never once lost his temper with her.  I don't know about the middle ages, but what man would be so longsuffering with a woman acting that way?  He was all goodness to her, but still she was selfish and complaining.  I find it hard to believe a man could be so kind, but Tom did indeed love God and tried to live his best as a servant of Christ.I continued reading because it was a good book and held my interest and I'm glad I did, for it  picked up and things changed.  I absolutely LOVED the spiritual message and themes in this book.  Truly appreciated them.  And the ending?  Wow.  One scene near the end had me in tears.I'm off to read the third. Hope it's good.

"This is one of the most powerful books I have ever read! It truly deserves double the 5 stars allowed here.Set in Nazi Germany 1938-1944 and in America and Germany in 1972-1973, it an astounding story of God's grace and power to help His children forgive anything.Hannah Sterling, in 1972, has recently lost her mother and is about to lose her job unless she can control her bitterness. Given a leave by her principal, Hannah begins to pour over her mother's possessions, trying to find some answer to why her mother was always so cold and harsh with her and everyone else, why her mother and father fought all the time. What she finds leads her to Germany, to a grandfather she never knew she had. Hannah learns there are many, many secrets her mother kept from her, secrets that devastate her. This grandfather she found and hopes to forge a bond with is not the man she wants or needs him to be.Lisielotte Sommer, Hannah's mother, also tells her tale, set in the years 1938-1944 in the midst of the horror of the Holocaust. The reader learns much from this woman who endures more than we would have imagined.I won't give anything else away for fear of spoilers. Cathy Gohlke writes wonderful books, but this is her absolute personal best! I was entranced, absolutely captivated and had to tear myself away to do needful things like cook for my family! It was as if I couldn't rest until I finished this book.My book is marked and underlined in many,many places. This is not a book you put down after you finish and forget about it. NO! It is a book that lingers on in your heart because it is so rich and powerful. Powerful in that it teaches the reader a huge spiritual principle: the power of forgiveness.

"This is the 3rd book in Regina Scott's 'Frontier Bachelor' series and so far, in my opinion, the absolute best!James Wallin's family is depending on him to find a school teacher for their frontier town. Alexandrina Fosgrave seems to be exactly what they need. But, and it'a big one, will she accept?James Wallin is such a character, full of wit and always ready with a quick response to anything. He thoroughly charmed me and had me rooting for him. James carries a secret, though. Will he allow God to heal that dark hurt he carries?Alexandrina also carries a hurt inside. She has decided it's better to never love than to be hurt again, so she erects a barrier around her heart.The spiritual lesson here is that God loves us no matter how we may feel about ourselves or what has happened in our lives. And, we must forgive ourselves as well.*I was given a copy of this book by the author in exchange for an honest review.

"I truly and thoroughly enjoyed Shelley Gray's western series and wished she would write more in that genre.  She writes mostly Amish fiction and I am not a fan, so when I saw this, I was absolutely delighted!  She goes back to the western series and tells Russell's story, who was a member of the Walton Gang.Russell comes home to find his mother dying and the girl he loved seeing a preacher now.  Well, things are not always what they seem.  I can't say more. I loved Russell's character. Gray's descriptions and sometimes comedic turn is absolutely fabulous!

"Tamera Alexander has been a favorite for many years. Her writing is full, descriptive and great!  We first met Savannah Darby in To Win Her Favor and I felt she deserved her own story even then. So I was particularly glad when Tamera told me she was indeed going to have a story!Savannah is called back to work at her family's repossessed home after the Civil War has ended. She desperately wishes she could live there again.  The new owner's fiance is changing everything, much to Savannah's dismay. She is there to look for what she was instructed to find in her father's last letter to her now dead mother.  She is the also the sole supporter of her much younger brother and sister.This is a wonderful story. As a rule, I don't like novellas, much preferring an entire full length novel, but this one was good.  Not many authors can pull off a novella and make it seem as full as Tamera Alexander. There are a few who do, but not many. This one is worth the time to read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XE22N50CACNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWOGZVM#wasThisHelpful","R2XE22N50CACNG","A22F5YTVKQUZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F5YTVKQUZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, I can say for sure that Susan May Warren books never,ever disappoint.The Wonder of You is the 5th book in the Christiansen Family novels and Amelia's story. Amelia is the youngest and everyone has always spoiled and protected her. Anyone who has read this series will remember at the close of the last book, Always On My Mind, Amelia returned home early from her European adventure, withdrawn. Then Roark St. John showed up and apologized to her, only to be driven away by her brothers and father.Well, Roark comes back to Deep Haven, convinced that Amelia is the one for him. If only Amelia would cooperate. Seth Turnquist also has loved Amelia forever and wants her to be his bride.Roark is heir to a vast fortune in the Constantine Hotels dynasty, but he is dealing with and haunted by tragedy, not sure what his life holds or what he is supposed to do. Roark has been from one country to another, never knowing how to stop running, But Amelia has given him a reason to stay put.Amelia is doing a bit of her own running, too. From God. Unsure of what decision she should make, but feeling something way down deep in her heart that won't quite let go, Amelia is confused and hurt by what she feels are lies Roark has told her.This was an amazing 5th book in this series. I love Deep Haven. I want to go visit. I want to stay a while in this tiny hamlet in the north woods of Minnesota. Susan May Warren has created characters and locales that not only enter the imagination of the reader, but take root and become very nearly a reality. I desperately sometimes want to be there and visit with all these people. Seriously. I really do. That's how good this writer is. When I have to put the book down to return to my regular life, I think about it and can't wait to pick it back up again.I also love how Susan lets us visit with and catch up with the characters from previous books. The secondary story line she gives to Max and Grace just blew me away and had me in tears, sobbing, even, at times. In fact, I wept more than a few times during this book. And the ending was sublime. Pure wonderful.Next up is the last book, Owen's story. Owen, the prodigal. I cannot wait to see how Susan reaches him for Christ.This book has a powerful spiritual message running throughout, as do all her books. I appreciate so much her ability to include this in her books and her bravery in taking a deep stand for Christ in her books. Some Christian authors do not. God loves us even when we don't love or believe in ourselves. He's waiting, arms stretched out, ready when we decide that His plan is best.

"MaryLu Tyndall can rock a pirate tale! It's great to be out on the high seas again with all her wonderful characters. AND she has brought some back from previous books so that we can have a nice visit with them, too.This is a time travel pirate tale and it is a great one, too! Morgan has just been diagnosed with liver cancer and is at a pirate festival when she becomes lost from her friends and suddenly finds herself on a REAL pirate's ship in 1694! Oh goodness! But Morgan doesn't get it; she seems to think this is all a big act funded by her absentee father to make her feel better. When she finally realizes that this is indeed 1694, she is totally bereft.Rowan is a pirate, trying to find that elusive treasure that will allow him to feel he finally measures up. Neither he nor Morgan have any use for God. However, as we all know, God has use for them!This was a rollicking good book and I have always loved how MaryLu Tyndall includes spiritual warfare in her books.

"I hate to be the odd man out here, but I just couldn't seem to connect with this book.  First of all, there were a few swear words here and I don't want to see that in a Christian fiction book.  I know they are what people might call 'minor' swear words, but they were unnecessary.  I believe that you can say anything anywhere without resorting to profanity.  That's my opinion and I'm fully aware that others will disagree, but I'm entitled to it.  We are cautioned in Scripture to not use coarse language. That's why I read Christian fiction.I just couldn't seem to grasp the characters. They did not seem very real to me. The story line just wasn't there for me.  Maybe because I've just finished several awesome books, but it just didn't 'grab' me.  I won't let this stop me from reading another book by this author, however.

"Jen Turano is a master at writing Christian comedy. Seriously, she is. She has now written 6 books and I've read and own every single one and they have pride of place on my book shelves. This one, I'm happy to say, was no different. Spectacular! She is in very fine form indeed in her latest, 'In Good Company'. I was laughing by the second page and it never let up, only got better.Miss Millie Longfellow and Mr. Everett Mulberry, who we met in the previous book as secondary characters are the stars in this book. Millie is a nanny who always seems to be fired from every job she gets, no matter that she feels she is a wonderful nanny. Everett has just been willed 3 incorrigible children when his friends die in a carriage accident. Those children manage to run off every nanny he hires, too. However, he wants no part of Millie as his nanny.The employment agency which places nannies, at their absolute wit's end, decides that the best solution to both Everett and Millie's problems are that they should work together, Everett hiring Millie as his wards' nanny. Oh goodness.From there, the action just continues to escalate and hijinks abound. Millie is a most unconventional nanny and manages to get herself into odd situations.Before long, both Millie and Everett find themselves a bit drawn to each other, which is unfortunate, since Everett has been keeping company for quite some time with a very popular memeber of society. One who is beginning to get on his nerves.Jen Turano has been a favorite author of mine since I read her first novella, which was a prequel to her first 4 book series. I often find myself bursting out laughing frequently as I read her books. My husband just looks at me and looks away, he is so used to it.Jen has the ability to craft characters that are just so wonderful, the reader falls right in love with them and wants to sit down and have a meal with them! I absolutely love her characters and all the scrapes they get into. If you want a rollicking good time and a wonderful spiritual theme, you absolutely MUST read Jen Turano's books.

"Carla Laureano brings us book two in The MacDonald Family trilogy with London Tides. London Tides is Ian MacDonald's story.Grace Brennan, photojournalist travels the world's war zones documenting the helpless and forgotten. After the death of her friend and colleage, Grace is shaken and returns to London.Grace and Ian MacDonald had been engaged ten years earlier, but she left without a word, only leaving her engagement ring at his home. Ian gave up his championship rowing career and dreams of Olympic gold years ago for Grace....only to have her choose her career over him.Grace has never stopped loving Ian, but she's been too far and seen too much and carries way too much hurt. Has Ian forgiven her? Could it be that he can forgive her and they can go forward? Will the problems that they've faced tear them apart for good or can they make a go of this relationship?This was by far one of the most full and richest novels I've ever read. Carla Laureano has a way of creating characters so well that they actually feel real to the reader! Seriously. She pulls you in with her vivid descriptions and emotions that you very nearly feel the pain and heartbreak, the joy and tears of these people! Even secondary characters!She's not afraid to delve way down, plumbing the very depths of human emotion. Nor is she afraid to tackle heartbreak and fear in her characters. Rarely do I read a book that makes me 'feel' the pain and joy of characters as I did here. I was very impressed with her giftedness with the written word. The book was deep, rich, full and intensely moving. I wept with Ian and Grace, cheered them on and wished them the very best life has to offer two people.Carla's descriptions of everything, even the food (especially the food!), are so totally vivid, that the reader feels like they're sitting in this restaurant, walking that street, relaxing at the kitchen table with the characters. I didn't want to miss one single word, going back and rereading several passages many times. This is excellent writing, folks. You don't want to miss this book.I'm afraid I lack the ability to convey how very much I loved this book and how well written it is. It is an admirable and excellent sequel to Five Days in Skye, which I read twice! I seriously look forward to Serena MacDonald's story, which will be next in the series.The spiritual theme running throughout impressed me as well. God does indeed see our heartbreak, feels the tragedies we go through and carries our suffering. He gives us hope. He gave Ian and Grace wonderful hope.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TVOL1SDG4VB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434708225#wasThisHelpful","R2TVOL1SDG4VB8","A22F5YTVKQUZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F5YTVKQUZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tiffany makes a huge mistake one night that leads to disastrous consequences, then she makes an ever greater mistake dealing with it. Now she's dealing with the pain and heartache of that decision.Adam, a policeman, knows what happened to Tiffany, but it goes against everything he stands for. He wants to help, but doesn't really know how.In the meantime, drugs are still being peddled out of both Howard and Calvert Hall. And serious 'accidents' are taking place, with the potential to seriously injure others. Adam's trying, with the help of others, to ferret out the drug pushers, but can't keep his thoughts off Tiffany and the situation she's in.This was a wonderful novel. Connie Almony has written a great second book in her Maryland State University series. All these characters grow on the reader. I found myself looking for one from the last book. I know now there will be more in the series, and I seriously look forward to those!The spiritual lesson I took away was this: no matter what we've done, how far we've gone, God is ready to welcome us home with open arms. He can make even the vilest sinner clean. Not only that, but He makes a person FEEL clean and like they have a purpose to go on living.

"Carol Moncado just plan knows how to write a great story! This is in her The Montevaro Monarchy series, book 2. This one features Prince Richard, younger brother of soon to be crowned Queen Adeline.Richard loves hiking and signs on to do an outdoor trek with Ellie Brewer as guide. Well, things kinda happen from there, so no spoilers.Will Prince Richard be allowed by the monarchy to pursue the woman he loves or must he remain bound by royal tradition? Richard has a deep trust in God for his life and I found that to be very refreshing.Seriously Carol just writes very well. She creates characters that feel real, their emotions feel real, everything about them pulls the reader in.

"Retired physician Dr.Richard Mabry has found a wonderful career writing Christian suspense novels. I've read and enjoyed every single one. This one was no different.""A gunman who has nothing to lose faces a doctor who could lose it all. When Dr. Mark Baker and Nurse Kelly Atkinson are held hostage by a dangerous gunman, the life of every ER patient is at stake. At the end of the evening, 3 men are dead, including two members of the feared Zeta drug cartel. Though the standoff is over, the killing is not, because when the drug cartel loses its members, revenge is not far behind.When he finds himself under suspicion as a killer yet still a potential victim, Mark turns to an old friend for answers he needs in order to face an adversary whose desires are dark and whose efforts are ruthless. Who is the shooter? Who will the next victim be? And can Mark prove his innocence before the gun turns on him?""Dr. Mabry starts out with a bang in this novel, keeps the conflict going and continues to add layers, making this a suspense novel to make your heart pound with excitement. I love how he continues to add to the mystery, so that every time I think I might know who the culprit is, something happens to change my mind. And he completely surprised me! I had absolutely NO IDEA who the bad guy was. I suspected all the wrong people.Yet another good book from Dr. Richard Mabry. I never miss his novels.*I was provided with a free copy of this book by Abingdon Press in exchange for my honest review, which I have given.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PAERZSHUE458/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630881163#wasThisHelpful","R1PAERZSHUE458","A22F5YTVKQUZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F5YTVKQUZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading Centralia is like being whisked away by a monster roller coaster and not being able to get off! The ride is amazing, fast and never lets up, all the way to the end of the book!""Peter Ryan wakes up on a typical morning only to find his house empty, his wife and daughter nowhere to be found. His world is shattered after a phone call to a friends confirms the impossible: his wife and daughter died in a car accident he doesn't remember.Haunted by faint memories and flashes of details, Peter becomes convinced that something isn't right and begins to question reality. When he discovers a note in his daughter's handwriting, strange memories begin to surface that cause him to second guess nearly everything he once believed. Suddenly armed men show up at Peter's home, turning the mysterious puzzle of his past into a dangerous game of cat and mouse.On the run and unsure whom to trust, Peter has to discover what's real and what isn't.....before he loses everything.""That synopsis alone should be enough to convince you that you must read this book. But in case it doesn't, here's what I have to say: This book is absolutely amazing. Mike Dellosso hits the ground running with this one and the action does not let up one bit throughout the book! Never once. The action and adventure and yes, danger, swirl around the reader pulling you into a vortex of excitement that threatens to consume you until the book is finished.Peter is constantly surprised at everything happening around him because nothing, absolutely NOTHING, is what it seems. How in the world is Peter supposed to find out what is happening when there's no rhyme or reason to anything at all!Centralia is Mike Dellosso's 8th book and I've read every single one and they are terrific. If you enjoy Christian suspense, you MUST get this book. Don't waste anytime grabbing it.

"Mary Connealy at her best! Christian Cowboy Comedies is what she does and she does it very well. This one had a very suspenseful mystery included that keeps the reader guessing.Shannon is the middle Wilde sister, the ones who fought in the Civil War dressed as men. Tucker is a wild mountain man, tracking and hunting for a living. They meet up on the way over a cliff after going over is the only option. That or being eaten by a grizzly bear.No more clues to the rest of the story here. This is a terrific story, filled with Mary Connealy's usual dry sense of humor. I love the woman's work!Interspersed with all the action and humor, we see a wonderful spiritual message that God is in control and cares about everything that concerns us. And He can heal all our wounds, even the ones we let no one see.I can't wait for book three in this series and find out what Bailey Wilde gets herself into!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMYV2PYR3OFRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076421179X#wasThisHelpful","RMYV2PYR3OFRJ","A22F5YTVKQUZPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F5YTVKQUZPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When these were first advertised on TV, I was skeptical.  Turns out I was right. I saw them at a store for $5.00 and figured I might as well give them a try becaues the price was good.  Now I've used pee pads for my dogs for probably 8 years.  I trained our mini dachshund to one 5 years ago.  He always goes on the pad.This is a worthless product. I've never given anything a 1 star rating. This one doesn't deserve even that.  The dog goes everywhere on the pad EXCEPT the bulls eye that guarantees dogs will pee on the bulls eye!!  Totally worthless. I'm only thankful I didn't buy this when it was first out on the market.If you're looking for a remarkable and awesome pee pad, I can highly recommend the Retriever brand sold by Tractor Supply.

"I bought these to jazz up my exterior steps leading up to the front door.  Great colour, and I particularly like the leaf pattern, which coordinates nicely with the ivy-like vines growing all over my house.  There are two negatives with them - they don't stay in place all that well, often getting kicked over by shoes... and dirt and debris does stick to them (as I expected).  You have to regularly shake them out or vacuum.  But despite those two drawbacks, I am glad I bought them.  There was a slight polyurethane smell, but that dissipated quickly.  Overall, a nice product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1INF8THMFOXS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R99Q2GG#wasThisHelpful","R1INF8THMFOXS8","A6ZPK5DTNPZPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPK5DTNPZPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a lover of all things silver and crystal, and since I'm moving to a more contemporary and modern style, I thought I'd try this light.  It's beautiful!  A nice size, about 10"", not too small or too large.  I'm buying a second and may use them next to the bed on nightstands.  It would make a great single accent light anywhere too.  Note that this is an accent light, not a task light, though for me I can still see things reasonably well around it.  One star off because the pieces aren't crystal or glass but plastic, but I have a lot of experience with the other and they are a real chore to clean.  This material seems like it will take only a minor dusting every so often.Update:  I've purchased two now because I loved it so much, and I've tried it all over the house.  I like it best when not wide out in the open, but when in a smaller, tighter space, like on a bookshelf in between books/other accessories.  It creates a beautiful pattern against the back wall, which you wouldn't see if it was on top of a shelf.  It is also very nice in a collage of three items, one taller above it.  I'm still enthusiastically recommend this light!  And $45 is an amazing price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL11O7TYR11XA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CM5RVNA#wasThisHelpful","RL11O7TYR11XA","A6ZPK5DTNPZPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPK5DTNPZPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What's with all these high reviews on this product - are they bogus?  I just got this in the mail, tried it once, and immediately threw it out.  The product was not old or defective in that way, it's just a very poor cream eyeliner.  It does not have the right consistency to get on the brush or your face.  In the pot it looks like a rich dark colour, but in use it seems like it doesn't have a lot of pigment.  Not that sparkly or shimmery.  The brush is a weird shape, elongated not angled, so doesn't work at all.  I used my own.  I expected more.

"Pretty good.  I like the floral/leaf design.  It's 15"" which is a size I had a difficult time finding in a decorative bracket (most are much narrower, which limits the size of what you can hang on it).  It's made of cast iron so feels heavy and substantial, not cheap (the main reason I chose it).  I just wish there weren't so many burrs on it.  It seems like it was dipped but not finished off nicely, so up close it has a lot of rough edges/burrs.  You don't see it from far away at all, though, when mounted.  There was no weight limit listed, but it feels strong, though the black screws that came with it could be longer.  We installed it on our porch, into stucco.  It's holding fine so far.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FDVM4IHXNDRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UW4CXG#wasThisHelpful","R1FDVM4IHXNDRC","A6ZPK5DTNPZPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPK5DTNPZPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second pen and I now realize how amazing and really useful it is, after not using it for a while and also comparing it to all my other jewelry cleaners.  This pen is super convenient, doesn't damage precious stones or any metals, doesn't stink, is compact and portable.  Best of all, it makes all my gems sparkle, and I just now figured out how to get my emerald cut 14 yr old engagement diamond ring clean - emerald cuts are beautiful but notorious for their later lack of sparkle, unlike more faceted cuts.  I just figured out that the thin yet stiff bristles of this pen fit neatly underneath the emerald mount on all four sides.  You have to get under stones to really clean them, and this brush fits!  I haven't seen my emerald cut sparkle this much since I last took it to the jeweler for resizing and cleaning.  This pen is amazing.And p.s. I have had no problems with them being dried out.

"This piece is absolutely beautiful, especially considering it's just a piece of plastic.  I bought it thinking I could use it either to store makeup brushes or eyeliner pencils, or nail tools like files, or our thin pairs of reading glasses.  It works for the reading glasses (one thin or rimless pair only), but is a bit small for all but the most minimalist makeup user, and I have discovered that sharp things like scissors, letter openers, cuticle trimmers are not ideal, as they will scratch the plastic easily.  It looks good because it is so pristine, and I'd like it to stay that way.  So I'm going to store it away for now, until I find just the right use for it.  I think that may entail buying another one, facing them back to back, and then storing makeup in them.  I would advise one to think carefully about what one stores in it, as it is narrow and prone to scratching, but as far as looks goes, this is the most beautiful acrylic piece of its kind that I have ever seen.  Love the base and crisp corners.  It looks fantastic on a white office desk.

"These jeans fit comfortably, are basically true to size in the waist/hip/butt (or a little large), but wow the leg is wide.  All the way down.  They truly are a trouser jean.  I have never had on jeans this wide or large.  Interesting cut.  I considered keeping them because they are so unusual, so comfortable, and mostly because the denim is super inky dark beautiful blue and incredibly comfortable (the fabric is incredibly soft).

"This is a great scrub brush.  I use it in the kitchen for pots and to clean the stainless sink.  The bristles are stiff and it lasts a long time.  The head has a straight edge, which, when flipped over, is very useful for scraping surfaces.  I put it in the dishwasher utensil rack often to sterilize it, and this never has any adverse effects like melting.  This Chinese company sells more than one colour of these.  This ""magenta"" is not magenta, technically, but more of an orangey-red.

The sunflower design is pretty, and the colour is a nice dark cool brown, but I do not like how the pushbutton stays permanently lit an orangey-yellow, and in my case ever since the day of installation, I see speckles inside of the button (is mine flawed, or all they all like this?), which cheapens it.

I wanted a fine-rimmed, relatively lightweight bowl that I can eat 1-2 person salads from, mostly.  Large enough for tossing salads, but not so large that you have to eat from a separate smaller bowl.  This was not it.  This bowl is very heavy, substantial, but not in a fine or delicate way the way that crystal is.

"Drop Dead Punk by Rich Zahradnik gives you the feeling of being in New York City during the financial crisis of 1975 when the city was on the verge of bankruptcy. The details really make this book shine. Even though this is the second book in a series, it works very well as a standalone. I love the fact that the author was a reporter in many kinds of media but because he had reported for newspapers, the book felt very realistic.The main character, Coleridge Taylor enjoys his life as a crime reporter and had allowed himself total immersion in his job after a break up with a girlfriend. He was trying to fill a big hole, he knew something was missing in his life but his job came closer than anything to filling that hole.Coleridge was sort of a depressed fellow, everyone at the office knew that the paper that he worked for was ready to fold, and they just didn‚Äôt know when it would happen. He is not the right person to spend his time at City Hall to wait for a reaction from the mayor about President Ford‚Äôs declaration that New York City would not be offered help to save them from bankruptcy. He was bored by that kind of stuff.One thing that was very endearing to me was that Coleridge felt emotional pain but also at times a lot of physical pain. That made me realize that usually male leads in crime mysteries do not complain about physical pain. This one little fact made me fall for this character. He sort of brought out the mother in me!Even he was supposed to spend the day at City Hall, Coleridge called a contact up and got a lead on a crime story. He managed to be at the crime scene at the same time that the investigators were there. He noticed that the policeman had been shot in the face and it would have been almost impossible for the young punk haired man to have shot him. Things don‚Äôt fit. Something smells about this case. The more he checks things out the more that they don‚Äôt fit. Coleridge makes a new friend a badgered female newbie on the force. It took a long time for them to be able to trust each other but they learned how. She would a great character to continue in a third book.The book kept my interest all the way through, I stayed up to midnight finishing it. I did not have an idea about how it would end. One thing that I was positive of and that was that I was on Coleridge Taylor‚Äôs side! I would love to read the next book in this series.I received a finished copy of Drop Dead Punk in exchange for a fair review from the Partners in Crime but that in no way influenced my thoughts or feelings in my revie","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IWU7THM4QK21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DXF20O#wasThisHelpful","R3IWU7THM4QK21","A3VJ27010XUWTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VJ27010XUWTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have long baby fine hair that tends to get oily.  It also tends to look limp. I only have waves if I put them in with a curling iron. I threw my last one aways because I kept getting burned on my neck. So my goal is has changed to adding fullness, feeling clean and having some shine.The smell is light and went away quickly. There were lots of suds, next time, I will use less because it took a while to get all the suds out of my hair.My hair has much more fullness, feels light and clean. It also shines. So I think this shampoo is great for baby fine hair, waves or no waves.

"I thought maybe this would be OK when I sent off for it but it is not for me. When I opened the box, before I even opened the package, the Dawn smell was super strong. I had to back up. I took a roll out and quickly put the other one in the cabinet. Now the whole kitchen cabinet will smell like Dawn!I tried one sheet, ran some water over it and it instantly produced suds. OK so far, so I cleaned my kitchen counter top and was surprised about the amount of suds. Then I had to wet another plain paper towel to get rid of the suds. I think there just too many suds for my liking. I put the roll of Dawn infused towels back into the cabinet. We use the dishwasher to clean our dishes so I am not sure what to use them for, our bathtub requires heavy duty cleaner because of the stains from the water.

"This is a puzzling book to review! I definitely want to read more of Ace Collins‚Äô books after finishing The Color of Justice about a half hour ago. The author kept my attention and I enjoyed the characters although they were a wee bit stereotyped.  It is a story set in a small town, Justice, Mississippi, mostly in 1964.  I can remember that time period very well and I think that he captured the feelings of the times very well. The town was divided into black and white. I grew up in the North but I remember going to a school for whites and I later discovered that there was also a school for blacks. It brought back memories for me. I am glad that Ace Collins knew how to trigger those memories.The lawyer in this tale Coop Lindsey, had to go through some uncomfortable soul searching before he decided to take on defending a young black teenager who had been charged with murder of a young white woman in town. I liked the way the author tied Coop‚Äôs upbringing by his preacher father to his decision to risk being hated by the town‚Äôs white population.  This book had a ‚Äúmovie‚Äù quality to it and it was easy for me to imagine Kevin Costner playing Coop Lindsey.I love the character of Hattie, although also stereotyped, the boy‚Äôs aunt who pleads for his chance to have fair trial. I think I felt at home with these people and recognized good qualities of my old relatives in them. But the town‚Äôs name of Justice seemed to be a little too much when a major theme in this book is in fact Justice!Also, I did not like how things fit together a little too neatly at the end. But on the whole, I enjoyed this book and think the author might have been better off in not tying up all the ends. That would be more like life, having some secrets that never are discovered but effect the character‚Äôs peace of mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYBMF39UPOF29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426770030#wasThisHelpful","RYBMF39UPOF29","A3VJ27010XUWTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VJ27010XUWTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is strong. I followed the directions and put it on last night and it is still going strong. It is in the 100s this week in Texas so I really do need it. When it is hot, I sweat a lot and the smell is not good.I had two problems with it. It has a baby powder scent which is slightly overwhelming. I have never liked that smell so I when I buy, this I definitely will try a different scent. Secondly, it was difficult for me to get the the creamy stuff to start to come out. At first, I tried turning the wheel clockwise, nothing happened, then I went counter-clockwise. After a lot of turnings back and forth a little started to come out. I was worried that something was not connected so I could not use it. But I went on-line and found another review that indicated the same problem. OK, so it was not broken. I continued to turn it back and forth. Finally, it came out.The product works very well, I just don't favor the smell and wonder if they could have made it easier to get it started.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XTNNSCQ9LTVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q70QKT2#wasThisHelpful","R2XTNNSCQ9LTVU","A3VJ27010XUWTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VJ27010XUWTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great notebook with a lot of helpful features. I remember when I was in college. I always looked for 150 pages, college ruled divided notebooks. Now I use them for projects and notes on a book that I will be reviewing.When hunting for a notebook, I also spent time debating on which ones would have the spiral binder that would later snag my sweaters. Hated that! Now Five Star has solved that problem with material covering the spiral on the side so it is impossible to snap. There is a 3"" by 1"" space where you could put your name with a black marker pen. Also on the side there is a handy loop where you can put your pen so you are all ready to go when you get to class.Another thing that used to irritate me is that I would take lots of notes for some classes and less for others so I had to use paper that was beyond the divider. That problem is gone now. I watch the video at the top to see how to remove them. When I received this notebook, the first thing I did was to take out the first divider. It was as easy as in the video. Putting them back, I had to learn to skip the first loop of the spiral and the divider went in quickly.Each divider has a 3/4 pocket on each side of it so you can hold lots of notes, class outlines and whatever else you accumulate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZBLN2IUI3768/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7X2K9Q#wasThisHelpful","RZBLN2IUI3768","A3VJ27010XUWTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VJ27010XUWTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My eyes are poor so I struggled against the very small print to read a fascinating book of lessons that men coming from Jordan Downs in Watts taught themselves. This book pulled me into the world of the men of Watts and would not let me go. Each chapter seems like an intimate group therapy session as the men worked hard to define what a good father was and how to keep their children from making the mistakes that they had made.Years ago, the author stayed in her uncle‚Äôs home and they watched Watts burn and being looted. Her uncle taught her about the system being against them and that the riots were expected. Many years later, Jorja Leap and Big Mike Cummings co-lead the original group of Project Fatherhood. The men signing up could get gift cards and information on how to parent.Not having a father was the norm in this area. The men asked themselves, how could they know how to be a father without ever having one? As many sad stories of neglect, absent fathers, and child abuse poured out, the men were challenged to find out what being a good father means. And it was very difficult so they had to help each other. They had to learn to trust each other and to feel that they were fathers in group.The author had to learn their lingo and also realize that their mores were different. She had to push them to help themselves.This book is very inspiring, it shows that together, even there were no best solutions to the problems, the group could work together to find alternatives that would work better than those tried before.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in what makes a good father and how difficult the problems are when living in a poor area without job opportunities and enormous challenges every day.I received a finished copy from the publishers as a win from LibraryThing in exchange for a fair review. That in no way influenced my thoughts or feelings in this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MB9KVCWAN338/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NKDI80I#wasThisHelpful","R2MB9KVCWAN338","A3VJ27010XUWTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VJ27010XUWTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the Glad ForceFlex Tall Kitchen Bags that we have been using since they first came out. Our trash seems to be mostly paper and thin plastic (water bottles) so none of it is very heavy. So what we need is a bag that will hold a large quantity of trash but not necessarily heavy trash. We used to recycle the empty plastic bottles and metal drink cans but there is no way that we can do that where we now live. Anyway, this bad is exactly the right size for use.I like force flex crinkly texture. It is always easy to sneak in one last bit of trash after the drawstring has already been tied because it stretches. I noticed that the drawstring also has the same kind of crinkly texture. Unfortunately, I don't have enough trash to try out the drawstring yet. But the bags without the textured drawstring are a bit slippery so that should help holding onto it,The main improvement though is the odor shield. We live in Texas and next week we will hahve over 100 heat next week. Now imagine what it is going to smell like when that trash bad is placed outside our apartment door!

"The smell is wonderful. I have always loved the scent of ripe mandarin oranges, they remind me of Christmas. My mother used to keep a bowl of them on the kitchen table for snacking. There is also a faint smell of tiare flower in there too. Dove have always been my favorite bath wash and I was excited to be allowed to try this one.After showering, my skin felt moisturized. I have extremely dry skin so that really helps. The scent goes away after you shower but when you first open the flip top lid, you instantly smell the mandarin oranges. It is true aroma therapy.The price is great and if comes in a big 22 ounce bottle.My only question is why they had to add yellow #5 coloring to it.

So, I am reviewing for the non-baby segment of bath wash users. The first thing that I noticed about the description ‚ÄúNatural, allergy free‚Äù. That is not to say that you may be allergic to something that is natural but at least this bath wash avoids the most common culprits in bath washes. I did not break out after using it!I like idea that it does not have color added to it. The smell is great, lavender. I also love the shape of the bottle.

"We received this tube-free toilet paper this afternoon. I never thought it could be sold without the tube. When I was in grade school we used to collect the tube and make something that looked like a candle for the holidays but usually I can never think of another way to recycle them. So this is a great idea. Less waste for us to throw away. We live in apartment and we don't want to be embarrassed by the size of our trash bag!  The package says that it is 40% recycled paper so I love that.The paper itself is thicker than the other Scott toilet paper that we still have. It is embossed with a design and grooves. It is only one ply but it doesn't need to have more. It is strong and will do the job very well. It is shorter across but will last a lot longer than rolls from Dollar type stores. It is white so there is no color added and no scent added so that is safer. It is also very absorbent.One thing I noticed is that it is not as soft as regular Scott do I would still buy some Cottonelle or Angel Soft if I am prepping for a colonoscopy when you really need extra softness.  Also the package is two rolls wide which is too wide for our storage in our bathrooms.

Drop it into the largest empty part of the tank. Do not stand over it and breathe in the odor!Store the tablets in a place where children cannot get into it.

"These are very different from the vintage kitchen dish towels that I practiced my first embroidery on when I was a child. They do not need any decoration in fact they will make your kitchen prettier. The dish towels are much prettier when you see them in person than in the picture because then you can see the details.Just throw them into the washer and maybe use a light iron. They would be the best dish towels to have out when company comes.  Or don‚Äôt iron them if there is no company coming! They are much bigger than I am used too but that is good because if one part of the towel gets too wet, just use a different part.Also on the reverse side on one of the top corners is a bad that you can use for handing it up. They are very soft and much heavier than the old fashioned dish towels.This set would make a great house warming gift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31FXMFX5CWJ3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DU6UMWM#wasThisHelpful","R31FXMFX5CWJ3A","A3VJ27010XUWTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VJ27010XUWTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never bought adult diapers. I just wanted to see how they compare to the disposable underpants for women.  I have had some nerve damage that is making my incontinence problem worse. These are definitely diapers only much bigger. The first thing that I noticed is that the tabs which do stick and can be re-stuck are rather tiny for someone who has arthritis or the caretaker who has arthritis. Also, these are much more bulky. So if you are going to take them with you on a plane, count on them taking up a lot of your suitcase.They are made in America, I do like that. I do think it is time to start asking people who have to wear them what they want. They are very hard to put on compared to the pull on briefs. Also, these are uncomfortably hot. Feels like wearing a plastic although cushioned bag. They had me sweating in about tens. That is not good. The paper is not breathable and will be causing a lot of people who have to wear them rashes and possibly skin infections. That wasn't a problem with the ultra-comfortable pull on briefs.One plus is that they prevent odor and they did not add a scent which could create problems with the heat. So they don't smell.The pull on briefs are a much more suitable solution to incontinence as long as you can still put on the pull-on briefs go with them. I also think that type of material that this is made above is less absorbent. The briefs pull the liquid away from and are less likely to cause a urinary infection.I really think that with the retention of heat and possible skin irritations, whoever wears them will not be a happy camper.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30L7P5IES5M2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NNEPEG#wasThisHelpful","R30L7P5IES5M2M","A3VJ27010XUWTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VJ27010XUWTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are non-toxic and wash off easily. If you are like me, you get carried away sometimes and make a stray mark on your hand or arm. I tested it. I made an orange mark on my hand it was gone in an instant when I ran water over it.I went through all of the different markers smelling them. I love the grape, cherry, apple, mint, and licorice but don't care for the scent of the wild blackberry (light blue) and banana (yellow). I couldn't smell the chocolate. Going to have some fun.

"For the amount and the cost of Minor's Teriyaki Sauce is an excellent buy.The main drawback to me is that it tastes too sweet. It only has 7 grams of sugar but when I taste it the sugar what I first taste. I think the recipe could be greatly improved with half the brown sugar and more onion powder and the addition of other spices to bring out the flavor. With those changes, I think that more would be sold. To me this is a westernized sauce by that I mean it has too much sweetness and not enough zing!There are multiple uses for me, especially when I add some Asian spices to it.

"The Last Witness by Jerry Amernic was inspired by the time he saw the numbers on the arm of a woman at a Jewish Bakery that his father used to take him to as a child. I was older when I first saw the tattoo of numbers on a man‚Äôs arm. Having read many books about the Holocaust, I always wonder about how is it possible that there are still survivors of those who were in death camps. Jerry Amernic provides one of the best answer.Jack Fischer aka Jacob Klukowsky is the vehicle for that answer. At the beginning of the book he is 100 years old and believed to be the last survivor of the Holocaust. Why is this book set in the future? The author can see signs that the Holocaust is being forgotten or diminished in its importance. One thing that this book brings up that is different from many books on the Holocaust is that recognizes that the Nazis forced many into ghettos. Jacob was only four years old living in a closed ghetto (walled off from the rest of Lodz, Poland. There was overcrowding, disease and hunger. This was the stage before the death camps. Jerry Amernic flashes back and forth from different points in Jack‚Äôs life and to 2035 in New York City with great ease.Jack Fischer‚Äôs great granddaughter, Christine, a school teacher with a love for history is shocked with the trend to cover less and less of the Holocaust in the textbooks. Jack had not told his children of what his life had been like but he shared what happened with his great granddaughter. She fights to get the full history in the school books.This book does have some mystery which becomes more apparent at the end but I think it is more of a crossover book with historical fiction. This book makes you think. When I was growing up, we heard nothing about the Holocaust. It was my father who brought me the book by Anne Frank that introduced me to the subject. Also, we need to think about recognizing all genocide, about what we can do to prevent it. We need to think about what leads to it, racial slurs, putting down people who are different from the majority, to not really listening to people who are verbally threatening others because they need to be prevented from action.I received an Advance copy of The Last Witness by Jerry Amernic in exchange for a fair review from the Partners in Crime but that in no way influenced my thoughts or feelings in my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BPSXWWJ29Z9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1S0SNK#wasThisHelpful","R1BPSXWWJ29Z9R","A3VJ27010XUWTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VJ27010XUWTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Devil Eye by Rebecca Jean Downey is one of the most exciting and amazing thriller books that I have read!There were times that I held onto the book so hard while immersed in reading about the dangerous situations. In one of those times, there are many, I had to laugh out loud because, as I was reading the character was also gripping something hard at the same time. I have never had that happen before!The story starts with a U.S. Marshall asking Penny Larkin to help stop a sale of guns going to Mexico. S She is supposed find Juan Rico who got mixed up in the Mexican cartel‚Äôs gunrunning. She has to keep the mission secret even from her boyfriend, Leo Tellez, El Paso County Sheriff.Penny has remote viewing skills. She can study objects, pictures and videos to get a mental image. And that gives her information that she needs for tracking. She also has so much determination and moxie that you cannot help but admire her. The writing is so vivid that I felt like I was right there with her all the time. It was very easy to imagine her and worry about her. The author uses all the senses to make it easy to feel that you are with the characters, even down to the sweat under their clothes.This book has a little bit of a paranormal twist and I usually don‚Äôt feel comfortable with paranormal books but it was played up that much so please still consider reading it if paranormal is not your genre.The situations are a reflection of the research that the author did about a similar thing that happened in a small town in New Mexico. The author refers that in her Introduction and gives some background information about the history of gunrunning between the U.S. and Mexico.I learned so much about gunrunning and cartels that felt that I had almost experienced it first-hand.Not only do I look forward to her next book but I can hardly wait for more.I received a copy of Devil Eye by Rebecca Jean Downey in exchange for a fair review from the Partners in Crime but that in no way influenced my thoughts or feelings in my review","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGL5GQNEVRUTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162994534X#wasThisHelpful","RGL5GQNEVRUTZ","A3VJ27010XUWTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VJ27010XUWTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted to try this out because it says ""pure"" instead of imitation almond extract. I do have a small bottle of one ounce of Durkee Imitation Almond Extract to compare it with. The McCormick Pure Almond Extract is 8 ounces and the other is only one ounce. Unfortunately, I do not remember how much the imitation cost.The ingredients are similar except that the Durkee had imitation almond oil in it. Neither one has sugar or corn sugar in them. But when I smell them, the imitation smells more like cherries than almonds and the McCormick smells more like almonds.I added a little of McCormick Almond Extract to my cherry protein shake for a bit of almond flavor. It was very tasty. I had made one before without the extract with the protein powder, frozen cherries and almond mild and three ice cubes. There was a difference! This one had more almond flavor.

"My brother is a severely autistic adult who lives in a group home out of state. Even though he needs a great deal of supervision there are certain things that bring joy to him. Taking care of his hair, and showering and getting ready in the morning is one of the things that he takes pride in. I buy gifts for his birthday and Christmas and cards throughout the year. I picked this for my husband as a test drive to see if it would do for a gift for my brother. I usually send a group of gifts and it is great to get a package of three things at once. That way he will have a bigger group of things to open. He will also have more of his small monthly spending money leftover if he doesn't have to buy the basics.The deodorant, shampoo with conditioner and body and face wash all have a strong smell with you open them.

"I have always used Hefty Extra Strong Bags for left collection. They are large enough to hold a lot of leaves. My mother used them before I did, so I just copied her.

"The taste by itself is great and is also great in smoothies or even my coffee, I use a teaspoon or less and it is just enough to add to the flavor of the coffee but not overpowering the coffee flavor.  It is a little gritty, to be expected, and does settle to the bottom so you will want to make sure you swirl the cup to get it all.As we get older our bodies do not process protein as easily so it is a good idea to supplement your diet with some protein powder, I like to use a different protein source everyday and Vega Sport Performance is a great addition to my rotation.  If you are also trying to lose weight protein powders are also very important because protein is what makes everything in your body function properly, diets can often deprive you of necessary protein.  As we get older it is harder for us to build and maintain muscle and don't forget the heart is a muscle also and supplementing with a protein powder can help with muscle development.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6HFXDA7HQRTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016D9IGES#wasThisHelpful","R6HFXDA7HQRTM","A2UQIQUOAB47OT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQIQUOAB47OT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The guide is big and colorful on high quality semi-glossy paper.  I'm not sure I would have titled it ""2016"" since it does not include this years sports games and other recent releases.  Many of the games included have been out for quite awhile, not necessarily a bad thing since they are most of the most popular games.  There is some info on games some may have not heard of such as ""Cities Skylines"" that Simcity fans should check out.I would consider the book more almanac than I would game guide, there are a lot of mostly subjective lists and really most of the game info is basic stuff.  The guide is dominated by bright and colorful pictures which take up most of the space.  When I selected the book the information said over 800 pages and even considered actually buying the book but now knowing that it is only 224 pages I knew the information would be basic stuff and would not be interested in buying it.

"Just kidding. Our mother did not want to spend a lot on a hearing aid so these were the perfect solution for her.  We tried several different kinds and this design from NewEar was the one she preferred, many different sellers sell the same design. They are better in isolated situations and don't work as well in situations with a lot of extraneous noise. The only problem is they are a one size fits all which means they are more suited for medium to larger ears.  Our mother has small ears, she always uses the small buds but in order for the ear piece to fit in her ear there is a considerable curve/bend in the wire and this inevitably means the wire breaks, she goes through one every 6 to 12 months.  The good news is that the price of these has dropped considerably over the last few years.Just wanted to add that there is a hard plastic piece that you attach the soft ear gel to, that hard plastic piece is supposed to be glued on, we have found sometimes we receive it where it is not glued on.  When you get your hearing aid make sure that hard plastic piece is glued on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31DWXGAKT71N6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CH8FUC6#wasThisHelpful","R31DWXGAKT71N6","A2UQIQUOAB47OT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQIQUOAB47OT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"(sample supplied for review purposes)Consider my rating 4 1/2 stars.The first thing I want to address is the charging problem some have and it has to do with one thing, it uses USB which requires it to be charged from a computer(trickle charge) and some outlet chargers. Some have mentioned that with this version and others they are only able to get about a half an hour to an hour worth of play time. If you charge it from a computer you will get 6 to 7 hours or more depending on what you are using it for.I really like the dark red metallic color, it is not just cool looking it is also easy to spot when you set it down.This unit has the 32 GB built in, there are other versions that have a micro SD card slot that come with a 16 GB SD card. So depending how much you want to do with it you will have to decide what is best for you but 32 GB internal storage is a lot and will be enough for most.Let's start with the packaging and honestly this might be my biggest negative but really didn't effect my rating. It comes in a two part clear plastic case wrapped in glued on cellophane. Don't try to remove the cellophane, take a knife and slice along the sides where the two pieces of plastic come together, slice along the two long sides and the bottom short side, you will feel your knife slightly enter the slot along the sides. By leaving the top side connected you will have a flip open case.The player itself fits my needs perfectly, mostly for walking and listening to music and audio books. I got over 4 hours of playing time using it for that and probably had more but decided to charge the player, I don't like to let the battery get to low. The player does so much more than play audio files, there are even 4 games included but watching video and playing games might not be the best things to use the player for because of the small screen size but you can, pictures and video quality were very good. You can also record what you are listening to on the radio to or use it as a voice recorder. The radio worked great and the reception was surprisingly good. My only real negative was the bass with the supplied ear buds was not very good even at the rock setting on the equalizer but I rarely get good bass out of ear buds, the bass was a lot better with an over the ear pair of headphones.The player was very intuitive, I never did look at the instructions and only encountered a few minor bumps in the road that I eventually figured out. The interface has a quaint old school pixelated look but really was a non issue for me. For my needs it was perfect and is very highly recommended for those with similar needs to mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S4S9Y0KE3X2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z91DA48#wasThisHelpful","R2S4S9Y0KE3X2G","A2UQIQUOAB47OT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQIQUOAB47OT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good about the iron is how fast it gets hot, it is easily the best iron we have ever used when it comes to how fast it gets hot, the days of waiting for your iron to get hot are over.  Another good thing about the iron is the steam and spritz function.  You can use the steam function in the horizontal or vertical position, so you can use it as wrinkle steamer for hanging garments.  The spritz function also works well for what I would describe as the ideal amount of water that comes out.  Ironing with the D3030 is a pleasure, it does its job well.The bad is putting water in the iron.  It has a little door you open to add the water, the problem is you have to add the water while the iron lays flat because you can't really add the water in the vertical position.  Another reason you need to add water in the horizontal position is the fill line is oriented for the horizontal position.  The problem with the fill line is it is on the dark opaque plastic so you practically need a flashlight to tell how much water you have added.  Obviously the problem with filling the tank in the horizontal position is the water gradually leaks out so once you are done filling you need to stand the iron up immediately.  Ultimately this is a minor annoyance that you get used to.  Once you have the water in everything works as it should.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PXNYYAMSPKSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5ILD0K#wasThisHelpful","R1PXNYYAMSPKSB","A2UQIQUOAB47OT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQIQUOAB47OT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have a similar Crayola version that didn't make much sense and was plagued by problems.  This Barbie version makes much more sense but is also plagued by some of the same problems.The consistency of the spray is inconsistent, while this may sometimes add an artistic element it is not ideal.  What is nice are the stencils and are practically a must because of the inconsistency of the spray.  Even when the spray comes out properly the colors themselves will have a washed out look but not as bad as pictured, they look better in person.  There are also additional kits with more designs which increases the re-playability of the toy.What hurts the re-playability is it requires 4 AA batteries.

"This is the first step to that future but it will not be long before we will all be living those science fiction movies.  The biggest hurdle Echo faces is getting people used to the inevitable change in lifestyle for all of us.  I have no doubt that a contractor version is already in the works where as your house is built the contractor version is installed and we will have Echo access everywhere in the house.When I first got our Echo the implications of this technology hit me like a ton of bricks.  Ironically the technology involved itself has been available for over a decade, there is really nothing new here but it took the foresight of Amazon to put it all together.  As I started thinking about what we would be able to do with Echo I had to stop after about 10 or 15 minutes because the ideas just kept coming, it really was a revelation.Initially what you were able to do with Echo was rather limited, really mostly just music applications but Amazon has been steadily adding some functions but I think the majority of future functions will be available in apps where you pick and choose the ones you want.  I do think inevitably this app model will become obsolete as Echo will be able to do everything we want without picking and choosing select apps.Right now the best thing Echo does is accessing music, whether in your Amazon music library, through free prime music or genre radio stations and honestly is worth it by itself, especially if you are a Prime member.  The speaker for music is great and also works with Bluetooth.  The voice recognition was pretty good at the start and has improved.  A recent addition to functionality is the ability to reorder things previously ordered on Amazon.  Another great function is the shopping list which combined with the Echo app on your phone is quite a useful application and one we have used many times already.Your interaction with Echo is through ""Alexa"", she is a prim and proper lady that you can have a lot of fun with and not limited to just telling jokes.  She really is an information center, including dictionary, encyclopedia, weather, news and more.  Echo really is a platform and not just for applications, as we speak products have been produced and are being produced that will function with Echo.  It won't be long where you will be able to initiate macros, such as getting up in the morning and saying ""Alexa good morning"" which would initiate the morning macro, with things such as asking you if you would like hear the news, weather or starting the coffee maker and more, or just automatically going through these things and you would also be able to interrupt, you get the idea.I'm sure you are starting to see the implications yourself and the future uses are flooding your mind also. It wouldn't surprise me if they had some limited brain sensor functionality within 10 years where you could use your thought to make a choice.  Don't wait, get yours now and get used to this inevitable lifestyle change, the sooner the better.  When Echo first came out many complained that all it did was play music, I imagine it will not be long before we forget that Echo just happens to play music also.  Welcome to the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ZMKBYVN4I7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9EOQCO#wasThisHelpful","R37ZMKBYVN4I7P","A2UQIQUOAB47OT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQIQUOAB47OT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"(sample supplied for review purposes)This is a very simple looking holder that does not look very impressive but don't judge this book by its cover.  This may look unimpressive but it is probably the best mount I have ever used.  It is hard to get around a pole or handle but that is what makes it so secure.  It is also hard to get the phone in but this also is why it is so secure.  This will easily hold over a 3 inch wide phone and you probably could even get a 4 inch wide phone in and can easily hold a 2 inch wide phone or less.  Get this mount, you will not regret it.

"The vibration and buzz can be a little intense at first and takes a little getting used to on the cleaning setting. The vibration and buzz is a little less intense on the sensitive setting.  It's possible the vibration and buzz may actually strengthen your teeth.  The cleaning is very good especially if used with a whitening toothpaste, works amazing and you will probably see results with the first brushing.  The brush works great on the front of the teeth but is a little difficult cleaning the inside of the teeth and is hard not to rattle your teeth when the hard parts of the brush touch your teeth.  It is very easy to charge and the charger has a small footprint and does not take up a lot of space.  The travel case and small charger make this very portable and great for traveling but considering the brush holds a charge for two weeks at twice a day brushing you might not even need to take the charger with you. A four pack of replacement brushes costs nearly thirty dollars Remington SFR401 Sonic Fresh Rechargeable Toothbrush Replacement Head, 4 Count, White but hopefully they might be discounted sometimes or maybe some second party replacements are made and less expensive. For me I don't see using this twice a day as recommended, probably just a couple times a week to get a good whitening and using a regular toothbrush the rest of the time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JC5MWFR0V1UN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NELG47U#wasThisHelpful","R2JC5MWFR0V1UN","A2UQIQUOAB47OT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQIQUOAB47OT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"...maybe a little of both.  I always worry a little about translations, more times than not there are problems and that is definitely what I felt here but figured since he was an international bestselling author I figured I would give it a shot.  The book had a little bit of a quirky tone and honestly thought it was a little boring, I think this may have been a product of the translation more than anything. One of the best translations I ever read was The Club Dumas, which I read when it came out and long before it was made into the movie The Ninth Gate.There were also a lot of similar Belgian names that were difficult to keep track of but having read enough books by Umberto Eco and others I don't let that stop me even though it sometimes involves going back and refreshing my memory.

"Nathanael Green's book titled FASCISM: AN ANTHOLOGY contained a collection of essay excerpts to ""come to grips"" with the political concept of Fascism. These excerpts dealt with disparate Fascist parties and movement and showed that Fascism had wide spread support in Europe and in the US. Some of the essays dealt with the international phenomena of Fascism while others focused on specific national Fascist nationalist movements and trends.George Mosse's essay made clear that by 1936, every European nation and the US had Fascist parties or movements some of which were splinter movements. Mosse should have been more specific re the international aspect of Fascism. Such examples could have included Mosley's British Union of Fascists, the Belgium Rexists, the French Action Francaise, the Romanian Iron Guard, and other Fascist groups outside of Italy and Germany.Ernst Nolte's excerpt was taken from his interesting book titled THE THREE FACES OF FASCISM. Nolte emphasized that the one phenomena that united the Fascists was fear of Big Communism. The Fascists were nothing if they were not anti-Communists. Fears ofBig Communism were very real in Central and Eastern Europe. Nolte remembered an attempted Communist revolution in Germany in 1919 which almost claimed the life of the future Pope Pius XII and was only crushed when German troops crushed this attempted revolution. Nolte cited Franz Borkenau (1900-1957) who, interestingly enough, wrote that the biggest purge of Communists occurred in the Soviet via Stalin & co. Except for Lenin's wife, everyone of Lenin's loyal supporters were purged and murdered mostly by the Show Trials in the 1930s. The German Reichstag Fire in 1934 caused a genuine fear of Big Communism, and the trial of van Der Lubbe, a Dutch Communist, proved that he committed the arson alone.As Dennis Mack Smith wrote in a following essay, Mussolini & co. used bogus fears of Big Communism in Italy. The Italians were mostly devout Catholics, and the Communist fear was indeed bogus as Smith noted. In fact, Mussolini, as A. Rossi cited, admitted that his rise to power was in part based on such bogus fears. As A.J.P. Taylor noted in his book THE ORIGINS OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, the revolution that from which Mussolini saved the Italians was bogus and nonexistent.Often, apprehensively historians have equated Fascism with anti-Antisemitism. This is not true. The Belgium Rexists were not antisemitic and were not racists. Mussolini was not antisemitic and only catered to Hitler with some restrictions on Italian Jews. On the other hand, the alleged virulent anti-Fascist, Joseph Stalin, organized mass arrests and mass murder of Jews along the same lines that Hitler & co. were blamed.George Orwell wrote that historians and social scientists either clearly define Fascism or stop using Fascism as a political description or stop using the term. This reviewer's view is that Fascism was a response and NOT an ideology. The Fascists responded to the following:Disillusion to WW I (winners and losers)Failure to correct the problems of The Great DepressionThe perceived disintegration of social norms and stabilityFears of Big CommunismOne should note that without the rise of Big Communism, Fascism may not have emerged. As noted in this review, Fascism was not the same as conservatism. Franco disbanded his Falangists as soon as the Spanish Civil War was over (1936-1939). One could read Marx, Engles, Lenin, Trotsky, and company to get the roots of Communism. However, no one can trace any roots of Fascism Vain attempts have been made to claim that St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) and Martin Luther (1483-1546) were precursors of Fascism. However no one can make any accurate claim of Fascist ideology.This collection of excerpts help eliminate emotional responses to Fascism. During the 1920s and early 1930s Fascism was a political approval word because of the paranoia over Big Communism. One defect of the book was that the historians mentioned in this anthology did not mention Fascist economic policy which was one reason for Fascist success in the midst of The Great Depression. Still this book is a useful tool to gain a better understanding of Fascism which apprehensively conventional historians refuse to  seriously consider.James E.

"David Starkey' book titled MAGNA CARTA: THE MEDIEVAL ROOTS OF MODERN POLITICS is a well written account Medieval English political and legal history. Starkey clarified the complex issues and identified the ""players"" who were involved during the reign of King John (1199-1216) who was eventually forced to put his seal on Magna Carta.The early sections of the book dealt with John's loss of Henry II's (1154-1189) Angevin Empire at the Battle of Bovines in 1214. This basically ended English hopes for any control in France until the Hundred Years War (1346-1453). So, as Starkey so clearly showed, King John focused on solidifying his control over the English nobility as well as the Welsh and the Irish. John had 28 Welsh hanged for alleged treason and tried to intimidate other English nobility via treachery, broken promises, and betrayal of loyal supporters.Such actions alienated the English nobles who FINALLY decided to act to protect their interests and their rights. As Starkey noted, the English nobility and Bishop Langton were not idealists but practical men whose ""heads were not in the clouds but their feet were firmly planted on the ground."" In other words, the English nobility were aware of what they wanted and knew how to get it. John did not understand his opposition and how practical and determined they were.When John agreed to the terms of Magna Carta, the romantic historians got their history wrong. Artists depicted John signing the Magna Carta, but John was illiterate. Also English documents were sealed and not signed. The myth that John signed the entire Magna Carta document was exploded. John only sealed the outlines of Magna Carta. The entire Magna Carta is about 4,000 words long, and scribes need time to complete the document which took considerable time given the fact that Magna Carta was written well before the invention of the printing press. Starkey mentioned that the English nobility formed an alliance with Henry III (1216-1272) who made a radical movement and a ""weak"" monarch a conservative tendency. Edward I agreed with the terms of Magna Carta which both enshrined the document and gave Edward credibility.When King John died in the midst political turmoil, his short will showed a congenial side to the nefarious monarch. John apologized to the families of people whom he harmed, apologized to those who survived John's persecutions, and he left considerable sums to help the poor and needy. This may fit that there is something good in the worst of us, or John's conscience bothered him.After John's death, English monarchs and nobility both pledged to uphold Magna Carta. While the English turned a radical document into a conservative political establishment, but the English were smart enough to make a  conservative political arrangement into a practical political system that worked for centuries. Starkey made a depressing assessment re the Magna Carta and history. As Starkey noted, British and American citizens do not know or care about Magna Carta, the US Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.One minor weakness of Starkey's book is that he could have mentioned the influence of the Catholic Church's Canon Law. The Catholic Canon Law jurists introduced par legum (due process) into legal practice. Starkey should have mentioned that the Catholic Church's Fourth Lateran Council introduced trial by jury which was not part of English Constitutional History until the reign of Edward I (1272-1307) which obviously was later than the Fourth Lateran Council.Starkey concluded the book with interesting photo plates and careful outlines of the paragraphs of Magna Carta. The outlines are easy to following and some have a ""familiar ring"" re the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights. One could argue that the US Constitution and Bill of Rights have the British Constitution written all over it. Starkey clearly made this connection. Those interested in English History will like this book which is well written and well organized.James E.

"Reza Aslan wrote an interesting book that provided readers with a practical history of the ""origins"" of Christianity. Aslan provided a clear explanation of the religious and political tensions within Judaism and the messianic fanaticism against the Romans. The cross currents of disputes among the Jewish priestly class and poor Jews was complicated by a nationalistic/religious opposition to the Romans whose authority was seen as an insult to the people and, as they viewed it, an insult to God.Readers may know of the different sects in Judea. The Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and ""Zealots,"" who should not be confused with the later Zealot Party. As Aslan informed his readers the temple priests were often bitterly resented by poorer Jews. These priests crushed many of the poor with taxes and lavish life styles. The priests' hypocrisy and exorbitant demands for fees and tithes were obvious, and the temple taxes were oppressive. As Aslan noted, this explained the a few assassinations of these priests.In the milieu of these tensions, messianic  leaders and their fanatical supporters emerged to challenge the religious and political status quo often with disastrous results. Aslan mentioned Hezekiah the Bandit Leader, Judas the Galilean, Simon son of Giora, Simon son of Kochba, plus others. These men led rebellions that were lethal to their followers. The Temple priests were resented due to their support for the Roman authorities. In fact, the Roman authorities relied on the Temple priests to help maintain ""peace and quiet.""Christ and his supporters are seen in the middle of these bitter disputes. Christ and his followers were largely ignored until, as Aslan wrote, they got closer to and entered Jerusalem. A good point was that seemingly innocuous comments were viewed with serious political overtones. Christ's remark abut rending unto Caesar what is Caesar's and render to God what is God's. The question of what belonged to God was seen as the land of Judea which was a direct threat to the Romans and Temple priests. Another threat to the Temple priests was Christ's exorcism or healing which undermined the expensive Temple purification rituals which included lavish fees and dues. Christ's healing was free which precluded all of the expensive ritual payments.Another thesis of the book was the status of John the Baptist. As the Gospel writers wrote about John the Baptist, his status was gradually reduced as the chronology of the Gospels were written. Aslan had interesting material on James the Just whose name appears as the author of the Book of James. Later rabbis argued that the Temple was destroyed because the Chief Priest Ananus had James executed in 62 AD.The earliest ""Christians"" centered their movement in Jerusalem which came into conflict with St. Paul and his missionary work among ""Gentiles"" or the Greek and Latin language people outside of Judea. These tensions are reflected in the New Testament Epistles. The ""Gentiles"" were the final winners when the Temple, the center of Judean worship, was destroyed in 70 AD. Thereafter, as Aslan noted, Christianity became an international religion which this reviewer noted is hinted in some of the Tanak or Old Testament Prophets.Obviously, the Greek and Latin world had various differences most of which were resolved at the Council of Nicea in 325 AD when Constantine (306-330 AD) wanted a resolution of these differences before such differences became serious political problems disrupting political unity which was emerging in the late Roman Empire. Aslan's conclusion was that Christianity today is not the same set of concepts during Ancient History.Reza Aslan wrote a readable account separting ""theology"" from history. He clarified the complex differences in Ancient Judea the effect these differences had in biblical literature and religious sectarian rivalry. Aslan included a good index and bibliography. As an aside, producing an index can be ""soul destroying"" work.James E.

"Thomas Woods' book titled REAL DISSENT is a historically accurate antidote to the ""conservatives"" and the cowardly war party. Woods value is that he writes very well, and he knows actual history and bona fide sources. While some readers may place Woods as a ""neocon,"" he is certainly is not. While this reviewer does not agree with all of Woods' views, Woods presentations are logical, and he is articulate.Woods wasted no time in attacking the neocons and the ""liberals"" strait jacket avenues of debate. The apprehensively conventional view that political debate should be confined to Romney, Clinton, and Obama agendas is shattered by Woods book. An amusing view of the neocons is that they whine about socialism and communism. Yet, these same neocons want a Soviet Leninist-Stalinist police state to undermine their badly distorted views of history. Woods cites ""chapter and verse"" the contradictory neocon views and confusion. Police state spying and attempts to stifle truth are exposed in Woods' book, and the ""Establishment"" is uncomfortable with Woods to say the least.Both Democrats and Republicans have expanded the war state. Without knowing who the ""enemy"" is at any given moment, all they can do is talk about bombing people regardless of innocent unarmed civilians including women and children. Between 1988-1991, US forces destroyed Iraq's water purification system which cost the lives of approximately five hundred thousand children because US authorities did not like Saddam Hussein. Then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright actually justified such tragedy.Woods could have made this more of an issue. Readers should know that between 1980-1988, Russian, West German, and US authorities armed Hussein and help him fight the Iranians in a long deadly war which no one won. The lies that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction were later undermined. In 1988, US forces helped the US Navy intervened on Hussein's behalf against the Iraqis. Yet three short years later, Hussein became the ""bad guy."" The Orwellian overtones are too obvious to ignore.Later in 2001, US forces ousted Hussein, and, as Woods noted, one neocon boasted that US forces should destroy anyone just to do it without any moral imperative. In other words, diplomacy should be based on evil impulse rather than rational policy.When US policy makers were warned about the different political factions in Western Asia, the ignorant government officials dismissed such warning and marginalized anyone who told the truth.Older conservatives such as Russel Kirk who were ""the darlings of conservatism,"" are now condemned by the neocons. Woods noted that Kirk and older conservatives warned  that war destroyed civilized behavior which is now epidemic both overseas and in the US. Woods cited ""The Founding Fathers"" who were against standing armies, imperialism, and militarism. Now the neocons hate such great men because the views of ""The Founding Fathers"" undermine ""Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace."" In fact, some of the neocons are such ""cry babies"" that anyone who undermines their nonsense is removed from Face Book and other Internet connections.One example of the war party's deceit is John Yoo who tried to cite Alexander Hamilton's views in THE FEDERALIST PAPERS. Supposedly Hamilton said the US presidents had the same power as King George III. Yoo blundered in that he DID NOT finish the citation whereby Hamilton argued that presidents' war making powers were limited by the US Constitution and a declaration of war by Congress. Yoo had to retreat.The undersigned disagreed with Woods' economic views. Woods economic views were logical and expressed very well. However, his views would work in ""a perfect world."" The political greed and corruption is so entrenched that Woods' views would not work. On the other hand, Woods's economic arguments are well worth reading to understand what is wrong.In spite of minor disagreements, Woods' book titled REAL DISSENT is an ""eye opener. This writer recommends any of Woods books which anyone of ""residual common sense"" can enjoy reading and comprehend. Hopefully Woods will write more thoughtful books and monographs if only for the record.James E.

"A previous reviewer remarked that George Seldes' (1890-1995) book titled THE GREAT QUOTATIONS  is the only book of quotations that is necessary, and the reviewer is right. Seldes' book is thorough, clear, and comprehensive. Seldes was one of the very rare journalists who was knowledgeable about history including Ancient History, Medieval History, Modern History (US and EUROPEAN HISTORY). Seldes was one of the few journalists who wrote where apprehensively conventional historians and journalists were too afraid to go.Charles Austin Beard once wrote that anyone who repeated The Bill of Rights would be branded as a ""red,"" and dangerous. Members of the US Congress refused to go record in quoting the Bill of Rights and the written of Thomas Jefferson-so much for being un-American. In other words the written expression of the ""Founding Fathers"" was too dangerous for ignoramuses. What was worse for the cowardly was Seldes' examination of fabricated quotes,  Seldes also did a good job of locating original quotes and the fact the ""apprehensively conventional"" cowards altered the quotes to fit their political agenda. Seldes was well aware of how power destroys liberty, and, to paraphrase Bakunin (1814-1876), liberty destroys power. Or, As the state expands, liberty declines. As Seldes knew very well. most famous political leaders  have been liars, hypocrites, and cowards. As Pierre de Beaumarchais (1732-1799) wrote, ""Be commonplace and creeping, and you be a success."" Or, as Max Beerbohm (1872-1956) wrote ""The  Nonconformist makes cowards of us all.""Seldes cited scathing denunciations of war. For example, Erasmus (1466-1536 wrote that war is delightful to those who have had no experience. Seldes often wrote about cowardly war mongers, war wimps, and chicken hawks. Seldes cited a phrase that those who are the most patriotic for war are those who get the profits from war. Readers should read the book titled MERCHANTS OF DEATH.to get a good look at the hypocrisy. Even Henry Ford (1863-1947) remarked that,"" We must get our boys out of the trenches by Christmas."" In other words, men can be rationale when they view war from a distance. As an aside, Nietzche (1844-1900) once wrote that bad music sound good when war is in the air.Seldes was well informed re labor movements and reform. He mentioned Mellon's remark that one cannot run a coal mine without machine guns. Another great quote was ""A plowman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees."" Seldes knew very well that wealth can be a servant or a master. Or, men do not master wealth so much as wealth masters men-at the expense of the poor.poor. Seldes noticed that the habits and conditions of the destitute were often made by by the well housed, war, and well fed.As readers may know know, Seldes was critical of ""organized religion,"" or organized hypocrisy. Women, the carriers of the race, have been treated contemptuous and degrading. Seldes cited numerous quotes of the cruelty imposed by religious fanatics. Harold E. Stassen once wrote,""whoever kindles the flames of intolerance in american is lighting a fire underneath his own home. Seldes showed considerable knowledge of the religious wars and the useless tragic bloodshed of these wars.Seldes' book titled THE GREAT QUOTATIONS is thorough and well written. He arranged the quotes alphabetically, and the undersigned thinks the organization of the book should have been my historical sequence. That however should not discourage reading this tome. Seldes did not let his ""leftist"" sympathies interfere with the honesty of book. As an aside, Seldes resulted in his deportation from the Soviet Union and Fascist Italy. Again, readers should know that Seldes was historically knowledgeable which is now rare among current journalists who know nothing more than five minutes again.James E.

"George Seldes (1890-1995) was a prolific writer and ""gadfly."" He did not flinch exposing hypocrisy and hate mongering. While some readers may consider Seldes as a ""leftist,"" whatever that term means, Seldes was honest. Seldes' book titled WITCH HUNT has ""a familiar ring"" given the stupidity and hypocrisy among the wing nut political figures.Rarely do journalists and media gurus get anything right. Seldes wrote that the ""experts"" had no understanding of Russian History or the Bolshevik Revolution. Seldes reported that journalists tried to grab headlines by contradictory stories in Russia. Seldes commented on contradictory reports that Lenin had Trotsky arrested and the revolution was on the verge of collapse-""famous last words."" What drew the ire of political leaders and corporate executives were the well researched reports of British and French CEOs  selling weapons and war material to the Germans during WW I. A solid book which gave ""chapter and verse"" of such transactions was titled MERCHANTS OF DEATH which French, British, and even US authorities tried to suppress.Seldes then explained conditions of post WW I Germany. Fears erupted of a Communist revolution which had a short life. German business executives were making huge profits and live well while the German people suffered from food shortages and illness because of the illegal blockade of Germany AFTER WW I was over. Basically, the red baiting had a temporary problem as political leaders wanted to punish the Germans and at the same time viewed the Germans as a bulwark against Big Communism. The hypocrites were so unaware that they did not see the glaring contradiction.While the British and French looted the Germans after WW I, the German industrialist Stinnes looted the Belgium people during WW I. Seldes made a pertinent remark that no one cared when the most defenseless were looted and forced into terrible living conditions regardless no which ""side"" they happened to reside. What was amusing was the fact that one of the loudest hypocrites against ""The Red Menace"" was doing a lucrative business with Soviets (Lenin, Stalin, & co). Of course any public mention was suppressed by press barons and political officials.While hate mongering got a lot of mileage, exposures of such nonsense did occur. Robert La Follette (1895-1953), who succeeded his father as US Senator, exposed the hate mongers and red baiters. The problem the press managers gave these hearing little or no pages, and only diligent  research gave the hearings any attention. The red baiters were confounded and them almost silent during these hearings. Basically Seldes emphasized that ad hominem slurs especially the term ""red"" threw all reason and knowledge into the ""Orwellian Memory Hole.""H. L. Mencken once wrote that ""....the true patriot expects to be well paid..."" The bribes paid to smaller circulation news editors made them ""God's fools."" However some of these bribes cause trouble for those involved J. B. Sherican who tried to smear those who favored public utilities over private utilities was so involved that he committed suicide. The government investigations into his nefarious activities were never reported in the press.Not only did red baiting attack political and economic dissenters, the red baiting affected social legal policy. A Mrs. Eaton lost custody of her two children because she attended lectures at the Rand School in New York City. She was questioned about her religious beliefs, scientific views, and her political reading. All that had to be mentioned was the Rand School was communist, which it was not, and based on she lost a custody. As an aside, due process forbids mention of a witness' religion, ancestry, or political affiliation.Two sections of the book are titled ""Just Around the Corner"" and ""Small Town Fascism."" These sections gave a detailed explanation of how small town news editors incited violence which was followed by local gangs of cowardly thugs. Laura Law of the state of Washington was murdered because she was a dissenter. Local prosecutors refused to prosecute premeditated murder, and police officials protected these cowards. As Seldes noted, calling someone a red was a good enough reason to murder that someone.Seldes further noticed that sensible people became hate mongers against Jews, communists, etc.-if the money was right. Conceding to bribes and wealth made otherwise decent people vulnerable to losing ALL of their self respect. Even those whose ancestors were victimized now became the inquisitors against other innocent victims. Al Capone engaged in red baiting forgetting that Italian immigrants faced discrimination and persecution. Father Coughlin became an inquisitor in spite of the hatred directed toward Irish Catholic during the 19th. and early 20th. centuries. Hypocrites forget history and have short memories.One might ask why such hate mongering is allowed. The answer is willful ignorance and the fact that too many people now see stupidity and violence as virtues. Seldes' book is a reminder how stupid some people are and that cowards and hypocrites are willing to destroy anyone so these cowards can get undeserved attention and bribes at any cost-to their victims. The undersigned recommends any of Seldes' books.James E.

"Max Nomad (1881-1973) wrote a comprehensive book titled POLITICAL HERETICS about political theory and misguided actions based on often faulty theory. Nomad surveyed he limited political thinking during the time of the Ancient Greeks and Romans and quickly transitions his book to the political thinking during Early and Late Modern History. Those studying ""political science"" would do well to read and digest this tome.In re the Ancient Romans, the Gracchi brothers who tried to make reforms were assassinated ten years apart. The fact that the Roman elites were threatened by suggested reforms between 133-102 BC led to popular dictators and eventually emperors who far exceeded the power of the Roman Senate. The political views of Plato (c.428-347) were based on elites or Aristocracy whom many Greeks accepted. as long as their political and economic benefits were satisfied.Nomad made a quick transition to modern European Historical political thought. Nomad's book was accurate re Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) thought. As noted in the book Bentham made a transition from ""Classical Liberalism"" to Socialism which reflected the working conditions of ""blue collar"" workers. Another British political write was William Godwin (1756-1836) who scathingly condemned Britain's class society. Although was considered as a pariah and criminal. However, William Pitt the Younger (1759-1806) admitted Godwin was right in private conversation.Nomad had good sections on the French ""radicals."" During the violent turmoil of the French Revolution, the Reign of Terror, the Thermodorian  response, and the rise and fall of the French Empire, Nomad explained the conspiracies and intrigue the ""revolutionaries"" used against each other. No wonder historians used the expression, ""The French Revolution swallowed its children."" One of the casualties was Babeuf who led The Conspiracy of Equals was put to death after the rise of the Reign of Terror. The ""practical"" men of politics had to get rid  of Babeuf. Another French political ""heretic"" was Blanqui (105-1881) who repeatedly survived arrests and imprisonment. His organization titled League of the Just showed ""lasting power"" until late in the 19th. century. In re ""political infighting, Lamartine (1790-1869) was at first pleased with working class help in deposing the French monarch Louis Philippe (1830-1848), but he was terrified by the workers when they made demands which resulted in the June Days Revolution (1848) which was crushed.While the French had a tradition of revolution, the Germans had their fair share of ""Political Heretics."" Aside from Marx (1818-1883), other Germans proposed suggestions for socialism. The big argument was the debate between those who proposed violent revolution and the ""revisionists"" who wanted gradual legal changes leading to socialism. Some of the German socialists included Kautsky (1854-1938), La Salle (1825-1864) and Edward Bernstein (1850-1932) who drove the fanatics crazy. The Revisionists were right when they argued that German workers were more concerned about better pay, better working conditions, and social security/health benefits. The fanatics and Revisionists were blunted by the ""conservative"" German Chancellor Bismarck (1815-1899) who ""stole the socialist thunder.""The British heretics had the same problem the German socialists had. The British Socialists, Communists, and etal., competed with the British trade union leaders. ""The name of the game"" was who could deliver what the British working class wanted. What Nomad could have focused upon was the rise of The British Union of Fascists under the leadership of Oswal Mosley (1896-1980) whose support was based on Britain's disillusionment over World War I and the Great Depression.Nomad did a credible job in discussing Anarchism which is a more ""modern"" political phenomenon in Western History. Nomad discussed Proudhon (1809-1865)who suggested a ""People's Bank"" and local political and economic arrangements. Nomad's treatment of Bakunin (1814-1876) was interesting. Bakunin's work which was popular in Russian, Spain, and Italy, included a concept of anarchist dictatorship. Kropotkin (1842-1921) had more ""practical solutions such as federations of diverse skilled people who would be free of Russian Czars and serfdom. Kropotkin wrote, among other works, two books titled FIELDS, FACTORIES, AND WORK SHOPS and MEMOIRS OF A REVOLUTIONARY. These books provide careful thinking.The US had their own political heretics some of whom had to be imported. Emma Goldman (1869-1940), who was deported under trivial circumstances, wrote THE ABCS OF ANARCHISM, LIVING MY LIFE, and MY DISSOLUTION IN RUSSIA wrote well and informed readers of anarchism. Alexander Berkman (1870-1936), who wounded Henry Clay Frick (1849-1919) and spent fourteen years in prison, authored books re anarchism. Victor Berger (1860-1929) started the International Workers of the World.The better known heretics were Lenin (1870-1924) and Stalin (1879-1953) had to abuse language re Marx's definition of a classless society. What began as a phrase everything according to his abilities and everything according to his needs had to converted to everything according one's ability.The Soviet Union had a very strict class society except in name. As readers should note many millions of Russian were starved to support industrial workers and especially managers and technicians. ""The Workers' Paradise"" became a nightmare, and Lenin and Stalin in effect terrible mass murderers via lethal policies and a through police state.Nomad's book also updated the Chinese Communists and Mao Tse-tung (1893-1976) used political divisions and purges a la Lenin and Stalin. His ""Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom"" was a trap to expose dissidents and those who opposed Mao's Communist Party. Mao knew who to galvanize the Chinese via The Great Leap Forward which was an economic fiasco. Mao's Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s was actually a savage political  purge. While the Soviet and Chinese Communists had bitter disputes, their methods of trapping their internal dissidents were similar.Max Nomad's book POLITICAL HERETICS is a good book that gives ""novices"" a good background on political thought from Ancient History through much of the 20th. century. Nomad was surprisingly thorough, and he mentioned many political thinkers whom historians have neglected. Nomad wrote very well, and his book is readable. Those who know history and the ""uninitiated"" will benefit from Nomad's book title POLITICAL HERETICS.James E.

"Mohammad Rehman's  book titled ANGELS ARE CRYING is a book that is long overdue. Rehman's book provided vivid contrast between what Mohammad the Prophet taught and wrote in the QURAN and the corruption of Islam since Mohammad's last sermon in 632. Rehman's corrects the misconceptions that many Muslims now believe, and he provided Westerners with a more accurate view of Islam.Contrary to modern Islamic rulers, Rehman wrote about the QURAN's insistence on charity. The book explains The Five Pillars of Islam which are a belief in God, donate to Charity/help the poor, pray five times a day facing Mecca, fast during the daylight hours during Ramadan, and, if possible, make one pilgrimage to Mecca  Contrary to current fanatic views toward women, Mohammed the Prophet insisted on respect for woman, and Mohammad dearly loved his wife Bibi. Mohammad considered his daughter Fatima the second most important woman in history next to the Virgin Mary.Those Westerners who preach hatred toward Muslims would do well to read this book. Mohammad and his early followers highly praised biblical people. Early Muslims accepted the Jewish Torah and much of the New Testament. Mohammad & co. highly praised Christ and the view of Christ's resurrection. Similar to Catholicism, Muslims accept the Perpetual Virginity of Saint  Marry. Mohammad referred to Jews and Christians as ""People of the Book. Rehman was clear that Mohammad and early Muslims permitted and even welcome Jews and Christians into to city of Mecca which, by contrast, is only open to Muslims.When some Westerners complain about the Sharia laws, Rehman cited sections of the QURAN that are in contrast to these restrictive laws. As Rehman noted, the Shariat laws were compiled in 749 AD almost 117 years after the death of Mohammad. Rehma reminded readers that these laws both contradicted both actual meaning of the QUARAN and the spirit of early Islam. The QUARAN and early Islam accepted the view that Jews and Catholics along with devout Muslims had a place in the afterlife. As Rehman noted, Mohammad & co. were more concerned about deeds and actions than sectarian differences. The QURAN also severely condemned fanatical violence.Contrary to current misconceptions, original Islam encouraged compassion and forgiveness. Rehman mentioned that forgiveness was important and those who needed mercy had to be serious about reconciliation of wrong doing. Some critics of Islam complain about the fact that early Moslems could have four wives. However, this provision was due to out of a sense of justice rather than lust. Husbands were often lost to war, and woman were economically and socially vulnerable. Readers must remember that Old Testament figures had several wives and mistresses.Rehman also had interesting comments re ""Great"" men. While Alexander the Great, the Roman emperors, Genghis and Kublai Khan were considered great, Mohammad argued that mass slaughter is a terrible sin and crime. Rehman mentioned this to undermine the war/militant impulse of fanatics who consider themselves Muslims.Rehman also gave contemporary examples of the corruption of the QUARAN and early Islam. Islamic leaders from the Middle East, Western Asia, the Orient, and Africa has used corruption and violence to enhance personal wealth. Rehman cited ""chapter and verse"" of Islamic rulers hypocrisy and violence in violation of the QURAN. Islamic authorities condemn vices but foster gambling, excessive drinking, prostitution, child slavery, and unjust oppression. The lavish life style of these rulers is contrasted by the simple live and residence of Mohammad who urged simply living and charity. Western intervention in these areas and support for corrupt officials has made tense situations far worse. Hate mongers have fed into anti-Islamic bias simply which has incited both unaware Westerners and Islamic fanatics.Mohammed Rehman wrote a great book. This reviewer's only minor criticism is that the book should have an index. The writing is clear. The book is informative and well done. Muslims and non-Muslims would have a much better understanding of the QURAN and the actual meaning of Islam. Hopefully this book will have a wide readership.James E.

"Father Daniel Berrigan (1921-present) wrote a collection of poetry that was embellished by Adrianna Amari's photos. Howard Zinn's introcution to the book gives readers ""a taste"" of what is expected. Zinn commented to burning draft records and pouring blood on such records was not a tragedy, but using napalm and spilling innocent blood is tragic.The ""message"" of the selection of poems is that life and death are part of continuous process. Berrigan was clear that life and precious and that death is not end. Death can produce a meaningful legacy, and memories left after death can continue one's legacy-good or bad. Contrary to a commercial world and hate mongering, some people and incidents can inspire if people ever take the time to think what is actually important tather than ""cheap grace. The ""soul"" is like the wind which cannot be seen but can be experience. Serious men and woman can appreciate ""The Body of Christ"" without a comprehensive understanding. Those ""holier-than-thou"" know-it-alls who think they have ""all the answers,"" are trapped by the fact that a God who can be described scientifically and technologically  is in fact no God. Some concepts can be appreciated while remaining a mystery.Berrigan amusingly described someone who had no money, no fear, no lies but had a soul and a conscience as ""Un-American"" what ever that now means. Love and compassion are concepts that far exceed material possessions. Even lost loved ones can still exist via fond memories and their legacy. What is life without friends and loved ones. Such a life is full as material possessions can make life dull, lonely and absolutely meaningless. Men and women should celebrate the sublime relations which exceed the false hopes via advertising.One of the themes of Berrigan's poetry is time. Convictions, changes, renewal, and love take time. Maturity and becoming better people take time. Time can be an ally or an enemy depending on how people spend their lives .Berrigan's  message is the people can waste time or take advantage of time to become better people.Another poem in this collection dealt with the bloody 20th. and 21st. century. However the innocents who have died still leave a lesson about the uselessness of ""Man's Inhumanity to Man."" While the names and identifications of those innocent people who lied, their martyrdom can be remembered of people come to their senses. How people die is important. Many live meaningless lives while others whose self sacrifice and acts of mercy give their lives meaning while giving meaning to those who benefit or at least obse4rve.The last poem is a memorial to all the innocent who have died from W.W. II to the present. One might hope that such history may one day resonate and make people more loving, charitable, and thought. Berrigan provided so many examples in the last poem that contemporaries should invesitage who tragic these events were if only to learn from past evils.Berrigan's book is a direct assault on thoughtless conformity. The introduction and the poems focus on the appreciation of life and using memories to enhance our own lives. The lessons contained herein are important contrasted with dull monotony of stupid advertising and mindless cowardly political rhetoric. Since today is Food Friday, today may a good day to read Berrigan's work reflect on what he wrote.Good Friday, 2015James E.

"Pricilla Robertson wrote a well researched book about the 1848 Revolutions which rocked Europe for a year but had far-reaching consequences. Her book diagnosed the problems and the class divisions and hatreds that were simmering since the French Revolution. Miss Robertson also developed the theme of nationalist and ethic hatreds that were probably unknown a hundred years earlier. The revolutions were omen of the tragic events of the 20th century.Miss Robertson's began with events in France. The French who ousted Charles (1824-1830) replaced him with Louis Philippe (1830-1848) whose popularity waned in lieu of economic depression. When French wealthy middle classes had a protest banquet in 1848, someone ordered the troops standing guard to fire into the crowd, and ""all hell broke loose."" Miss Robertson related that the euphoria of revolution when the middle class realized that they should fear the working classes. Larmartine (1790-1869) learned to fear the proletariat. The issue as Robertson noted was the creation of the National Workshops which were created to alleviate unemployment. Louis Blanc (1811-1882) who supported these programs was frustrated when the middle class and agricultural workers decided to refuse to pay taxes for what they saw as idle workmen in Paris. The result was the June Days Revolt in 1848 which was crushed  and paved the way for Napoleon III (1852-1870) to seize power.Other Europeans experience revolutions. The Prussians faced turmoil during the reign of Frederick William IV (1840-`1862)who faced ""liberal"" rebellion when wealthy Prussian middle class representatives created the Frankfort Assemble. Frederick refused to accept ""a crown from the gutter"" when offered a revised position as constitutional monarch. Similar to events in France, the French middle classes also faced rebellions from the working classes and called upon Frederick to use the Prussian army to crush working class riots. Frederick then used the army and disband the Frankfort Assembly and saved his political situation.Revolution and rebellion part of the political landscape in Eastern Europe. Metternich (1770-1859) who was such an important figure in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire and to flee for his life. Franz Joseph (1848-1916) inherited a volatile situation both in Austria and Hungary. His problems extended to Italy where Italian unification had been a dream at least since 1831 if not earlier. Robertson observed that the only thing that saved the Hapsburgs was the Austrian army. Even then the Austrian troops could stop the rebellions in Hungary led by Louis Kossuth 1802-1894). Given the ""conservative"" nature of Czar Nicholas II (1825-1855), he sent Russians troops into Hungary to finish the Hungarian rebellion.While none of the 1848 revolutions were successful, they did not result in some reforms especially in  Austria-Hungary. The evolutions also showed the cities and urbane areas were increasingly important both economically and politically. These revolutions revealed the potential for bitter class conflict. The ""nationalities question"" showed that different ethnic groups could rebel only to turn on each in at attempt at ""ethnic cleansing. In other words, the 1848 revolutions were omens of what happened during the 20th century.Miss Robertson's book is well researched and well written. While the history of the 1848 revolutions is complex, Miss Robertson clarifies the issues and events to provide a clearer understanding of these revolutions. Even those readers who are not well read in history can easily comprehend the book and its implications.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIIKQGE5BZB7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00072IFM6#wasThisHelpful","RIIKQGE5BZB7A","A3JNCOY4A3MJUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JNCOY4A3MJUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Etienne Gilson (1884-1978) wrote a good summary about philosophy/theology, and Ultimate Being. Gilson presented problems posed by the Ancient Greeks and modern philosophers. While Gilson was a devout Catholic, he ""gave credit where credit was due."" He also effectively answered challenges to Catholic teaching. Jaroslav Pelikan (1923-2006) wrote a useful Forward to Gilson's book titled GOD AND PHILOSOPHY.Gilson started this book by explaining the insights of Ancient Greek philosophers. For example, Thales of Miletus (c.623-c.546 BC) argued that water had divine qualities and contained deities or that water was possibly a god. However, Thales never reached a clear point of origin. As Gilson noted, the Judeo-Christian view had an a priori view as ""I AM WHO I AM"" (Exodus 6:2). Plato (428-347 BC) viewed the celestial bodies as gods, but he also argued that the IDEA or ideas were above the gods. Aristotle (384-322 BC) made reference to a Supreme Being, but he held the gods ""at arms length.""Gilson treated modern philosophy with careful attention. He criticized Descartes (1506-1650) for trying to prove for what was obvious, namely physical reality. Descartes was too self absorbed to  allow other a priori causes. Gilson wrote St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) had already answered Descartes questions of a starting point.Gilson further assessed the thinking of Kant (1720-1804) and Compte The views of Kant and Compte relied too much on physical science . Gilson thought that Ultimate Reality or God was avoided and the metaphysics were just as much a part of reality as physical science. In other words men and women were more than just ""technocrats."" Metaphysics and abstract thought helped people become human and humane and not members of an insect colony.Gilson wrote a good explanation of Neo-Scholastic thought vs. contending and often conflicting thinking. Yet, as noted above, Gilson gave credit when necessary, and his book is not only a good introduction to Catholic philosophy/theology, but his book is helpful to understand ""other schools of thought.""James E.

"George Seldes (1890-1995) was a knowledgeable, tough journalist. His book titled  TELL THE TRUTH AND RUN is a history of  honesty vs. ""The Truth Telling Squads."" Seldes was too honest for the ""apprenhensively conventintal"" which obviously led to confrontation  and, at times, dangerous situations. Seldes' book is readable and invites readers to continue reading.Seldes began his journalistic career as a reporter for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania newspapers. His first experience with censorship dealt with is report of a traffic accident involving a driver of  a beer truck and a conveyance. When his report appeared in print, it was altered. The name of the beer company was omitted and facts were distorted. Seldes did an expose re police and ""red light districts"" only to be told  powerful real estate tycoons made money from these districts. The expose also included some police officers which was another reason for censoring and eliminating news reports.Another anecdote reported by Seldes was the Andrew Melon divorce trial which was held in secret. The Pennsylvania legislature passed a law to keep the proceedings secret, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania wire services including Western Union refused to send any reports. However, as Seldes noted, phone calls and mail could not be controlled and the events were reported to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Europe. Later the law re the Mellon's divorce was rescinded.Seldes' career expanded when he went to Europe toward the end of WW I.Seldes was critisized for telling the truth about a battle that never happened. Seldes got an interview with the German commander von Hindenberg (1837-1934) which was revealing. Von Hindenburg reported that the addition of US forces and infantry turned the tide against the Germans. This interview was censored and never reported at the time. In fact, the paronoid French authorities tried to have Seldes court-martialied and shot, but the effort failed. Seldes made a good arguement that had the interview been published, Hitler's rise to power may have been muted. Von Hindenburg was a German hero, and his word was respected. Had this interview been reported, Hitler's claim of the Germans being ""stabbed in the back"" by Communists, Socialists, and Jews would have been rebutted by the von Hindenburg interview.While Seldes was a ""leftist' (whatever that means)he was not a Communist. In spite of Seldes political sympathies, his desire was for the truth. When Seldes went to Bolshevik Russia c. 1922, Seldes wrote honestly about the terrible conditions in ""The Worker's Paradise."" When Seldes tried to sneak his reports out of the Bolshevik Russia, he was forced to leave. Just before Seldes left Bolshevik Russia, he asked a former Czarist officer in Trotsky's Red Army why he was in the service of the Bolsheviks. The officer answered that he was Russian first. This comment reminded the undersigned of a comment of a White commander who opposed the Reds and was  questioned when fighting erupted between White troops and American forces during the Russian Civil War between the Whites and the Reds. The White commander was told by a US journalist that the Bolsheviks were bastards. The White commander agreed, but said the Bolshviks ""were our bastards.""Seldes reported two interesting anecdotes while he was in Bolshevik Russia. He attended a speech by Lenin (1870-1024). Lenin's photographs as a big man and great orator were mitigated by Seldes' description of Lenin as a small man and dull orator. One credit that Seldes gave Lenin is that Lenin was the only important poltical leader that Seldes met who had a sense of humor.The only speaker whom Seldes respected while in Russia was Karl Radak (1885-1939).Upon Seldes' removal from Bolshevik Russia, he went to report on Mussolini (1883-1945) and Fascist Italy. Seldes reported on Mussolini's armed Black Shirts and embarrassed some wealthy Americans who financed the Italian dictator. Seldes was so disliked while in Fascist Italy, that he was forced to leave. His experience was the basis of Seldes's book re Musslini titled SAWDUST CEASAR.Seldes was then assigned to Spain to report on the Civl War between Franco's forces and the Loyalists. Seldes' report was similar to George Orwell's (1903-1950)book titled HOMAGE TO CATALONIA. Similar to Orwell's account Seldes critisized Communist intervention in this strife. As Seldes wrote, the Orwell book titled HOMAGE TO CATALONIA was finished in 1938 but was almost unheard of until about 1952 or 1953.Seldes was also in Toto's Yugoslavia and interviewed Tito. Tito was clear that he stopped Stalin's Soviet agents from taking control of Yugoslavia, and Tito's police and troops stuffed Stalin's attempt to turn Yugoslavia into a Soviet colony. Tito was vilified in the Soviet press, and Seldes was later accused of being a Communist and a ""red"" for this honest interview.Seldes certainly did not lead a dull life. As mentioned above, was a self admitted leftist, but he was honest regardless of polticial affiliations. When Seldes was accused of ""being one sided,"" the response was that Seldes reported the side that was omitted or distorted. Seldes' book is well written informative. Readers can learn much form this book.James E.

"Thus far, the undersigiged has not been disappointed by Father Baron's books, and  this book is no exception. Father Baron's book titled EUCAHARIST is an intelligent and readable account of the Cathoic concept of the Eucharist. His book offers a good explanation of the Eucharist to both Catholics and non-Catholics. If some readers do not accept the Eucharistic concepts, they at least know the resoning for this Catholic Sacrament.The  book began with a story titled ""Babette's Feast"" the setting of which was in Norway among straight lace Lutherans ( this is not a slur against Lutherans) who thought that enjoyment of good food was somehow wrong. Babette spends all of her money she won in the French lottery to prepare a sumptuous feast which her friends attend. The moral of the story was that Babette sacrificed all she had to prepare a feast which her stern guests enjoyed and forget about past differences. Father Baron compared with this the Last Supper which he argued brought forgiveness and renewal to the human race.Father Baron then ventures into Old Testament stories re sacrifice. He used the example of Abraham ordered by God to sacrifice his son until a lamb appears to replace the human sacrifice. Hence, Christ is often referred to as The Lamb of God or the Ultimate Sacrifice. As Father Baron reminded readers The Last Supper was the Passover, and Baron draws imagery and comparisons which help explain the Catholic concept of the Eucharist.Father Baron's book dealt with the Gospel of John 6:53-63. In the discourse with His followers, Christ defines Himself as flesh and blood which must be consumed. Christ's does not retreat from his remarks which caused many followers to leave because the teaching was ""too hard."" Perhaps they should have waited for ""the punch line"" in John 6:63 whereby Christ said ""It is the Spirit who gives life."" Christ's comments are again reflected in the Last Supper narratives.Father Baron concludes his book with a comment by Flannery O'Connor (1924-1965)who was told that the Eucharist was ""a powerful symbol."" Flannery O'Conner said that if the Eucharist was just a symbol,""... the hell with it."" In other words the Eucharist is essential and crucial to devout Catholics. Father Baron made another interesing comment re the wine and hosts. The soil, the sun and other aspects of the Cosmos go into the preparation of the wine and bread. Since these elements part of God's Creation, Christ's spiritual Real Presence is present. St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)once wrote that the accidents of bread and wine appear as such, but the Essence of the bread and wine become of the essence of Christ.Father Baron could have enhanced this book by reporting on the intense arguement between Peter Abelard (1043-1142) and St. Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153). Both men accepted the Real Presence of Christ, but Benard thought that Abelard's dialetical examination of the Holy Trinity would trivialize the Sacred Mysteries. As an aside, both men recondiled, and Abelard died in full communion with the Catholic Church in a Cistertian monastery founded by Bernard.Father Baron does not engage in acrimony. He wrote an intelligent commentary about the Eucharist and the reasons for this Sacrament. Again, regardless of religious affiliation, readers can learn from this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ANYUO496BQR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1570757224#wasThisHelpful","R3ANYUO496BQR1","A3JNCOY4A3MJUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JNCOY4A3MJUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"H. W. Crocker III wrote a good survey of Catholic Church.  Croker's book is well written and well organized. Crocker also showed wit and the book is laced with humor which keeps readers' attention. The book is a good introduction to approximately 2000 years of Catholic History and should invite further investigation..The Prologue treated Constantine's military  victory over Maxentius at Milvian Bridge in 312 AD. Crocker's description of the battle scene was suprisingly well done. If Crocker is not a military historia, he still did an exceptional job. The victory insured freedom of religious liberty for both Catholics and ""Pagans.""Crocker's account of Roman control of Judea  c. 63 BC provided a historiical background to  Jewish background and political history from which early Catholicism emerged. Crocker explained the differences among Jewish groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes,etc. Readers should note that St. Paul was at one time a persecuting Pharissee.Crocker then examined the persecution of the Early Church. Persecutions were mostly sporadic, but the reigns of Decius (249-252)and Diocletian (284-305)consisted of attempts to erase the Early Church. When one reads that the Early Church was built on the blood of its martyrs, these persecutions confirm that phrase. The Early Church faced internal problems from the Gnostics, the Arians, and others. The Council of Nicea (325) resolved these differences in favor of St. Athanasius (293-373)who argued in favor of both Christ's human and divine nature (The Nicene Creed and the Apostles'Creed).Challenges to the early Catholic Church did not stop. The Roman civil wars and pressures from ""barbarians"" occured while St. Jerome (346-420)edited and translated the Vulgate Bible, and St. Augustine (354-430) wrote his classics such as THE CITY OF GOD. The Popes did what they could to maintain Catholcism in spite of barbarian invasions and fickle poltical leaders. The reputation of the Papacy and the early Catholic Church was enhanced when Pope Leo I (440-461)successfully negotiated an agreement with Atilla the Hun (400-453)not to sack Rome which later resulted in Hun defeats and the collapse of the Hun threat.The Catholic Church also benefited from barbarian realms which were created out of the Roman Empire. From c. 500-750,barbarian leaders needed literate people to administer new found kingdoms. Since the only literate men were Catholic clergy, monks, and nuns, these Catholics were valued for their literacy. Clovis (c.480-520) gave the Benedictines land and recognition due to their learning and ability. St. Benedict (480-544)created this order whose monks created the library at Monte Casino. Pope Gregory I (590-604)encouraged learning and is credited for creating Gregorian Chant. Crocker explained that the Catholic authorities were enhanced by Charles Martel's (718-774)victory over supposedly invincible Moslems in 732. His later successor Charlemagne (768-814)was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III (795-816)to benefit of both Charlegmange's Franks and the Catholic Church.Unfortunately, after Charlemagnes'death, the Europeans were invaded by Saracens (Noth African Moslems)Magyars (Hungarians), and especially the Scandanavians. The Papacy suffered creditibility due to simony, bribes, and nepotism. Crocker ""did not shy away"" from the Church scandals and carefully explained these problems. Secular rulers tried to take control of the Catholic Church, and the scandals gave cause for secular ""reform."" The installation of Pope Gregory VII (1073-1085)brought reform and what some historians call The Papal Revolution. Gregory's reforms led to conflict with the German ruler Henry IV (1056-1106) which led to excommunication, reconciliation, and war. While Henry's were forced to leave Italy by the Normans, the Normans looted Rome when they were not paid. Gregory did not live long enough to realize his Papal Revolution whereby the Pope and the Curia gradually wrested control of the Catholic ChurchAnother crisis emerged re the Crusades. When Pope Urban (1088-1099)called for the Crusades in 1095, European History changed radically. The initial success of the Crusaders was marred by later political and economic power struggles. In 1204, the Crusaders looted Constantinople in revenge for Byzantine savage attacks on Catholics previously. The Crusades were ultimately a military failure, but they helped Europeans learn from their enemies. The crudading spirit also affected Western Europe. In 1208, French Catholics defeated a much large army of Algigensians who threatened the social order and stability in Europe. The Albigensian threat was based on their fanaticism and casual toleration of murder.To meet the threat of the Albigensians, St. Dominic (1170-1221) started a new order called The Order of Preachers or Dominicans who were a studious order who used reason and effective preaching to combat heresy. Crocker gave credit to St. Dominic,St. Albertus Magnus (1193-1280), and especially St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)who re-emphasized Aristotle's work on logic to make the Catholic Faith reasonable to counter ""blind faith,"" supersitition, and fanaticism. Crocker's coverage of St. Thomas Aquinas & co. was short but surprisingly well done.In spite of the progress of the ""High Middle Ages"" (c.1050-1350),the Catholic Church had further divisions and almost complete disaster. Crocker wrote a good account of the Catholic Church's Schism (1377-1414)wherby a dispute between Phillip IV (1285-1314)and Pope Boniface VIII (1294-1303) led to rival claims to Papacy, persecution, and finally reconciliation at the Council of Constance (1414-1417). However these conflicts weakened the Church and assited the ""Reformation."" Beginning with the political support of Luther (1483-1546)and the division of Europe, Europe was convulsed in violent religious hatred, terrible religious wars including the terrible Thirty Years War (1618-1648), and attacks on science. As some historians noted, the Europeans entered a new age of barbarism.Yet, the Catholic Counter Reformation was spectacular. The Catholics regained areas of Poland from the Protestants. New effective Catholic orders were created, and the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits, were the most notable. St. Ignatius of Loyala (1491-1556)started the Jesuits, and their fame of learning became well know. As St. Ignatius once wrote,""Virtue unlearned is virtue  unarmed."" Catholics regained self confidence, and the expansion became permanent.Crocker devoted a section to refute false claims about Catholics denying science. Father Copernicus (1473-1573)developed a heliocentric solar system which Catholic authorities promoted. The false canard that Galleo was jailed and tortured was refuted by Crocker. Galileo was never imprisosned and never tortured. His biggest fault was that he was an ungrateful guest. In 1610, Pope Paul V (1605-1621)had a large reception honoring Galileo. Later in 1624 Pope Urban VIII (1622-1644)who ""persecuted"" Galileo, honored Galileo with another huge reception. Galileo insulted his hosts and made claims which could not be proven at the time. Galileo was given a house arrest in 1633 which was a moot point since he was legally blind. While under arrest, Galileo resides in luxurious living quarters with his own chef and wine taster. While he was told not to write, he did, and his daughter a devout nun, did his written expression. Some of Galileo's best work re physics was done in his later life.Crocker spent considerable time writing about the convulsions started by the French Revolution. Crocker gave ""chapter and verse"" details about the convulsions of the French Reign of Terror, wars of the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, and the persecution of Catholics plus Catholic martyrs. With the aftermath of French Revolution and the rise of Nationalism, the Papacy lost control of the Papal States. Yet, Catholic influence did not die with the loss of the Papal States. A Catholic started renewal of Thomism and successful response to Modernism enhanced the Catholic Church both socially and intellectually.Catholics were again challenged by the convulsions of the 20th. century. Crocker, among others, refuted the false claims that somehow Pope Pius XII was ""Hitler's Pope."" Crocker again cited ""chapter and verse"" with numerous sources as others have done. The Catholic authorities made intelligent responses to crises during and after the Cold War. Crocker summarized recent Catholic History very well.Crocker's book is well written and informative. While this writer disagrees with Crocker's political views, the undersigned cannot deny that Crocker wrote a good book that should be attractive to readers of whatever political persuasion. The book is a good start for those interested in Catholic history.January 11, 2015James E.

"Mabel Walker's book titled THE FENIAN MOVEMENT is a well researched book that is both tragic and ""a comedy of errors."" The background of the book was the Civil War and Reconstruction Era which explained the Fenians' hope of establishing an indenpednt Irish State in either Ireland or Canada. Walker gave detalied explanations of the eventual failure of the Fenian movement some of which were amusing.As noted, the background of the Fenian movement was the Civil War. As readers may know, the Northerners recruited many Irish to fill the ranks of the armies. While a Fenian spokesman claimed the number of Irish who were recruited was about 150,000 men, the actual number was ;probably just over 50,000 men which was still a considerable number. As an aside, both Confederate an Northern commanders gave these men credit for being brave and good soliders.Irish Catholics, and in fact most Catholics, faced hostility and attempts at persecution before and after the Civil War. As a result, the Irish formed socieites for cultural unity and defense against such bigotry. Among those who were hostile to Catholics were members of ""The Know Nothing Party."" In response to anti-Catholic bias in parts of North American and Great Britian, the Irish were imbued with Irish Nationalism. Since so many Irish were trained military personel, the Fenians thought these men could be organized into Irish brigades and create an Independent Irish Republic in Canada or Ireland which were both under British control.The Fenians were bitterly divided over leadership and the use of funds. Walker descripbed in great detail the accusations and counter accusations of theft of funds, betrayal, and leadership incompetence. Another issue was the question of creation of an Irish Republic in Canada or Ireland. Some of the Irish wanted a constutional, peaceful approach while the Fenians wanted an Irish armed revolution. These issues and accusations pre-occupied the Fenians during the 1860s until 1870. As Walker noted, the Fenians were devout Catholics. Pope Pius IX (1846-1878) condemned ""secret societies,"" and the Fenians were accused of being a secret society. The moral dilemma for the Fenians was to either remain a secret society or operate openly. The latter option left the Fenians open to exposure and victims of spies and informers.Another issue was the diplomatic problem between US and British authorities. The neutrality laws between US and British authorites caused tensions. The British accused US leaders of violations because of some limited support for the Fenians. US leaders accused the British leaders of violations re British de facto support for the Confederates during the Civil War and the release of Confederate naval raiders such as THE ALABAMA. The Fenians hoped that such tensions would lead to war and give the Fenians a chance to claim an Irish republic in the midst of such tensions. Unfortunately for the Fenians, ""cooler heads prevailed."" Walker carefully explained the problems that the US Secretary of War Stanton and Secretary of State Sewerd had in handling such delicate diplomacy. At times, the Irish vote in the US influenced decisions or least ""lip service"" in support of the Fenians. Walker did an excellent job explaining these problems.Due to informers and tepid US support plus Fenian distrust of the leaders, the Fenian movement was doomed to failure. A Fenian expedition into Canada in 1870 met with disaster. Rebellions in Ireland were ""stillborn"" because of British spies, and the Fenian movement lost support. Lack of effective unity and diplomatic issues doomed Fenian efforts both in Canada and the US. The British Prime Minister, Gladstone, made concessions to the Irish (in Ireland) by a land bill which gave the Irish hope for a constituional solution for indendence which armed force could not achieve.G.K. Chesterton (1874-1936) commented that some Catholic bashers said the Irish were priest driven. After 1923, the Irish disgourged themselves of British landlords and were no longer landlord driven. An Irish joke which may give insight to failure of the Fenians is an alleged remark by an Irish Catholic priest. He told the men in his congregation that they drank far too much which was why they beat their wives. He then said the strong drink incited them to shoot at British landlords and that strong drink was the reason they missed.Mabel Walker did a good job of informing readers of a neglected topic re history. Her reseach is meticulous, and her written expression is clear. Her research is a good case study of careful historical investigation to support her conclusions. Those interested in Irish History will enjoy this book.James E.

"Wendy Towle wrote a children's book that is informative and ""inspiring."" The book give a short precise of the life and achievements of Elijah McCoy (1844-1929)) who was a son of escaped slaves. Elijah's father, George McCoy distingushed himself via the Canadian  1837 Rebel War and was awarded a large amount of land for his service. Even though the Mccoys were escaped slaves they knew the value of learining and serious study.Elijah McCoy went to school in Colchester, Ontario where he studied hard and mastered literacy. McCoy's avid interest in mechnaics was enhanced when he was sent to Scotland to study physics and engineering when Elijah was only 16 years old. Elijah McCoy earned advanced degrees in engineering but could only get a ""menial"" job as a fireman/oilman for the Michigan Central Railroad Co. in Michigan.This job served Elijah McCoy well. He had to monitor the firebox and the water boiler which was dangerous. As Wendy Towle reported, Elijah McCoy lubricated wheel axles which was tedious work. He developed an advanced oil cup which automratically did the work.His invention was so good that other products were simply inferiour. Historians argue that the phrase ""The Real McCoy"" was due to MeCoy's surperior oil cup. He also invented the ironing board and better shoe soles.Wendy Towle reported  Elijah created other inventions which earned 55 patents.McCoy's second wife Mary McCoy was a dedicated wife and active in civid work and charities. In spite of the ""race issue,"" the McCoys were well respected. Elijah McCoy's genius was widely recogized.Wendy Towle mentioned that Elijah McCoy tried to encourage young people to study and focus on what is important. His example and advice are important especially when readers consider that he was the son of escaped slaves.Wendy Towle introduced readers to an inspiring story of someone who was not supposed to succeed. However, Wendy Towle showed readers that good parental encouragement and dedication to study and learn can lead to great achievement.

"Henrik Tikkanen's (1924-1984) anti-war novel titled THE THIRTY YEARS' WAR is a short but poignant portrayal of the stupdidty, hyprocricy, and tragedy of false patriotism and lack of reason when ""war is in the air."" Tikkanen was multilingual and was branded as a ""leftist""  whatever that means. He was knowledgeable and well informed. He also had a delightful sense  of humor which is demonstrated in this novel.The first page of the book is funny. Tikkanen teasingly contrasted Finnish sainsts as war heroes with Italian saints who were deeply religious. Since the Italian soldiers did not do well in modern war, the Italians relied on God while the Finns relied on their military commanders. Tikkanen probably knew that Italian troops were brave, but modern Italians were not industrialized enough for modern war.Tikkanen proceded to explain the illogic of military officers. One of the characters named Hurmalainen was a brick layer who made the rank of sergeant. However, because, through no fault of his own, the sergeant was demoted to a private with loss of benefits. Since Hurmalainen was a brick layer, he figured with the destruction caused by war (The Finnish-Soviet War which started in late 1939 or 1940)that as brick layer he could find employment once the war stopped.Some of the people in Finland were alternatively under the control of either the Soviets or the Finns. These people were told that each side was fighting for these folks' ""freedom,"" but those who wished to left alone did not understand nor want either sides' ""freedom."" As an aside, does this sound familiar?The main character was named Viktor Kappara who was a private in the Finnish army who took abeying orders to extreme. Not realizing that W.W.II was over in 1945,he remained at his post for 30 years thinking that anyone who entered his ""combat"" zone were  either Soviet troops, Communist sympathizers, or Communist infiltrators. He NEVER got any orders to return home, and Viktor would not ever disobey ""official orders."" The thirty years he stayed at his post were amuisng and tragic. He murdered an unarmed man and woman who were innocent of any wrong doing. He murdered this couple in ""cold blood"" even though the woman was nude and taking a both. Viktor figured these folks who apparently had no business living in a remote area had to be Communist infiltrators. When Viktor learned that the West was engaged in the Korean War, he thought the Finns had overrun the Soviet Union and were fighting in Asia.Later when a sheriff's investigation into the murder of the above unarmed civilians, the scene turned almost comic. The sheriff was just a paranoic as Vikto, and many of the professionl anti-communists in the US. The sheriff realized that Viktor probably committed the murders and thought the Finnish soldier had killed this couple ""defending the homeland."" The sheriff spied on Viktor, and Tikkanen compared both men's ignorance and paranoia.Later the novel was more comical and tragic. When different Finnish bureaucrats realized the situation, they sent ""experts"" to Viktor's post to make a hero out of him for being so loyal defending Finland for so long. Each blundered, and some were killed. One of the favorite paraphrases was the Finns and Germans had to die so Finland and Germany could live. Or to use a stupid phrase during the Vietnam War, a village had to be destroyed so it could be saved.Toward the of the novel, Viktor could not understand the Orwellian view that former bitter enemies became allies and vice versa. Finnish arms manufacturers as well as those in the West were arming both ""allies"" and ""enemies"" who ""changed shirts and uniforms"" instantly.The last part of this novel, was dsiturbing yet humorous. Those who were sent to rescue Viktor were either shot or forced to retreat. Finally ovewhelming force had to be used to eliminate Viktor and to prevent major embarrassment in the name of ""national security."" Tikkanen made remarks to update this novel. When Lt. Calley was responsible for the My Lai Massacre, he had to be the scapegoat even though he obeyed orders. The pictures of dead childen clinging to their dead mothers could not be ignored. The Lt. obeyed orders, but no higher ranking officers were held responsible. A jornalist got paid $100,000 for writing about the Lt. Yet, no one would have been paid ten dolloars for writing about nameless victims of the massacre. Jouranlists nailed Nixon for his indescrtions, but very little is even mentioned about the mass murder state of Lenin and Stalin.This novel is well worth reading with memorable quotes. When men are drunk, they know exactly what to do. Yet, when these men get sober, they realize sensible solutions will never occur. The notes and the Afterward are good introductions to Finnish History especially during the Communist Revolution and W.W. II.December 21, 2014James E.

"Father Ciszek, S.J., (1904-1984) wrote WITH GOD IN RUSSIA which is book of memoirs while incarcerated in the Soviet Union for fifteen years. Ciscek's book is full of surprises, Father Ciscek writing is  very graphic, descriptive, and detailed. His writing is suspenseful and leaves the reader with the view of ""what happens next.""Father Ciszek wrote about his younger years of which he was not proud. He was a tough kid and a bully. Without an explanation or an epiphany, Father Ciszek suddenly decided to study for the priesthood. Later, in spite of his father's objections, Ciscek made another sudden decision to join the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits). As an aside, the Jesuits can be very obedient and/or very defiant. Father Ciscek fit both descriptions. He was athletic and did exhaustive exercies. Ciscek was also impulsive and once committed to ""a cause,"" he was not to be denied. Ciszek volunteered for the Vatican's Russicum which was a missionary school to send Catholic priests to the Soviet Unionto celebrate Mass and the Sacraments. The undersigned viewed this effort as suicide missions given the vigorus police state under Stalin. Father Ciszek went to Poland and then volunteered to go to the USSR under the guise of a worker in the Urals where he worked hard. An interesing anecdote is that of a Polish Jewish fellow who was fooled by the promises of ""The Workers' Paradise."" This young man was shocked by the harsh realities of Soviet society.While working in the Urals as a logger, Father Ciscek was discovered as a Catholic Jesuit priest and was charged as a spy for the Vatican. He was held in the infamous Lubyanka prison for about five years under very harsh conditions. When W.W.II started, Ciszek hoped the Germans would bomb the prison and the prison trains to either escape or get killed and be out of their misery. After physical abuse and torture, Ciszek was sentence to a concentration camp in Norilsk which over four degrees nother of the Arctic Circle or about over 70 miles north of the Arctic Circle. Ciszek worked loading coal which was a dangerous job. Ciszek mentioned working in dark areas avoiding flying coal the size of a skull. Some inmates were seriously injured or killed.Ciszek also described conflicts between political prisoners and violent offenders. Violent non-poltical prisoners would try to intimidate political prisoners. Such conflcits erupted into violence which guards worked to suppress. Ciszek was clever. He described an incident whereby some thug tried to steal from him. Ciscek reminded the thug that all the prisoners ""were in the same boat,"" and the thug could make a bad situation worse. Ciszek graphically described the murder and violence of prisoner-on-prisoner violence. One man was attacked by an inmate who hit him with sledge hammer. Ciscek mentioned that as Catholic priest, Ciscek had heard the victim's confession and gave the poor soul absolution prior to the victim's death.On the other hand, some of the more violent offenders were cordial and even protective of Father Ciszek. Ciszek's reputation of honesty and respect attracted other violent prisoners. A Mongolian and an inmate called the Turk or the Ottoman became Ciszek's close friends. Some of the inmates who worked in the medical facilities helped Ciszek to get light work, and Ciszek learned pharmacy, medical techniques, and care. Ciszek also learned to be a mechanic and construction trades. During Ciscek's incarceration, he courageously celebrated Mass and repeatedly administered the Sacraments which was dangerous to say the least.The concentration camp experience became more dangerous in 1953 when Stalin died. The inmates in ""The Gulag Archigelago"" rebelled in violent classes with guards. These rebellions erupted in many Soviet concentration camps, and only when disciplined Soviet troops were called to crush the rebellions did ""law and order"" resume. Ciszek wrote the concentration camp conditions significantly improved, and those who survived the rebellions had better living concitions.Finally in 1955, Ciscek was released and lived as ""A free man restricted."" He resumed his priestly duties and was able to establish a parish or sorts in spite of threats. Ciszek was threatened with arrest under Soviet ""law"" which forbade clergy from getting paid for religious work. Ciszek defended himself by proving he got no pay. He was beloved by Ukrainians, Russian Orthodox Christians, and other Eastern Europeans and Asians. Ciszek so infuriated the authorities that was sent to another town where he worked hard as mechanic and was given several awards for his hard work and skillYet, Ciszek wanted to return to the US. In 1955. he managed to get a letter to his sister. In spite burearcratic delays, Ciszek was transferred to European Russia in 1963. He was treated very well by the USSR authorities in Moscow and was ""wined and dined."" In 1963, Father Ciszek, S.J. flew to the US. While in Moscow, Ciszek visited Lenin's tomb and prayed for Lenin with the remark re Lenin""...he may need more prayers than he is getting here. Ciscek remarked that when he met with US officials, these officials were among the first to refer to him as Father Ciscek.Father Ciszek's book is full of suspense. To use an overused expression, his book is ""a page turner."" This reviewer believes that Father Ciszek was either reckless, masochistic, or divinely inspired. A good companion book is Alexander Solzhenitsyn GULAG ARCHIPELAGO. Readers should that Father Ciszek's experience was rare given the massive deaths in Soviet concentation camps. So many died, that Siberian construction workers had to stop work because of mass graves. The book is both depressing and ""uplifitng.""James E.

"Eugene C. Black edited an informative collection of essays re European Liberalism from 1815-1870. This collection of essays dealt with the political sympathies and antagonisms between ""Classical Liberals"" and working class Europeans. Some of the essays examined living standards, effects of disease, diplomatic successses and failures, and reinterpretation of the some of well known European historical figures.The first essay examined the rising living living standards in England between 1800-1815. R. Max Hartwell's essay made a good case that England's working classes actually had increased living standards. Industry, technology, and railroad construction lowered prices and provided employment. While wages did not rise much, prices of basic goods and services dropped increasing living standards. Reform legislation improved sanitation and limits on child labor. While contemporay Americans would not tolerate working and living conditions in England between 1800-1815, these living standards were much better for the English classes in the 19th. century than previous centuries. This reviewer found this essay convincing. Too many conventional historians try to ""read back"" from current times which is always a bad mistake.Asa Briggs wrote an essay re the effects of cholera and politics in Western Euroepan, especially Great Britian and France. The epidemiologists learned to be humble, and no one could explain the contagion. Some political leaders argued that the illness was confined to poor working class areas. Yet, some working class neighborhoods had practically no incidents of cholera while other working class neighborhoods had epidemics. Even more mysterious was the fact that in some working class nighborhoods one side of a street was spared the disease while other sides of the same street had epidemics. The unusual phenomenum invited political opportunism, but political complaints could not explain the disparities. As an aside, interested readers should read the book titled RATS, LICE, AND HISTORY.Robert Kann's essay re Prince von Metternich (1773-1859) was written as a re-evalution of Metternich. Metternich was often considered ""The Evil Genius of Reaction."" Metternich justly feared the rise of Nationalism. The Hapsburg Empire had an oleo of national minorities, and Metternich knew the potential for national rebellions which would have disintergrated the multinational empire. What Metternich also knew was the fact that these minorities would turn on each other in fits of violence inviting the Russians to intervene. Kann compared Metternich with Pres. Wilson. The big difference re Metternich & co. is that they were well informed re European History and politics. Metternich's policies were designed to promote peace and to ""keep the lid"" on national hatreds and war. Wilson & co. actively intervened in W.W. I and knew nothing about European History. Metternich's policies promoted peace. Wilson's policies led to the bloodiest century in history.Douglas Johnson's essay re the French politician, Guizot (1787-1874), showed the tensions even within the French ""liberal ranks."" The June Days of 1848 rebellions frightened ""Classical Liberals."" While the liberals opposed monarchy, they saw ""democracy"" as possible mobocracy. As a political figure, Guizot had to reconcile, or try to reconcile, these poltical tensions. He did the best anyone could do at the time, and his critics fail to take into account the difficult poltical confrontations he had to face.Irene Collins' essay re 19th. century ""Classical Liberalism"" was informative to say the least. The essay explored the original defiintions of liberalism, and some were critical and some were favorable. One of the issues that European Liberalism faced was the problem of social reform. Classical Liberals wanted limited state action, but social reform re the working classes and their increasing numbers forced factory reform and state imposed sanitation which were practical reforms. In other words, political reality and desparate health conditions led to practical solutions which ran against idealistic ""Classical Liberalism.""Lewis Namier's essay re Nationality and Liberty was similiar to above essay re Metternich.Namier's thesis was that liberty and nationality are mutually exclusive. Liberty means, among other things, freedom of press, speech, religion, and legal due process. Yet, many leaders of nationalism refuted these concepts. Nationalism often included bitter religious hatred, suppression of cultural and political dissent, and violence against those who were ""different."" As Namier noted, the contraditions are obvious. The horrible results of W.W. I, W.W. II, the rise of ""Fascism,"" and Big Communism confirmed Namier's thesis.Another diplomatic essay was written by A. J. P. Taylor. Taylor's essay re the Crimean War is ""different"" and well done. This was, as in most cases, an unnecessary war. The squabble between Russian Orthodox clergy and Roman Catholic clergy should NEVER have led to war. As Taylor described the war, it was a ""war that would not boil. The British were the primary beneficiaries in that they again kept the Russians out of the Mediterrean Sea. Napolean III and the French only got glory. The Russians had their incompetence exposd without any attempt at later reform. The Turks disappointed their ""allies"" by refusing to make necessary reforms.Raymond Grew made some interesting commentary re the Italian Risorgimento. Grew critisized Cavour whose alleged ""Classical Liberalism"" was more cynicism than liberalism Cavour was ""more concerend with moderation,"" but Garibaldi was more concerned about Italy. When Garibaldi conceded to Cavour, Garibaldi unknowingly betrayed his Red Shirts and Italian freedom. The following reforms after Cavour restricted the franchise and reform rather than expand these policies which Garibaldi wanted.A.J.P. Taylor wrote another essay in this anthology re Bismarck's policy. For better or worse, Bismark was a clever manipulator. As Taylor noted Bismarck manipulated different political parties against each and in favor of Bismarck. Bismarck's sponsored social legislation such as Workmen's Compensation, ""socialized medicine,"" and Social Security benefits finally muted the fast growing German Socialist party. Bismarck's hasty retreat from his anti-Catholic laws kept the Center parties in line since many members of the Center parties were Catholic. After the unification of the Germans in 1871, Bismarck used effective diplomacy to keep the Russians, the Hapsburgs, the Italians, and the French tied to his policies and maintained peace.John Gallagher and Ronald Robinson contributed an interesing essay comparing Imperialism and ""Free Trade."" The expansion of the Europeans' empires, especially the British empire, had little to do with free trade. The European expansion into Africa beginning c. 1870 was described as ""scrapping of the bottom of the barrel."" The fact that ""free trade"" included force and resticted access to markets and resources. The reality betrayed the ideal.These essays give readers and historians reasons to think and reinterpret long established mythis and realities of European Classical Liberalism. The essays are not dated in spite of the fact the book was first publsihed in 1967. This book is much preferred to badly written textbooks and media nonsense. The undersigned enjoyed the book and learned from the contents.James E.

"Father Baron is a productive Catholic priest whose books are readable, subtle, thought provoking, and perhaps too optimistic. Baron's book titled BRIDGING THE GREAT DIVIDE should appeal to readers with ""residual common sense."" Some of the essays in this book were written for more ""advanced"" readers especially those dealing with St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Augustine, and Father Merton. Other essays appeal to those who are not well read re history, philosophy, and theology. The essays have connections and should be read patiently.The first essay focused on the Cardinal Roncalli's,the future Pope John XXIII, remark re Vatican II reforms. As Father Baron commented, the Pope John XXIII and the Vatican II attendees wanted to build a bridge between what should be conserved and what can be ""reconfigured."" As Baron noted, the Catholic Church should be an active force for good rather than ""a museum piece."" An ""Orthodox"" Catholic made the statement that those Catholics who did not agree with her visions of Catholicism to leave the Catholic Church. As an aside, she did have any plan to force them to leave. On the other hand, other Catholics want to dilute Catholicism to the point of meaninglessness.  Baron included a litany of saints who had different views, and yet remained within the Catholic Church.Father Baron cited Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin as examples of Catholics who ""bridged the gap."" Dorothy Day was a Communist, a Socialist, and finally a devout convert to Catholcism. Her Catholic Worker Movement was a valiant effort to help destitute people. She was considered a ""leftist"" and a ""radical."" Anyone who now shows compassion and kindness is now considered a radical. One should note that the early Catholic martyrs were considered ""radicals."" On the other hand, Dorothy Day attended Mass every day, prayed the Rosary, kept the Office of the Hours, and was as devout as any devout monk or nun.What is Catholicism? An obvious answer is that Catholicism is a major religion. Father Baron defines Catholcism as ""The Way."" The Way is not only to be studied and defended. The Way is to be lived as though Catholicism is relevant and vital. While participating in the Sacraments is important, the Sacraments are of little use if Catholics do not walk The Way and adhere to what are known as ""The Cardinal Virtues."" Father Baron used a remark made by the late Bishop Sheen. Sheen said that the Three Wise Men left the Infant Christ and returned home another way. No one who encounters Christ can return the same way. In other words, men and woman who are serious about Catholicism must live a different way (The Way). The world should not change the Catholic Liturgy. The Catholic Liturgy should change the world for the better.As mentioned above, Father Baron used St. Thomas's work to enhance these essays. Baron made some philosophical comments about St. Thomas Aquinas and the late Blessed Pope John Paul II. St. Thomas Aquinas and John Paul II argued that God and people are in a human and divine order that brings people closer to each other and  to the Divine. Reason and study of Creation give examples of the finite world which can lead to the Divine and the Sacred. The philosophical and theological reasoning can help those not familiar with these studies. Father Baron wrote that true freedom is authenic truth and not trivia. Father Baron viewed the Cosmos as an example of God as an artist. This requires men and woman to recognize good vs. evil and beauty vs. the ugly. To appreciate what is good and what is beauty, people must be able to contrast such concepts with what is evil and ugly. The ability to use reason and understanding to know the difference is what makes us truly human and truly humane.In re evil, Father Baron had an interesing interpretation of the Fall. The Adam/Eve story is NOT  negative narrative of people as depraved. Father Baron argued that the Adam/Eve expulson from Eden was a transition for child-like innocence to adult awareness of good vs evil and responsiblity. This is not to say that defiance of the command of forbidden fruit was right. The lesson is that innocent children become adults and question what may be arbitrary authority. Not all authority is justified or right, and people learn this lesson for better or worse. Again, the knowledge of good and evil should be necessary for the Human Condition. The Incarnation may have been an effort to help people to recognize false piety, hypocricy, and insensitive authority.Father Baron wrote that true authenticity requires patience and no ""quick answers."" Baron's essay re such patience used the Advent Season as a background for this essay. What does Advent actually mean? Father Baron used a comment from Father Diekmann about the key concept of people. Father Diekmann used the term ""Diefication"" meaning that people are diefied by God, and men and women have the responsibility to live according to such a status. For Father Baron this meant that people must show compassion, mercy, kindness, bona fide love, and forgiveness. One must wonder how far the current culture has betrayed these concepts.One section of the book that did not provide good answers was Father Baron's treatment of the problem of evil. He used sections from the book of Job which are unsatisfactory. Father Baron's remark that natural and human disasters may lead to a better future is of NO consolation to those who suffer. Father Baron made a valiant attempt to reconcile the problem, but his arguements go begging. However, his explanation is better than most this reviewer has read. The book titled JOB AND THE EXCESS OF EVIL is another good attempt to explain the problem of evil.Theologcally the Cosmos was made by God and was ""made good."" Father Baron focused on Father Thomas Merton's efforts to establish peace. The thesis here is that violent competition and neglect of the concepts in the above paragraphy are a divorce of the Way (Christ's Way). As Father Baron explained, if some aggressive over-bearing person is confronted by another over-bearing person, conflict is inevitable. However if each is met by kindness and avoiding violence, what can the aggressive person do? Gandhi is a good example of this non-violent resistence. Blessed Mother Teresa either ignored fools and continued her work, or she refuted critics with searing response.The last sections of the book dealt with the status of Catholic clergy. Too often the Holy Office of the priesthood is either marginalized or reduced to irrelevancy. Catholic parishoners too often do not know that Catholic priests ""do not grow on trees,"" and a shortage of priests exists. Catholics should be in a position to help Catholic clergy rather than express complaints and lack of concern or help. Catholics should not take Catholic priests for granted. As Father Baron noted, the indifference toward Catholic priests is cause for concern.Father Baron's book takes time and focus. His writing is clear, and the philosophical topics require attention to understand. If some readers claim the topics are above their heads, then they should stretch their necks. While some of the topics are philosophical and intellectual, Father Baron is certainly no snob. This reviewer's only criticism is that Father Baron is too optimistic. In an age of trivial concerns and praise of unbridled violence, Father Baron may despair. However, this book is well worth reading.James E.

"J.L. Witterick's book titled MY MOTHER'S SECRET is a tale of rare courage, compassion, mercy, forgiveness, and bona fide love. Some of the statements are thoughtful and a reminder of whom we should be rather than who we are in times of oppression and tyranny.Wittterick's book began with a husband and wife (Franciszka)debating the rise of Hitler & co. Franciszka had insight to know what could happen and had bitter arguements with her husband who prasied the rise of Hitler and Hitler's supporters. This debate led to a separation when Franciszka left her husband moved to Poland.Events quickly forced Franciszka and her daughter Helena to make decisions about ""doing the right thing"" is spite of deadly risks involved. Helena got a job with a company headed by Casmir who had connections in Germany. When W.W. II erupted in 1939, Franciszka sheltered Jewish people and German deserter. Witternick commented that Franciszka told Helena, the daughter, that doing the right thing becomes a reflex if one has the character to do so.The book related that when W.W. II began, Franciszka and her family were on the Russian side  because the Germans and Soviets agreed via secret protocol to invade and divide Poland. However, when the Germans and Soviets turned on each other, the Franciszka family were under German occupation which was especially lethal to Jewish people. Franciszka and Helena had a balancing act of harboring two Jewish families and a German solider. This was at a time when many neighbors were rewarded for being informers, and the mother and daughter had to be careful that they did not reveal their refugees which would have meant death to all concerned.Bascially Helena wanted to be with her employer Casmir whom she loved. However, Helena had to stay with her mother to help protect the refugees. Helena faced the issue of what is right vs. what I want. The tense situation was made worse when Franciszka learned that her son Damian died helping partisans against the Germans. Yet, Franciszka and Helena remained undaunted.The book then describes the views of the refugees. The German deserter Vilheim gave anecdotes of his dangerous situation. He was not meant to be a soldier and did not want to kill or be killed. His status as a refugee was tenuous because Frnaciszka was also harboring Jewish people, and she did not want the German soldier to know of the Jewish refugees. This was a delicate balancing act to say the least.A tragic bit of treachery occured when workers were recruited to work for brick factory only to be shot when they arrived. The Jewish workers thught they had a chance to get income for their families to survive only to lose their lives. A pharmacist betrayed Jewish people by informing on them. When the pharmacist discovered that the Wolenski family who were Jewish were being sheltered, the father, Dr. Wolenski, offered medical care to avoid being reported to the German authorities. The ploy worked.Dr. Wolenski and family were typical Jewish people. In spite of living in cramped, dangerous condtions, they did the best they could to insure that the children had books and learning. Dr. Wolenski was grateful to Frnaciszka and after W.W. II, showed his gratitude without being asked to do so. Righteous Gentiles and Jewish people shared the concepts of compassion, kindness, mercy, etc.What did this book teach? The book taught that fear is normal, but one should show courage in spite of fear. The book also taught readers something about shared kindness and gratitude. The characters in the book survived the war and extended their gratitude long after W.W. II was over. What else did this book teach? The book further taught that ""The standard defines the exception"" and the potential actually to be great.J. L. Winnerick's book is a good antidote to the willful stupidity that exists. At a time, when too many hate mongers want to demonize people because of ethnic origins, language, religion, etc., this book is a reminder of what can be done. This writer went though ""dark times,"" but he met people who reminded him of the characters in this book who helped escape such dark times. This book reminded the undersigned that the concept of ""Original Sin"" is not that we are depraved. Orginal Sin means that people are not as good as they can be. An adage states that it is easy to be right when everyone else is right. However, it is difficult or even dangeous to be right when everyone else is wrong. This writer enjoyed the book and enjoyed the other well written reviews. The only regret this writer has is that he did not read the book sooner. This book is HIGHLY recommended.James E.

"James Burham (1905-1987)once wrote that hypocrisy was England's greatest export. William Cobbett (1763-1835) could have written that hypocrisy was England's greatest gross domestic product. Cobbett's book titled A HISTORY OF THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION IN ENGLAND AND IRELAND made this point very well. Readers must remember that Cobbett was PROTESTANT, but he had a passion for truth. He was bascially self-taught, and he did a credible job in exposing the terrible consequences of the English Reformation(s). Readers should note that Francis Cardinal Gasquet, D.D., OSB (1846-1919)edited the book by citing references and making minor corrections which provided a  bona fide list of sources to easily support Cobbett's book.Cobbett started this book by underming some of the erroneous claims made against the Catholic Church. One false claim that Cobbett refuted was that Medieval monks/nuns were the carriers of ""monkish"" ignorance and superstition. During the so-called Dark Ages (c. 500-c. 750), the Catholic monks and nuns were almost exclusively the only learned people. They assisted the poor, opened schools to as many people as possible, hand copied books and created libraries when many people were illiterate. Cobbett chided Blackstone (1723-1780), a well known English jurist when Blackstone wrote about Catholic ignorance. Blackstone knew very well that abbeys, monastaries, etc. were built by Catholics who taught students including law where Blackstone was housed. The Magna Carta and concepts of due process and legal ""fair play"" were part of English Catholic Constitutional History.Cobbett also stressed the fact that much of England was pagan prior to 597 when St. Augustine, d. 601, and not to be confused with the other St. Augustine (354-430),brought Catholicism to England in 597. Pope Adrian IV (1155-1159)was an Englishman. Monks and nuns helped the English acquire learning and were a valuable asset to the poor via hospices, legal protections re property, etc. Yet, the English ""Reformation"" begun by Henry VIII (1491-1547) ended these achievements. The monastaries, convents, other Catholic property were unlawfully confiscated by Henry's henchmen especially Thomas Cromwell (1485-1540). Marriages were unlawfully disolved. Henry VIII had his daughters Mary and Elizabeth declared illegitimate and had Anne Bolyn unlawfully executed. The ""divorce"" between Henry and Catherine of Aragon was also unlawful which caused Henry to start the English ""Reformation.""Cobbett had more criticism re the English ""Reformations(s)."" The English complaint that they had to pay Peter's Pence to support the Catholic Church was shallow. The English paid more in one year for foreign mercenaries than they paid in four centuries re Peter's Pence. Henry VIII did not think he separated from Catholcism, but the splinter groups caused problems. The situation was so bad that men and women were tortured and executed for believing in the Real Presence and then for not believeing it. Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603)exceeded Henry VIII's cruelty in arresting and torturing Catholics and dissident Protestants. One of Eliabeth's first official acts was to order the execution of four Anabaptists by burning at the stake. When some refer to Elizabeth's predecessor, Mary, as ""Bloody Mary,"" they omit the fact that  Elizabeth's mass executions of Catholics and dissent Protestants  made Mary's executions look tame by comparison. When the ""powers-that-be"" could not find enough Catholics to murder, they turned on each other because of lethal greed and power lust. Cobbett mentioned that family loyalty was so diminished that James I appointed advisors who had James' mother put to death via an illegal trial. Cobbett made numerous references of the valuable services of Catholic priests, nuns, monks, etc. prior to the Reformation. Records, docuements were trusted to these Catholics who were known for their learning and honesty.As Cobbett repeatedly wrote, 900 years of English Catholic History were prosperous by comparison. Learning was encouraged, and, again, the ""lower classes"" has a reasonable living compared to the Reformation and thereafter. The middle class and poor were so dispossed by the Reformation that the English had Poor Laws for the destitute which were unknown in England prior to the Reformation. John Locke (1632-1704)chided the wretched poor for being lazy and shiftless. What he omitted in this ""official"" report is that the poor folks' ancestors were driven from their land. He failed to note that many of the poor were denied entry into the job market. These poor souls were punished for begging. Their ""wages"" if they had any were kept below subsistence levels. Locke forgot that restrictions and other ""legal"" impediments kept men and women from gainful employment. The English were so paranoid that a monument was erected blaming Catholics for the 1666 London Fire. No evidence exists whatsoever to support such an outrageous claim.Not only did the English ""Reformation"" cause terrible problems in England, but the Reformation seriously hurt English foreign policy. Queen Elizabeth betrayed so many different factions in France, that she HAD to withdraw troops from different intrigues. When William and Mary were illegally installed as King/Queen of England in 1688, they ventured on foreign adventures in Europe which required the English to establish a national debt to be paid by the middle class and poor to the financial interests. In other words, the English exhausted their options for bleeding the middle classes and poor which required future debt.When the English tried to impose their ""system"" on the American colonists who benefitted from years of  legal neglect, the imposition of such measures that had worked in England were successfully resisted, and the English had to face the reality that their system had ""seen better days."" Cobbett then directed his attention to the French Revolution which struck fear in England. Perhaps out of fear and desparation, the English began relaxing their lethal laws against Catholics to gain political unity. The English expressed shock at the French Revolution and the revolutionary persecution of French Catholics. The French had learned very well that plunder and massacres of Catholics had worked before in England. These events were in effect ""a blessing in disguise"" for English and Irish Catholics who could say, ""I told you so.""Cobbetts' book and Cardinal Gasquet's editing make this a well researched book that undermines bias and dishonest history. The book is ""an eye opener"" for those who have been exposed to bias and dishonest history. Careful readers should read the notes and comments to grasp the importance and accuracy of the book.James E.

"Father Jaki, OSB (1924-2009), was a devout Catholic and a brilliant physicist, mathematician, and astronomer. He was also a historian and a profound thinker. His book titled MIRACLES AND PHYSICS is a combative rebuttal re those who scoff at the concept of miracles. Fr. Jake ""took no prisoners"" in writing this book. Fr. Jaki also showed a sense of humor in an otherwise very serious book.Fr. Jaki cited Hippolyte Taine(1828-1893)who stated that if the Catholic Church officials and scholars survived Darwinism, they would survive anything. Now, Darwin's (1809-1882)theory has been seriously challenged if not rebutted. Readers should know that Fr. Jaki was not a literalist or fundamentalist. He knew too much about physics and astronomy to accept the literal biblical account of Creation. He also saw the Bible in an allegorical sense but not nonsense. Fr. Jaki let readers know that the Catholic Church has EASILY survived the challenge of Darwinism. Fr. Jaki had harsh words for those who try to be ""trendy"" and ""modern"" when they try to dabble and use arcane philosophy in their writing which is so much ""academic bafflegab."" He cited a quote from THE SCOTSMAN (December 16, 1988: p. 12) which is as follows:Jesus said to them, ""Who do you say that I am?"" They replied, ""You are the eschatological manifestation of the gorund of our being, the kerygma of which we find the ultimate meaning in our interpersonal relationships."" And Jesus said, ""What?""Fr. Jaki also refutted the notion that quantum mechanics, probabilty theory, etc. did not have ""the final answers"" re science. Fr. Jaki carefully explained that certain events were beyond scientific explanation, and these rare events are miracles. Fr. Jaki critisized Neils Bohn (1885-1962) and Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976)who concluded that miracles do not exist. Fr. Jaki carefully explained the ""gaps"" that 20th. century physicists simply could not explain. Fr. Jaki showed the ""shortcomings' of Max Planc's (1858-1947) view of determinism.Fr. Jaki credited those men who were devout Catholics such as Pierre Duhem (1861-1916)who was a scientific scholar and a devout Catholic. Duhem wrote about the achievements of devout religious men and women who contributed to scientific knowledge. Readers should read Duhem's work and/or Fr. Jaki's book re Duhem. Fr. Jaki remarked that determinists and scientific ideologues are so imbued with their theories that they want to write about nature as if there were no nature. One biblical passage that Fr. Jaki cited was Exodus 3:14-17 when God told Moses that He (God) is I AM WHO I AM. This is a profound yet mysterious statement and adds mystery to what we already know.Fr.Jaki's last section of the book is an attack of those who deny any possibility of miracles. For example, Fr. Jaki described the early Catholic martyrs who died agnonizing deaths in part because of their belief in miracles. No one dies like that for trite reasons. Fr. Jaki wrote about those miracles at Lourdes. Alexis Carrel (1873-1944)won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1912 and was an atheist and cynic. Yet, he personally witnessed miracles at Lourdes which could not be explained and converted to Catholicism. When St. Bernadette (1844-1879) was questioned about what she experienced at Lourdes,she responded that her duty was to report what happened and not to make others believe it.Fr. Jaki should have condemned the phony ""faith healers: and televangelists whose fakes give miracles a bad name. However, NO ONE can claim that Fr. Jaki, a brilliant man of science, was some sort of superstitious charlatan. The undersigned does not want to give the pretense that he understood all the physics that Fr. Jaki mentioned in this book. Yet, the book was well written that anyone with ""residual common sense"" can grasp the thesis of the book.James E.

"Catholic bashers and those who deride Pope Pius XII should avoid Ronold J. Rychlak and his book HITLER, THE WAR, AND THE POPE. The author and the book destroys all the nonsense smears of Pope Pius XII and Catholcism. Rychlak, J.D., teaches Law at the University of Mississippi and demonstrated meticulous research in this book. Rychlak penetrated Pope Pius XII' careful thinking and Pius's courageous actions.Rychlak started this book with a brief account Eugenio Pacelli's (1876-1958), the future Pope Pius XII, career. Pacelli was an excellent student and very early in his life showed intelligence, class, strength of character, and undaunted courage. Pacelli was quickly promoted in the Catholic hierarchy, and impressed those whom he met whether or not they were Catholic.Rychlak wrote about Pacelli's courage while Pacelli was a Papal Nuncio in Germany just after W.W. I. Pacelli's mission was to help alleviate the suffering and hardship inflicted on the Germans after the First World War. A gang of violent communists threatened Pacelli's life and pushed a gun into his chest. Pacelli was not phased and shamed the gang members by reminding them that he (Pacelli) was on a mission of peace. He blessed his would-be murderers who left. Pacelli must have made a favorable impression because some of these communists returned and profusely apologized for their bad actions and behavior. Pacelli also showed that he followed Christ's message of forgiveness. Pacelli refused to cooperate with the police re questioning and probably knew that his attackers may ""have learned their lesson.""Rychalk cited Pacelli's warnings about the newly formed National Socialist movement whose future leader was Hitler. In 1921, 1923, and in 1926, Pacelli warned about this new political movement and its pagan, racist overtones. Readers should note that Pacelli was one of the very first to alert Europeans and Catholics the actual danger of the potential of the National Socialist movement.Rychlak also condemned the efforts of Big Communism to exterminate the Catholic Church. While the focus of the book dealt with Pius XII and the threat from the Germans authorites, Rychlak provided a brief summary of the mass murder of Catholic and Orthodox clergy in the Soviet Union. By 1922, over 8,100 Catholic clergy, monks, nuns, and monks were murdered. As an aside, some ambitious historian should write a book about the attempts to mass murder Catholics in the USSR and areas that came under Soviet  control.Rychlak then examined the Catholic Church in Germany in the 1930s. Hitler & co. were not happy with German Caholics whose voting mostly opposed National Socialist candidates. Pacelli and many Catholics were not fooled by Hitler & co.'s anti-Communism. These Catholics knew that National Socialism contradicted Catholic teaching, and they made their views well known at great personal risk. Pius XII' predecessor, Pope Piux XI (1922-1939)issued the Papal Encyclical MIT BRENNEDER SORGE in 1937 which was a stinging indictment of National Socialist ideology. Readers should note that Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pope Pius XII, wrote this document. In fact Vatican officials including Pacelli refused to host Hitler when he visited Italy.As noted above, Rychlak wrote about Pacelli's courage in German during the 1920s. Rychlak cited later examples. When German authorities threated Pius with arrest and placement in a concentration camp, Pius defied these authorities and was bluntly clear he was not the least bit intimidated. Pope Pius XII was well aware of plot via Hitler & co. to invade the Vatican and massacre the Curia and Pius himself if necessary. Yet, Pius refused all pleas to leave the Vatican for safe haven. The details of this plot are well doucmented in Kurzman's book titled A SECRET MISSION. When Rome and parts of the Vatican were bombed by the ""allies,"" Pius absolutely refused to go to a bomb shelter and went to the affected areas to administer Last Rites and provide relief.Pope Pius XII's efforts to help refugees including Jewish refugees extended to Eastern Europe. Jewish historians Pinchas Lapide and Jano Levai thoroughly documented these efforts. Any Catholic clergy who collaborated with anti-Jewish authorities were defrocked and excommunicated. Pius was blunt about the mission and teaching of the Catholic Church and Catholic reaction in the midst of terrible evil.Rychlak wrote extensively of prominent Jews who were so very grateful of Pius' efforts to rescue Jews and relieve their suffereing. Many Catholics who made such couragous efforts did so at the risk of their lives, and some became martyrs in doing so. Rychlak etal. gave high praise to both Pius and those Catholics who showed calm reserve in the midst of such grave danger. In spite of orders from German and Italian authorities not to help refugess including Jewish refugees, the Catholics did so regardless of the risks. Rychlak provided humorous ruses used by Catholics to smuggle food and medicine as well as provide escape to those who were arrested.Rychlak wrote about Pius's tenure after W.W. II. Pius was praised by well known Jewish dignitaries, and Rabbi Israel Zolli, Chief Rabbi of Rome, converted to Catholicism. Rabbi Herzog who was the Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem offered such high praise. Many Protestants including the late President Eisenhower also offered praise and honor to Pope Pius XII. The testimonies and documents in praise re Pope Pius XII are overwhelming as are the bona fide documents.After Pius died on 10/9/1958, cowards tried to villfy him. Yet, these smears are easily refuted. For example, Cornwell's book HITLER's POPE has been destroyed by historians who rely on documents and not hysteria and hate. Cornwell's book jacket proved to be a lie. The cover has Pius XII meeting Hitler with guards wearing modern German uniforms. The photo is fake. The original photo was taken in 1929 when Pacelli met Von Hindengerg, and the guards  actually wore very traditional uniforms. In fact, Pope Pius XII NEVER met Hitler. Pius's detractors have been trounced in debates with Pius's defenders and have been reduced to whining that proof contrary to their lies hurt their feelings and made them angry. One should note Pius' detractors now avoid debate with those who have read the documents and know the truth.Prof. Rychlak wrote a solid book based on meticulous research. His notes and bibliography are comprehensive and more than enough to substantiate his thesis that Pope Pius XII was a great man whose courage, intelligence, and tact were rare during a time of evil and immense tragedy.James E.

"Sister Marchione, Ph.D. wrote a passionately yet well documented book about Pope Pius XII's rare courage, intelligence, and compassion. While Sr. Marchione is an ardent defender of Pope Pius XII, she substantiated her enthusiasm by solid research and good writing. Much of what she wrote in this book can be gleanred from her other well written books on behalf of Pope Pius XII.Sister Marchione began the book with citations from LIFE MAGAZINE (December 13, 1954)which were glowing attributes of Pius's efforts during W.W. II to rescue refugees including Jewish refugees. She made use of a NEW YORK TIMES (October 15, 1945)feature in praise of Pope Pius XII.Part I of Sister Marchione's book gave a precis of Pope Pius XII's life. He was named Eugenio Pacelli and his life span was from 1876-1958. His parents were well connected to Vatican authorities. The Pacelli family had close friendship with the Mendes family who were Jewish, and Pius XII helped a family member escape Europe during W.W. II. Pacelli was an excellent student and decided early that he wanted to become a Catholic priest. His intelligence and thoughtfulness were noticed by Vatican officials, and he was appointed Bishop and sent as a Papal nuncio to Germany after W.W. I to help with relief efforts. Pacelli did so well that he was appointed as Cardinal and eventually was elected Pope.Sister Marchione further described Pope Pius XII as optimistic, very generous, courageous, and yet humble. Pope Pius XII had a serious concern for justice, and he also had a sense of humor. When Hitler's attempt to overthrow the Bavarian governmment in 1923 failed, Pacelli etal stated that Hitler would never come to power. Later when confronted with the fact that Hitler did rise to power, Pacelli was then Pope. Pope Pius XII joked that he was not so infallible in 1923. As Pope Pius XII said, ""Laughter has no religion.""As noted above, Pope Pius XII was a humble man. Sister Marchione commented that Pope Pius XII did not promote his good deeds, but others have done so. In 1987, Pope John Paul II publicly noted Pius's courage and good deeds. W.W. II veterans on ""both sides"" such as Leonardo Marinelli who was an Italian commander in Northern Italy made such mention in 1943.  A young Italian priest arranged for 300 Yugoslavian Jewish people to go to Switzerland.What may surprise some readers is that many Protestants also had high regard for Pope Pius XII. One Kansas Baptist family gave their tithe to The Holy See because of what Pope Pius XII did for their son during W.W. II. As an aside some French Socialists who were atheists wrote a tome on behalf of Pope Pius XII.Those who were in Europe and in Rome and are still alive gave further evidence of Pope Pius XII's compassion, kindness, mercy, etc. Sister Marchione cited a comment from Francis Paul DiBlasi, Jr. who was in Rome during W.W. II. which highly praised Pius XII. Sigrid Ruedel Crane of Virginia lived in Germany before and during W.W. II. She related that some of the Catholic priests were arrested and sent to concentration camps. Yet, she well knew of Pope Pius XII's efforts and determination to help the helpless. Sigrid made an important remark that those who attack Pope Pius XII were not alive at the time and make baseless claims with no sources or understanding. As an aside, this reviewer is amused at Pope Pius XII's detractors and Catholic bashers. When confronted with bona fide sources that refute their bias, they can only get angry and use ad hominem arguements makiing themselves look foolish an petty. That is all they do when confronted with truth.Not only did Pope Pius XII do all he could to help the defenseless in Italy and Western Europe, but Pius XII did all he could in Eastern Europe. Documents prove that Pius XII ordered his Bishops and Cardinals in Eastern Europe to do they could for refugees including Jewish people. The Jewish historian Pinchas Lapide noted this in his book titled THREE POPES AND THE JEWS. Jeno Levai, another Jewish historian made the same assertion.Sister Marchione had a section re Pope Pius XII's Encyclicals  which clearly condemned racism, persecution, and blind hatred. His Christmas messages between 1940-1943 were heard throughout the world and refutes the charge of silence. Pope Pius XII knew he would be attacked. He helped a member of the Italian Communist Party to avoid arrest and gave this man refuge. Yet, this Communist tried to smear the Pope after W.W. II.Sister wrote an impassioned yet accurate account of Pope Pius XII. As one historian wrote, too many cowards tried to use Pope Pius XII as a scapegoat for the moral failure of others. Sister Marchione's books and bonifide documents refute smears against Pope Pius XII. The problem is the the detractors and Catholic bashers refuse to read the books or sources. However, the sources and books are available for the record.James E.

"Karl Keating, a learned and articulate ""Defender of the Faith,"" published an anthology of his work both defending ""The Faith"" and himself from false accusations and fabrications. Keating also defended well known Catholics from historical falsification and attacks bsased on ignorance and ""hot air.""The first essay in Keating' collections was titled ""When not to turn the Other Cheek."" Keating recounted the  dispute between Charles Kingsley, a history professor at Cambridge, and John Henry Newman. Kingsley blundered when he accused the Catholic Church intellectuals of disregarding the truth and briefly accused Newman of the same charge. Newman defied Kingsley to cite where Newman ever argued against the truth. Kingsley made his situation worse by adding further fabrications against Newman who refused to accept Kingsley's false accusations and INSISTED that Kingsley cite where Newman EVER argued against the truth. ""To make a long story short,"" Kingsley got hopelessly lost in adding ""fuel to the fire."" Newman did not engage in the dispute for his own reputation as he refuted Kingsley in the service of truth.This essay was followed by attacks on Keating himself. Keating used reason and humor to undermine false accusations against himself. Keating amused his readers with anecdotes which were illogical and humorously hysterical over a pamplet he has distributed when Pope John Paul II visited Colorado. Anyone who enjoys laugther would enjoy Keating's reason and wit in demolishing stupidty and petty hysteria.Keating had further remarks re Pope John II when the latter's view of evolution were altered by Professor Joy Stephen Gould who is a biology professor and populizer of the theory of evolution. Gould ""put words into Pope John Paul II's mouth"" re evolution. Pope John Paul II stated that evolution was a theory AND ONLY A THEORY. He never wrote that evolution was ""the last word"" but an aid, albeit and imperfect aid, in the study of biology. Keating contrasted  Pope John Paul II's remarks with Gould's misinterpretion of these remarks. In short, Keating ""set the record straight.Keating then turned his attention re Internet use. Because Keating did not agree with the National Catholic Register and their ""Sister L"" list, Keating was advised he could not comment via the Internet to disagree with NCR. Keating was quick to respond that the NCR folks and other Internet users boasted of diverse debates and open discussion while insisting the Keating not be permitted to do so. Keating effectively and with a sense of humor critisized such inconsistency.Another anecdote that Keating used as example of truth was the recent debate over biblical sources especially the Gospels and The New Testament. Many biblical historians date the New Testament's completion as late as 90-100 AD. Relying on recent scholarship, Keating made the case that the Gospels and The New Testament may have been  completed c. 68 AD. Keating suggested that an Aramaic New Testament was the original source from which the Koine Greek New Testament was based. Keating DID NOT claim to be the final word, but he was impressed with the new possibility. What drew Keating into this topic was arrogance of establishment scholars when the  older view was challenged. This reviewer accepts the dates of between c.90-c.100 AD, but Keating's suggestion may be right. The undersigned would agree if a complete Aramaic source were found.Keating showed a concern for truth when he launched a deadly attack on Ayn Rand's 1967 essay titled """"Requiem for Man"" in which she condemned the Catholic authorities and, at the time,  Pope Paul VI. Keating destroyed this essay. Rand wrote, among other things, that the Kremlin and the Vatican were akin in destroying man's mind. Rand altered some of Pope Paul VI's work and wrote as though no one would notice. Rand created history out of nothing in this essay. Rand condemned Socialism, Communism, and Fascism. However, she was not very good at history. Pope Leo XIII (1878-1903)condemned socialism in his encyclical titled RERUM NOVARUM. Pope Pius XI (1922-1939) condemned Big Communism, and Pope Pius XII (1939-1958) condemned Fascism. Rand's essay takes no note of previous Catholics who condemned authortarian political systems.As an aside, Rand argued that Catholicism controlled men's minds. What she did not know or want to know is that many recent scientific and mathematical achievements have been done by devout Catholics. Did Rand ever know about Father Gregor Mendel (1822-1884)who pioneered the study of genetics? Was she aware of Fr. Le Maitre (1894-1966)who created a mathematical model of the universe which Albert Einstein praised? Was Ayn Rand knowledgeable about the work of Fr. Stanley Jaki (1924-2009)who was a foremost physicist, mathematician, and astronomer? The Catholic authorities encouraged their work and highly praised these men and so much for Rand's silly remark that Catholicism wants to control ""men's minds.""Keating's essays on Catholicism in Japan and icons are just as interesting as the other essays in this book. Keatings keen obvervations of Greek Orthodox iconography are  graphic and clear. Keating wrote a depressing yet accurate account of the Catholic Church in Japan which was all but eliminated in the late 16th. and early 17th. centuries. When later Catholic missionaries visited Japan, they were surprised that residuals of Catholicism still existed.Keating's book is lively, terse, and interesting. Keating is a very learned man who is tough but not arrogant. This book is worth reading. The only complaint is that it does not have an index or bibliography. Readers should enjoy this book.James E.

"Father Thomas Keating, who is a Cistercian monk and not to be confused with Karl Keating, wrote REWAKENINGS to show readers the ""deeper meanings"" of familiar Gospel stories. The book is clear without ""over-simplifying"" some of examples he uses to embellish spiritual life.One example is the story of Christ feeding the 5,000 plus. The apparent impossible situation is explained in the Christ ""took a first step,"" and then He explained that the food was temporary when people should ultimately seek the ""Bread of Life"" which lasted longer than manna.Fr. Keating used the example St. Peter who lost faith and almost drowned re walking on water until he lost faith. He begged Christ for help which he got. What is the moral of the story? The moral is that people appeal and pray when they face ""life's storms. St. Peter could be intelligent and alert to Christ's teaching, and at other times, St. Peter was severely admonished by Christ. St. Peter could be a coward or he could be a saint. Fr. Keating had  interesting remarks re Christ's ""transfiguration"". Peter wanted to build monuments, but Christ said no and returned to teaching. The message is that when people are transfigured, they need to set an example rather than ""resting on their laurals.""Fr. Keating often referred to renewal and redemption. He used insight re the leper and the blind. These poor souls, perhaps ""dead souls,"" were physically cured and then had a spiritual awakening re mind and soul. Fr. Keating gave added intellectual dimension to the obvious narratives.Fr, Keating had more intelligent remarks about a nagging woman pleading her cause to corrupt judge who finally relented to her request just to avoid the constand nagging and not out of any sense of justice. The moral of this story is that God who is just will answer pleas even if at times the answer is NO.This reviewer was facinated by Fr. Keatings remarks re the incident re the ""woman taken in adultry."" Fr. Keating wrote that Christ was bored with Pharisees and ""knew their game."" If Christ agreed that according to Moses that the poor woman be stoned to death, He would betray His teaching of compassion, kindness, mercy, forgiveness, etc. If Christ refuted Moses Law, he could be accused of violating The Law of Moses. As stated, Fr. Keating wrote that Christ was bored with these Pharisees. He ""had seen it all before."" One must rhetorically ask how hard is it to find a ""wayward woman?"" Christ wrote something on the ground which may have been a report on the sins of the Pharisees. The same is true re the woman who washed Christ's feet and was forgiven. The Pharisee said Christ, as a prophet, should have know what sort of woman this person was. Christ blasted the Pharisee for being an ungracious host. As an aside, one may wonder how these self-rightousness Pharisees knew so much about ""wayward women.""Some of the essays dealt with Advent and Lent and the parable about alertness. Fr. Keating argued people should always be alert about Christ's teaching and example. Catholicism is a religion renewal, and Mass is celebrated every day to renew people to such alertness.Father Keating's book is readable helps readers to think more carefully about biblical anecdotes. This book is not popular religion, but any reader ""with residual common sense"" can profit from the book.

"Chandler A. Phillips, M.D., P.E. is an autodidact whose anthology re Aesop's Fables is a readable account with anecdotes that make serious readers think about ""the human condition."" Some of the anecdotes force readers to consider ""the lesser of two evils."" In other words, as bad as a situation is, the situation could be worse. Some of the anecdotes deal with deviousness, loyalty, and practicle advice.Dr. Phillips gave a brief background of Aesop (c. 558 BC) who may have been a slave. While little is know of Aesop, he may have been murdered or executed for theft.The Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC) and Greek historian Herodotus (484-425 BC) made brief reference to Aesop. The Ancient Romans also mentioned Aesop and either quoted Aesop or paraphrased him. The Ancient Roman physician Galen (c.129-216 AD)mention the problem of attricution re Aesop's work.Dr. Phillips introduced readers of how Aesop's Fables were preserved during ""the Middle Ages"" when learning was under constant threat. Phillips mentioned several sources of Aesop's fables such as the Florentine Codex (c.1300s) the Moscow Codex, the Dresden Leaf, etc. Those who read this book will have a thorough background of the history of editing and redacting Aesop's work. They will also know the problems in attempting to focus on what sources are reliable.Dr. Phillips divided  Aesop's Fables between those involving animals and those involving men, gods, and objects. The animal most often used in the fables was the fox whose guile and clever assessments make him an example what men are especially when they are trying to ""out-fox"" the naive and enemies.Some of the anecdotes give ""food for thought."" For example, Aeschylus (527-456 B.C.)wrote that Orestes' greatest foe was his conscience when he assassinated his mother who previously assassinated Orestes' father. In other words, ""enemies"" sometimes have outposts in our mind. Dr. Phillips used an anecdote that death can be a relief from life's burdens.As mentioned above, Aesop's work included animals. Dr. Phillips used an anecdote about cattle plotting a revolution against the butchers until an older bovine reminded the plotters that the current skilled butchers whose methods were painless and merciful could be replaced by novices who could make death very painful.The human examples that Dr. Phillips cited dealt with power, relations, and true friendship. Seneca (c.1-66 A.D.)wrote that those with power should use it lightly. Another anecdote stated the kindness and not kinship made bona fide parents. Socrates (c. 470-399 B.C.) was supposedly chided for building a large house to which Socrates responded the hoped he had enough friends to fill it. Cicero (106-43 B.C.) remarked that arms ought to give way to oratory.Other anecdotes and ""words of wisdom"" include a leopard and a fox regarding the leopard's verigated skin and the fox's verigated mind. People run fast to catch something but faster to escape danger. Dr. Phillips included an example of not drinking from an empty well which means people should learn only from the learned. To the wise, nothing is foreign. This comment may in line with St. Thomas Aquinas(1225-1274)who wrote that truth is wherever we find it. Pity those who fear to speak the truth. One anecdote this writer like was that we should love at random but not to be hated needlessly. Necessity is the last and strongest weapon-Livy (59 B.C.- 17 A.D.). Arrogance destroys lovers which can mean that ""coaxing, not ordering, makes love sweet."" A good example of ""the human condition"" is that  fools critisize others but omit their own faults.Dr. Phillips concluded this book with comments of those whose help he graciously acknowledged. The end of the book again cited problems of the historical accuracy of Aesop's work and those whose used his Fables. Those interested in Ancient History can benefit form the bibliography and the list of Ancient Greeks and Romans listed at the end of the book.Dr. Phillips is to be commended for writing and editing a book that is too often ignored in the name of modernity. The undersigned gleaned so much from this book and could write a book itself to include all the proverbs and fables. This book is to be read and digested by thoughtful people.James E.

"Pope Benedict XVI's book titled IN THE BEGINNING... is an collection of four homilies that briefly explain the Catholic view of Creation,""The Fall,"" and restoration. Benedict's homilies provide an allegorical and theological precise of origins and and meaning of existence.Pope Benedict dimissed the notion that some sort of Creation is passe, and modern science has dispensed with ""The meaning of life."" Benedict carefully explained that biblical interpreations are allegorical and have much more deeper meaning than is currently accepted. Benedict made interesting comments about language and thought. For example, ""...God said..."" is an awsome statement that God said what He did and was going to do. Benedict is clear that the ""how"" of Creation is partially explained by mathematics and science and that ""Faith and Science"" are not antagonistic concepts.Benedict developed this theme further by explaining that Catholicism and other religions give meaning to life. The quandry presented by science and technology/science and religion is that science/technology can be a blessing and a curse. Scientific advances have made life easier and longer. Yet, science/technology have developed the capacity of destroying life in a relatively short time. Religious views that people exist as part of God's creation begs the question if science and technology will destroy Creation. The Genesis account stated that people have dominion over the earth but not to destroy it. Since Pope Benedict XVI and Catholicism accept freedom and free will, men have a choice of what to do.The problem is that worship of science and technology make them gods without any reference to an eternal God whose injunctions are basically to enhance life-both physical and spiritual. In other words, ""Life is more than a brilliant interlude between two nothings."" A materialist world view eliminates the wonder and awe of creation. Readers may note that the more people study and explore science, the more they realize they do not know.The study of human existence should be understood that people are created in God's image. One might object that men and women are infused with Original Sin. This simply means that men and women are not as good as they can be. Benedict offered a devestating response to Marxism and other modern ""isms"" in that these ""thinkers"" have a disdain for history because history undermines their theorizing every time. The modern view of ""ultilitarianism"" is risky. According to this view, men are judged by their usefulness. A key question is useful for what. Men can either transcend themselves or remain static and dull. Benedict dealt with the problem of good-and-evil. As depressing as the current trends are, good-and-evil have been replaced with statistics with no regard for convictions or values.Pope Benedict XVI offered a thoughtful response to the above dilemma. Benedict stated that reflection (Confession in the Catholic Church for example)may help us ""to see the error of our ways."" People may see  evil once they are free if it. ""The meaning of life"" is far too complex to be scientically understood. Once men understand that there is the Creator and not themselves, respect for life is in place. Benedict argued that hatred exists either because men are not God or want to be a god.In spite of serious differences, Benedict made the point that most ""thinkers"" accept of ab alio or interdependence. The problem is what men decide on what they should depend. Benedict's solution is that men should thoughtfully depend on  is Ultimate Reality. Otherwise, people fall into the trap of false arrogance which is eventually destructive.Pope Benedict XVI's book is a thoughtful collection of homilies that help readers reflect on the serious questions and problems that have arisen during Modern History. Benedict could have improved this book with comprehensive index and biblography. Yet the book book is worth reading.James E.

"Karl Keating's book titled CATHOLICISM AND FUNDAMENTALISM is a thorough refutation of anti-Catholic bias. Keating undermined the unfounded slurs against the Catholic Church by careful use of documents and history. When anti-Catholic writers try to impress readers with very little knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, Keating effectively showed the shallowness and inaccuracy of such pretense.Keating started his book with a summary of anti-Catholic accusations. Keating examined the claims of that Mary, the Mother of Christ, was not the mother of other children because the Aramaic and Hebrew terms for an extended family were the same as those of the immediate family. Keating's assessment of some, not all, fundamentalists was that they were more intent on condemning Catholics than focusing on their own religion.Keating demolished Loraine Boettner's book titled ROMAN CATHOLICISM. Keating cited numerous errors in the this book re history, misquotations, etc. Keating showed Boettner's book for what it was-unadorned bigotry. In fact, Boettner's book was so badly written that Keating had to rhetorically ask at what point does sloppiness become more than negligence.A misunderstood concept re Catholicism is Papal Infallibility. Keating explained that Papal Infallibility DOES NOT mean perfecton but only applies to morals and faith and not predictability. When anti-Catholic bigots tried to distort Bishop Strossmayer's views for the document of Papal Infallibility in 1870, Keating went to the sources to prove that Bishop Strossmayer accepted the concept which was developed after long and serious debate and discussion. Catholic bashers tried to fabricate Blessed Cardinal Newman's (1801-1890)work re Catholicism which Keating corrected.Other issues that Keating addressed were The Sign of the Cross, Extreme Unction (Last Rites), the presense of icons, and use of languages. Keating used sources that the Sign of the Cross was part of Catholic worship as early as 211 AD. He explained Extreme Unction from the Bible (The Book of James 5:14-15). Keating also was clear that Catholics do not worship icons, but the use of icons are reminders of saints and great men in Church History. Just as people show pictures of loved ones, the icons are reminders of those who did so much work and sacrifice during Church History. Keating easily proved that the Catholic liturgy and Bible were not confined to one language.One of phenomenon of anti-Catholics is that their bias is now big business. Keating showed that some anti-Catholics resort to comic books as though such childishness is a substitute for serious scholarship. One Catholic basher tried to argue without question that Catholics have been told not to think for themselves. Keating dared anyone to find one source where Catholics were told not to think for themselves. In fact, some of the greatest scholars in history have been Catholics.Other exaggerated lies re Catholic History included Jimmy Swaggart's outrageious claim that the Catholic Inquisition claimed 60-95 million victims when Europe's population was c. 50 million. Kennen's book undermines the myths re the Inquistion. Less than one out of every twenty people summoned to an Inquisiton were detained. The few who were detained were mostly freed unharmed. This is not to say that the Inquistion was not used for evil ends. However, Pope Innocent IV *1243-1254)condemned Frederich II (1211-1250) and the latter was later excommunicated. Pope Alexander VI (1492-1503, for all of his alleged sins, condemned the Spanish Inquisition for the same reason.A trend among anti-Catholics is that they threaten to expose what is wrong with Catholicism and Catholics. As Keating noted the same people avoid a public debate at all costs. Keating noted that when false accusations are made against Catholics, intelligent Catholics refute such accusations with ease. History and sources will refute emotional bias every time.Catholic bashers try to condemn Catholics for Catholic tradition. Yet, such views are mentioned in the Bible such as St. Paul's instruction to follow tradition (2 Tim.:3:17 and 2 thess.: 2:15). Early Catholic tradtion may be based on a source called the DIDACHE which was composed between c,50-90 AD). This source has many of the rites and liturgy of Catholicism and is useful for those interested in Early Church History.As mentioned above historical sources are useful to gain a clearer understanding of Church History. Keating emphasized this fact repeatedly and chided Catholic bashers for their lack of historical knowledge and lack of precise thinking. Keating made a good case for the Real Presence during the Eucharist which was an accepted article of faith prior to 100 AD. The Catholic Sacrament of Confession is also confirmed in early Church History and is emphasized in THE DIDACHE. Confession is stated in John 20:22-23. A Protestant pastor was sure this was not biblical until he was shown this passage, and he had enough honesty and class to admit he was previously wrong.Keating's book refutes almost every biased charge against the Catholic Church. Keating does not try to convince non-Catholics to convert, but his book simply informs both Catholics and non-Catholics that the Catholic bashers do not have history, sources, or clear thinking on their side. Keating could have exploited the DIDACHE more to make his case. This book is thorough, well written, and never boring.James E.

"As readers may know, the undersigned reviewed Father Barron's DVD series by the same title of CATHOLICISM. As an aside, this reviewer  reviewed the video series which is recommended. Readers are also encouraged to read the book which is an excellent summary of Catholicism and much of the cultural achievements of Catholics for approximately 2000 years.Father Barron started this book with fact that Christ and His teaching are at the core of the Catholic Faith. He explained Catholicism has been enhanced by martyrs, stained glass, religious and philosphical treatises, great literature, icons, architechture, and great painting. The achievements have not been done to replace Christ but to ""uplift"" thoughtful men and women to something significantly more important than ""the-here-and now."" Father Barron was clear that nature and people are part of God's Creation, and Father Barron did not divorce God from His Creation. Father Barron's view was that Creation is part of the ""grand scheme of things"" which can help to experience God's essence and God's love-love of nature and men and women.The History of Western Civilization is one of achievement as well as tragedy. ""Wars and rumors of war"" have plagued mankind since the beginning civilization. However, Father Barron makes the case for non-violence in the actions of Christ, the early martyrs, Blessed Mother Teresa (1910-1997)and Blessed Pope John Paul II (1978-2005)whose actions helped the faith and undermined Big Communism without firing a shot.Father Barron and other devout Catholics did not claim that they perfectly understood God. Father Barron cited Exodus 6 whereby God said, ""I AM WHO I AM"" which is beyond any definate description. Father Barron also cited St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) who wrote that God is QUI EST (The One Who Is). St. Anselm (1033-1109)used the ontological arguement that God is that which men cannot think of beyond Anything Great. St. Anselm used the Latin phrase ""Si comprehendis, non est Deus"" (If you understand, that is not God). In other words, men cannot define God as a fashion designer, but He Who creates. Father Barron mentioned that while God is beyond any attempt to make a definate definition, people cannot hide from God's Presence.Father Barron added further discourse comparing The One Who Is with pagan deities who were at war with each other as well as with mortals. Father Barron stated that ultimately men and women were God's Creation whom God loves and IS NOT in competition with men. Father Barron unhinged the Manichaeans and Gnostics who argued that Creation was evil and only the spiritual was divine. This view absolved men from character and responsibility contrary to the view that men have free will.Father Barron then discussed the Blessed Virgin Mary (The BVM for the sake of convenience). He compared her to a temple of Christ which protected the Christ Child and was probably closer to Christ than any person which is in part why she is venerated but not an object of adoration. Father Barron reviwed the Marian Apparations re Lourdes, Fatima, etc. Father Baron gave good explations of devotions to Mary and how they embellished the Faith.Father Barron's work  re well known Catholics and saints showed the universality of the Catholic Church. For example, St.  Katherine Drexel (1858-1950)used her considerale inherited wealth to start schools for the maringalized poor in the US. St. Theresa of Liseaux (1873-1897)was a physically weak and unknown nun until her personal STORY of a SOUL was published. St. Edith Stein (1891-1942)was born into an Orthodox Jewish family, converted to the Catholic Faith, became a Carmelite Nun, and was a noted scholar. She was martyred in 1942 because of her Jewish birth. Blessed Mother Theres hardly knew anything of the religious life but became a nun and started a valiant mission of mercy in the worst areas of India. Christopher Dawson(1889-1970), who became an eminent Catholic historian, converted to Catholcism even though his mother was angry because now Dawson ""...would be worshipping with the help."" The Catholic Faith is known on every continent. However, Catholics have assimiliated what they could but rejected what had to be rejected. St. Thomas Aquinas cited Jewish, Greek Orthodox, and Moslem scholarship and made effective use of what embellished his work and politely explained what he rejected. Father Barron made an interesting re the inscription of Christ's Cross which read INRI which translated from the Latin means Jesus King of the Jews. This inscription was also written in Hebrew and Greek, and Pilate may have unknowingly helped to evangelize the Faith. Father Barron mentioned earlier saints such as St. Teresa of Avila (1515-1582) and St. John of the Cross (1542-1591)who were close friends and wrote some of the most sublime Catholic mystical literature.Father Barron erred in his comments about Bruno (1548-1600) and Galileo (1564-1642). Bruno was not executed because of his scientific views. He was tried and convicted as a dangerous revolutionary. This does not mean that Bruno should have been put to death, but a clearer understanding gives more precise history of his problems. Galileo was honored in 1610 by Pope Paul V (1605-1621). Pope Urban VIII (1623-1644)honored Galileo in 1624 with an elaborate celebration to honor Galileo's work in science. However, Galileo was not a very grateful guest and insulted any with whom he disagreed. St. Robert Bellarmine (1542-1621), who remained close friends with Galileo, said he would agree with Galileo's insistence to alter the Bible according to the latter's theories if Galileo could prove his heliocentric views. Galileo COULD NOT prove these views because he could account for parallux given the fact that telescopes were not that good during Galileo's life time. Galileo WAS NEVER held in a dungoeon. During his ""arrest"" and trial, Galileo lived in the Florentine ambassador's residence and then in luxery in the Papal reisidence where he had his own chef. He ate and drank well. His ""sentence"" of restricted travel was a moot point because of poor vision. The ten Cardinals refused to sign the condemnation. In fact, Pope Benedict IV(1740-1758)gave his Imprimatur to ALL OF Galileo's work.Father Barron later sections of the book dealt with modern philosphy and challenges to Catholicism. Father Barron unhinged Marx's (1818-1883)view that religion was ""the opiate of the masses."" What Father Barron emphasized was that the Faith gave meaning and hope to the masses. Father Barron also challenged Sartre's (1905-1980)view that life was absurd. Father Barron cited the inspiration and meaning that the Catholic Faith has taught for 2000 years.One of Father Barron's late sections dealt with Judgement, Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. Father Barron suggested that God does not condemn people to hell. People condemn themselves by  choice because they worship greed, violence, lust, hate, etc. Such poor souls take themselves too seriously and do not reflect on Ultimate Questions and such traits as compassion, forgiveness, mercy. According to Dante (1265-1321), Satan was frozen in hell because of his claim to be God as many now think that wealth, unjust power and cruelty, etc. are gods. Satan is too self absorbed to move. Purgatory, which Father Barron cites 2 Maccabees for biblical support, is developed for those who need to reflect on their wrong doing but are not condemned.In spite of the criticism, this book is solid. Catholic religious directors could use this book for those who want to consider to be received into the Faith and the Catholic Church. The explanations of using art and architecture are very good and can be gleaned by reading Father Barron's book titled HEAVEN IN STONE AND GLASS.December 15 2011(The 220th Anniversay of the Ratification of The Bill of Rights)James E.

"As this reviewer told some friends, he is on a Father Barron Binge. The undersigned does not claim to be the Great Know-It-All, but he recognizes knowledge, clarity of expression, and careful reflection. Father Barron's books appeal to the learned and those not so learned. Only those who are intellectually numb and spiritually dead will not appreciate Father Barron's work.The book titled HEAVEN IN STONE AND GLASS began with a contrast between a dull, boring, and violent world and Medieval world in which men and women were more intensely religious. Contemporary men and women are immune to the physical world. Yet, Medieval people were impressed with religious icons, plants, animals etc. as part of God's Creation. The Medieval Cathedrals were places that told stories and were places of refuge for protection from violence, plague, and other human tragedies. The Cathedrals were places of renewal as well as refuge. Once parishoners left Mass, they were renewed to restore what was wrong. Father Barron alluded to The Virgin as The Mother who offered protection and solace, and the Cathedrals were often dedicated to the Virgin.As readers may know, the icons and stained glass windows told stories of biblical events, parables, lives of the saints, etc. Most parishoners were not literate at least in the Latin language, and readers should note vernacular literature was becoming ""in vogue"" which meant men and women were not completely illiterate. As an aside some of the Medieval vernacualar literature had serious religious overtones.As readers should know, Medieval cathedrals showed vivid colors. Father Barron mentioned that upon entering some of the Medieval cathedrals, parishoners were in darkness which was a contrast from the outside light. This was by design, and Father Barron stated that Catholics were aware of their dark mundane and perhaps evil lives which were dark. Yet, as parishoners and tourists continued their journey, they were gradually introduced to light via the stained glass windows, open areas, etc. The Medieval cathedrals were reminders of a much more glorious ""otherness"" than the here-and-now. Father Barron made mention of the hard work involved in building these magnificent cathedrals. Lords, ladies, ""common"" people, etc. worked together in silence and comaraderie knowing they were involved some sort of sacred work.As noted above, the stained glass windows were part of the religious experience. Father Barron made special mention of the Rose Windows which were arranged in a circle depicting ""the ebb-and-flow"" of life. The Rose Windows showed tragedy and joy with Christ at the center to remind viewers of Ultimate Joy. Father Barron gave a good explanation of the mathematical proportion of the Rose Windows or what Medieval historians called The Sacred Geometry.Father Barron not only described the inside of the Medieval cathedrals, but he carefully decribed what could be called the Cruciformity of the Cathedrals which can only be described from above. The design was arranged as though parisoners and tourists were ""walking through the Cross."" The lesson is that  love of others and Divine Love should be the structure and foundation of our mortal lives.Father Barron's chapter title ""Cosmic Consciousness"" started by a comment that Cathedrals were not designed to make men and women ""feel at home."" Shopping malls, markets, etc. are supposed to fill this function, but Medieval cathedrals were designed to make attendees think they were entering another world-""or a better world"" Men and women were supposed to escape superficial egomania and reflect on a better world. Those who could not do so were trapped by their burdens of false pride, greed, lust, etc. The Medieval cathedrals raised eyes upwards and then beyond the here-and-now. Too many modern men and women have no sense of awareness of stars, sun, etc. They have no awareness of what is beyond the immediate.One of the lessons taught in the Medieval cathedrals was The Last Judgement. Father Barron desribed the windows and icons which taught this lesson and reflected on Christ's admonition in Matthew 25. The west side of Medieval cathedrals showed designs out of proportion because of sin and evil. The east side which faced a rising sun showed light and an ordered Cosmos.As noted above, the icons in cathedrals showed heroes from the Christan Bible (Old and New Testaments) which obviously included the Hebrew Bible or what Jewish people called the TANAK. While some Catholics were anti-Jewish, many of the Hebrew Prophets are honored and dignified by the windows, art, and icons. The pictures of these icons were an indication of the connection between the Old Testament and New Testament which was the intent of the architects and planners of these cathedrals.Father Barron not only wrote about the height and upwards emphasis of Medieval cathedrals, but he had a short but succinct explanation of the crypts. Underground areas were often the ""stuff"" of legends and folklore. All kinds of evil beings inhabited these areas, but  the crypt had another meaning. Father Barron wrote that crypts could be The Virgin's womb and, later, Christ's burial place. In other words, darkness has its place in religious thinking.Neither the Medieval Churchmen nor Father Barron claimed that the cathedrals were replicas of paradise. They were uplifting in that often attention was drawn up to  the sky (both inside and outside of the Medieval Cathedrals). In other words, God was ""something greater.""While the cathedrals were serious reminders of the Faith, they also has their ""comic relief."" Father Barron wrote that the Gargoyles were a reminder that ""the-high-and-mighty"" could be mocked and teased  because  they thought they were important, but they were not above humor and parady. Father Barron showed the Medieval sense of humor which should be a part of life.The cathedrals were a road to Ultimate Truth. Father Barron's depiction of the Maze in Chartre Cathedral is interesting. Pilgrams would follow the small maze in  circular paths which took time. Father Barron's message was that the quickest road was not always the best road to find Christ. This reviewer was impressed that Father Barron could write so profoundly about such a small area in Chartre Cathedral.The section titled Sacred Geometry was facinating. The Medieval Scholastics studied mathematics and geometry to instill the concepts of harmony, balance, reason, etc. The precision of the designs and plans of the Medieval cathedrals was impressively described by Father Barron.Catholicism is a religion that must deal with vices and virtues. These are explained by Medieval artwork. Father Barron explained that the great Scholastic St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) thought  his work as useless UNLESS it encouraged a way of life in line with the Gospel. The vices and virtues are simply rules of life. Father Barron had an excellent explanation of Prudence which is NOT safety and NOT a cowardly attitude of not being involved. Prudence is the virtue that helps men and women decide what is good vs evil, and moral decisions may require careful thought rather cowardly retreat.The Medieval cathedrals were places where the Holy Mass was celebrated. The arrangement of the Medieval cathedrals was condusive to spiritual reflection and focus on the Liturgy and Eucharist. Father Barron briefly but effectively explained the Liturgy which should enhanced a better understanding for those not aware of the Holy Mass or Catholics who take the Holy Mass for granted.The Medieval cathedrals were uplifting and areas of learning. A nun was asked what her response would be to those who claim that Catholic churches are too ornate and not somber. She replied that she could not say via TV what she thought. However, biblical literature is full of color, imagery, etc. For example, The Book of Revelation has very colorful depictions. The icons, art, architecture, etc. are to make men and women more fully aware of the Faith.The undersigned has a few criticisms of the book titled HEAVEN IN STONE AND GLASS. Father Barron should have included an index and a bibliography. He could have made effective use of Henry Adams' book titled MONT SAINT MICHEL AND CHARTRES which is great book re Medieval architecture, literature, and Scholastic Theology. Adams had an excellent chapter in this book re St. Thomas Aquinas, and Father Barron knows so much about Scholastic thought. In spite of these criticisms, Father Barron wrote an excellent book which will only incite this reader to read more of his work.James E.

"Father Barron's book titled THE WORD ON FIRE is an anthology of homilies which are short, clear, and thoughtful. Father Barron's book gives readers much to ponder. While he uses the thinking of St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), Father Barron's writing is not dense. His written expression is readable. Father Barron used Latin, Greek, Hebrew/Aramaic, phrases, but he is not pendantic and not a snob. On the other hand, Father Barron does not over simplify his topics and showed  what a serious scholar can convey to thoughtful men and women.The introduction quickly alerted readers that Christ, His teaching,and His example can be meaningful. Father Barron used the story of the Magi who returned to their homeland by a different route. Father Barron quoted Bishop Fulton Sheen re the Magi when Father Sheen wrote, ""Of course they went back by a different road; no one comes to Christ and ever goes back the same way."" One can rhetorically ask how many saints  changed their lives and helped change other lives because of their turn for the better.The next chapter dealt with what Father Barron called ""God's otherness."" No one can fully grasp God's otherness, but men and woman cannot escape God's closeness as evidenced by the the Adam/Eve story. Father Barron used the story of Isaiah who, when confronted by God and the Seraphim, and Isaiah said he was doomed. St. Peter told Christ to leave him (St. Peter) alone because he was a sinful man. But then both Isaiah and St. Peter ""answered the call""-the Divne Call. St. G.K. Chesterton (1874-1936)noted, a saint is someone who knows he is a sinner.Father Barron then dealt with God's glory. God does not need men's glory, but giving attention to Christ's teaching reflects from God to us. Father Barron's comment re men's vain glory vs. God's glory is cause for reflection. Father Barron refuted Fuerbach's (1804-1872) and Karl Marx's materialism. The pagans had deities who competed against men. God is the Creator who wants men to be better than false humanism and false vanity. Father Barron focused on the fact that the Faith is NOT the opiate of the masses, but the Faith is what gives transcendent hope and character.Not only did Father Barron focus on God's glory and transcendent values, he focused on what may called Divine Love. Father Barron cited Christ's teaching of loving God and loving one's neighbor. When Christ was asked by a clever lawyer who is our neighbor, Christ told the story of the Good Samaritan which was a revolutionary answer given the fact that Jews and Samaritans HATED each other. Father Barron related the story of Rose Hawthorn (1851-1926), the daughter of Nathianiel Hawthron (1804-1862),who lost her father and mother. Rose Hawthorn had some sort of an epiphany, converted to Catholicism, and started a Dominican Order of nuns to care for the less fortunate and poor. Father Barron then mentioned Peter Maurin (1877-1949)who, along with Dorothy Day (1897-1980)who started the Catholic Worker Movement. Both Peter Maurin were devout Catholics who remained devout. They attended Mass as often they could, went to Confession, and accepted Christ's admonition in Matthew 25. Peter Maurin had mental problems which led to forgetfulness. When Dorothy Day was praised for her help to the destitute, she responded that she was not a saint.Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day had faith. Father Barron defined what faith as the door through which we enter the Sacraments, the Liturgy, etc. Great men and women such as Pope John Paul II (1978-2005) and Blessed Mother Teresa (1910-1987)were obviously ""committed"" to the Faith. Faith is what guides men of religion and science. Science and mathematics rely on the faith of natural law, and one can ask who is the Author of Natural Law. As Pope John Paul II once wrote,""Faith without reason leads to superstition. Reason without Revelation leads to chaos.As mentioned above, God is the Author of Natural Law. Christ is king, but He is not a king in the political sense. The Easter Scene of Christ risen is one of shock and surprise to the women and later the diciples. Father Barron obviously regards the Resurrection as key to the Faith and the beginning to the glorious history of the Catholic Church. The resurrection can have both literal and allegorical interpretations. Theologians and philosophers have written so much about this event. The Resurrection can mean that those who are in despair can resurrect their spirits and turn their lives for the better. This is easy to say but hard to do.Father Barron dealt with Christ's compassion and forgiveness. How many despised men and women were restored both physically and spiritually such as the blind, the lame, Mary Magdelen, the Woman at the Well, the women taken in adultry, etc. As readers may note the word Catholic means universal, and the story of Maji and Nativity Scene may illustrate the nature of the Catholic or Universal Church. The Magi were ""pagans"" and probably from Persia. The shepherds were poor and ""unlearned."" Yet, the Nativity showed a Catholic concept. The Catholicism may be represented by the story of the Good Samaritan.Light is often used as a sacred symbol. The stories of Moses and the burning bush, the light that guided Moses and his people from Egypt, etc. make effective use of light guiding religious people. Perhaps the best know example of light is the Transfiguration which is not only the Transfiguration of Christ but a symbol of the fact we can  be transfigure ourselves.Part of the Transfiguration is Divine Love per St. Paul's discourse on love. Father Barron mentioned that we lose our self respect when we resent the success of close friends and loved ones. Such an attitude betrays us when we think of such resentment when we should be joyful for friends and loved ones. Love does not covet, is patient, kind, etc. Father Barron had good insight as to what divine bona fide love is and what it is not.Love can also mean love in the midst of terribly suffering. Father Barron used the example of the ""good thief"" during the Crucifixtion who repented. Even in suffering Christ forgave this man who was probably a political revolutionary, and Christ asked for forgiveness for those who made him suffer and die. Father Kolbe (1894-1941)offered his own life when a fellow inmate was to be executed because of an escape from a concentration camp. Concentration camp conditions can turn inmates againt each other and cause hopeless despair. Yet, Father Kolbe was well grounded in the Faith.An obvious part of the Faith is prayer. Prayer may be due to fear of God. However,as Father Barron wrote, fear can be that of a tyrant. Or fear can be avoiding the reprimend of a kind father such as the Prodigal Son. Prayer can be praise and well as petition. However, we must be careful that what we want may not be good for us. Prayer should not be greedy which means men are not better than beasts. Father wrote about Matthew the tax collector who converted and became a disciple and a saint. St. Peter who recognized Christ as The Son of God was weak and denied Christ three times. However, he was forgiven and became the Rock. The Apostles and early martyrs did not conform to the shifting sands of popular opinion whatever that is worth. Their prayer life helped the early apostles and Chruch Fathers develop the Faith and enhanced their resolve.The Faith is based on the Real Presence of Christ during the Eucharist. The biblical basis for this taken from John 6:48-66. Many who heard Christ's comments about eating His flesh and drinking His blood got angry and left. According to the passage, the audience left before Christ before He finished His discourse which ended with the comment,""It is the spirit that gives life."" Father Barron gave an excellent explation that ""The Word (Logos) became flesh..."" Father Barron wrote that Creation and other events were based on what God said... and then the result took place. The Word became flesh.Another section of Father Barron's book dealt with the role of the Catholic priest, the Rite, and people. The Holy Mass must work in harmony without any of the three components exercising more authority than necessary. Father Barron compared the Holy Mass to a Classical Music performance which is based on balance to enjoy the beauty of the performance.The concluding sections of the book had interesing comments on ""family values"" (a phrase that has been so badly corrupted), the authenic meaning of Catholcism, truth, and understanding. Father Barron used the examples of Hannah who, after begging God for a son, gave her son Samuel to Eli to be a Nazarite which is similar to a monk. The Virgin Mary gave her Son to God. The point is that parents should not try to live their lives via that children. How often have children been abused because they were not star athletes or did not marry someone who would give the parents phony prestige. In other words, parents should know that a holy life of their children is much more important than false vanity and shallow prestige.Readers have often heard of the expression that someone should be a good Catholic. What does this mean? Father Barron did not prescribe rebellion against a political system. What he did recommend is that Catholics should assimilate what they can and reject what they must. In other words, Catholics can be good Americans, but they must remember that they are Catholics first. Being a good Catholic can be exemplified by example and action. Yet, being a good Catholic means taking the Sacraments, the Holy Mass, etc. seriously as a means of renewal and refelction  which may help people to act in an effective way rather than in wreckless way. This may include a refutation of unjust and even murderous demands of political power. However, wreckless action can lead to worse situations.The last section of the book defined Ephphata or to be open. Father Barron stated that often when God appeared to men, such appearances occured in quiet settings far from noise and cacophonous crowds and dins of nonsense. Father Barron gave examples that when Christ cured people of blindness or deafness, He took them to a quiet place away from useless noise. The lesson may well be the separation of the sacred from the profane.Father Barron's book is based on careful thinking, knowledge, and insight. Readers with, ""residual common sense"" can benefit from this book. This book is useful for Catholics, but non-Catholics can also benefit from this book. This book is highly recommended.James E.

"Father Thomas Merton (1915-1968)converted to Catholicism in 1938, was rejected by the Franciscans for an unsavory past, and became a Trappist monk. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1949 and became a prolific writer whose work appealed to both Catholics and non-Catholics. His work showed men and women who they are and who they should be. The book titled ADVENT AND CHRISTMAS WITH THOMAS MERTON was published by the Redemptorists in 2002, and is a timely book of contemplation especially during the Catholic season of Advent and Christmas.Advent can mean beginning or coming such as the arrival of Christmas. Father Merton argued that Christ can come to us at birth, impression, death, and judgement. Merton thought we should be awake to spiritual renewal as soon and as often as possible to understand  what is crucial before it is too late. In other words, we should reject what is false and learn what is ultimately true and inspired. Father Merton thought evil, stupid men and women were not quite able to destroy civilization because just enough thoughtful spiritual men have existed to halt such destruction-for the time being.Father Merton viewed Advent as ""Sacrament"" or the Real Presence of God. Father Merton thought the Real Presence was for contemporary times and not to be postponed which Father Merton thought made men and women dull and apathetic. Father Merton was emphatic that we should  show light and joy as opposed to dull apathy.Father Merton's Advent and Christmas prayers and reflection dealt with The Virgin's answer ""yes"" during the Announciation, and readers can read that the Virgin was filled with joy which she shared with Elizabeth and others during the Nativity. Father Merton used this example as what men and women should aspire to after reading and reflection. Men and women should radiate bona fide love and avoid useless noise. Father Merton mentioned the Catholic Church bells are reminders of peace as opposed to stupidity and violence.Father Merton's Advent reflections are clear that biblial literature, The Sacraments, etc. do not annihilate us but help us to be much better people. We should become someone else, and Father Merton stated that Advent was a good time to become a monk or nun if one had accepted such a vocation. Father Merton wrote that Advent is a time for hope-bona fide hope and not false hopes. Meekness, sadness, etc. do not necessarily mean despair. Advent and what it signifies can lead men and women to be more resolute.Again, Father Merton wanted men and women should focus on ""Ultimate Values"" and escape from a depressing ""here-and-now."" Men and women should know the difference between truth and power. Power vanishes, but truth is lasting. This means that examination of conscience is necessary.Father Merton's book has excerpts from biblical literature, his own work, and prayers. The book has suggested formats and suggested prayers and readings to help men and women find Advent more meaningful. Given the aggrevated  assault-and-battary and murder during  mindless anger during the Christmas shopping sprees, Father Merton's book is a reminder of what Advent is, and what it is not.James E.

"Sister Margherita Marchione wrote yet another book defending the honor of Pope Pius XII (PPXII for the sake of convenience). Sister Marchione was reluctant to have this book published, but this reviewer is so glad she agree to have the book published. Per usual, she did a thorough job of research and wrote one more book about a great PopeSome of the newer sources that Sister Marchione used date from the 1930s even before PPXII was elected Pope. For example,THE PALESTINE POST dated September 13, 1933 had high praise for Pope Pius XI's Concordot with the Hitler regime. This document was written with the help of Eugenio Pacelli, the future PPXII, and the document is clear that the Vatican officials DEMANDED that Jewish people be treated with decency and respect. Later in the years of 1943-1944, PPXII bluntly told German authorities he was not the least intimidated by German authorities when the Mussolini regime was disintegrating, and the Germans were taking control in Italy including Rome, Italy.The book then dealt with PPXII's learning and immense knowledge. PPXII was knowledgeable re Sir Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin. PPXII was familiar with Marconi's work in wireless radio, and Vatican officials were quick to use the radio to preach and encourage men and women during the dark days of W.W. II. Sister Marchione mentioned that PPXII knew of the atomic physics. PPXII was one of the few who predicted both the benfits and terrible potential for destruction re atomic physics.Praise for the Vatican and PPXII continued in the early 1940s. Following Pope Pius XI's announcing MIT BRENNENDER SORGE (March 14,1937)other official sources and comments from those who alive in the 1930s-1940s further embellished the Catholic Church's fierce opposition to the Hitler regime as well as that of Stalin. Readers may know that MIT BRENNENDER SORGE was announced by Pope Pius XI but was written by Eugenio Pacelli-the future Pope Pius XII. This document was a scathing denounciation of racism, anti-Semiticism, etc. In fact the document was clear the those of the Jewish religion were spiritual Semites of Catholics. Dr. Joseph Lichten, who was Jewish, had praise for PPXII. The 1/23/1940 edition of THE NEW YORK TIMES had high praise for PPXII. Sister Marchione cited Rabbi Lazaron, who, in 1943, had high praise for PPXII and Vatican officials.As Sister Marchione and others mentioned, PPXII had to be very careful. When PPXII had Dutch Catholic Bishops read a severe letter condemning German perecution to their congregations, St. Edith Stein, a Carmelite Nun born into a Jewish family,was arrested and was eventually put to death.Yet, PPXII outsmarted the German authorities. The Jewish family named Mendes confired that PPXII helped them and other Jewish people to escape from German controlled Europe. Clara Coen-Capon was saved by getting help from the Catholic Teaching Order called The Religious Teachers Filipini in Novemeber of 1943. The Vatican officials condemned Hitler's National Socialism as National Terrorism. Many European Jewish people both in Western and Eastern Europe gave tesiimony of the courage of Vatican officials and PPXII. Readers should note that Vatican officials WERE THE FIRST TO PROTEST PERSECUTION OF JEWS AND OTHERS. Albert Einstein who was obviously not Catholic reported this fact in a TIME mongraphy dated December 23, 1940 (pages 38-41).Not only doVactican archieves vindicate PPXII, but non Catholic sources do was well. Jay Pierrpoint Moffat who led the US State Department's European Division in 1939 bluntly stated that during the 1930s, PPXII considered Hitler and his regime as evil. Moffat reported in April of 2003 that PPXII clearly informed Catholics including secular clergy and religious to save as many refugees including Jews as possible. Gold Meir had unreserved high praise for PPXII which she articulated in 1958. The CIA sources dated from 1941-1947 further confirm PPXII's compassion and courage and compassion. The PALESTINE POST(March 6,1939), THE CANADIAN JEWISH CHRONICAL (March 10,1939), and the LONDON ZIONIST REVIEW (March 16,1939)gave high praise to PPXII. Katz J. Duner of Pennsylvania had complimentary remarks about the Catholic Church and PPXII. The list of non Catholics and Jewish people who were alive during PPXII' tenure is almost endless.Sigrid Ruedel Crane compared the high praise PPXII of those who knew PPXII and were alive during his pontificate with the contemporary cowards (now) who use media nonsense and smear to defame PPXII. We should note that almost endless testimonies, overwhelming documents (Catholic and non-Catholic)vindicate Pope Pius XII. Even Eichmann's sources and oral statements support the courage of PPXII.The undersigned could not resist the temptation to favorably review a good book about a great man-Pope Pius XII. This book has the advantage of citing yet more recently discovered sources to sustain the honorable reputation of Pope Pius XII.James E.

"As the undersigned mentioned in other reviews, he does not view visual media very often and rarely writes favorably of video presentations. Yet, the video series title CATHOLICISM produced by Father Roger Barron facinated and impressed this reviewer. Father Barron  effectively articulates Catholicism with lectures and vivid scenes from shrines and Catholic Churches throughout the world.Father Barron began this series with an explantion of the early history of the Catholic Church. He explained the Greek language origins of the word Catholic which meant universal and still does given the international nature of the Catholic Church. Father Barron explained why Rome became the center of the international Catholic Church. He informed readers that St. Peter and St. Paul were martyred in Rome as were many of the early Catholic saints.One point that Father Barron emphasized was that the unity of the Catholic Church is not based on a ""totalitarian"" system of control but on a unique inclusiveness that accepted what benefitted the Faith and rejected what was harmful. For example, Father Barron mentioned the usefulness of Ancient Greek philosophy such as Plato (427-247 BC) and Aristole(384-322 BC) whose work was often cited by early Christians such as St. Augustine (354-430 AD). Readers may know the outstanding work St. Aquinas (1225-1274)who utilized Aristotle' emphasis on reason to enshrine the Catholic Faith.Father Barron did not avoid discussing other religions. Like St. Thomas Aquinas, Father Baron briefly discusses Hinduism, Islam, etc. He gave due respect to their  religious concepts. He made an interesting remark when he stated that we needed a good religious arguement which is now seriously lacking. Most ""religious"" commentary is shouting, ad hominem stupidity, and self posturing. Yet, historically many fameous Catholics have actively engaged those of different religious views. For example, St. Francis of Assisi (1170-1226)went into Moslem military camps to convert and evangelize. He was not very successful, but militant Moslems respected St. Francis so much that they welcomed him and NEVER threatened him. How St. Francis was able to do this is beyond the comprehension of the this reviewer.Father Barron then discussed the diversity of the saints who were very different. St. Thomas Aquinas was scholarly and a superb intellectual. On the other hand, St. Francis of Assisi was not intellectual at all, but he showed considerable compassion and mercy. To refute the false notion that Catholics oppress women, Father Barron cited for modern women who became saints. St. Therese(1873-1888)lived to be only 24 and was hardly known until her work was read and published. St. Katherine Drexel (1858-1953) was born into wealth and used her inheritance to help teach poor blacks and indians. St Edith Stein (1891-1942)was born into an Orthodox Jewish family and, during a time of spiritual darkness, converted to Catholicism, joined a Carmelite Order, and was a first-rate scholar. She died in a concentration camp. Blessed Mother Teresa (1910-1997)knew little of nuns, but she became a nun and followed Chrit's teaching to help the poor, the very poorest in India, and was tough enough make her order work and successful. Father Baron's pictural presentations gave viewers a graphic description of how important these women were.Father Barron effectively used visuals and reason to explain the ""Last Things"" which are death, judgement, heaven, hell, and purgatory. Father Barrron used Dante's (1265-1321)THE DIVINE COMEDY to explain hell. Father Baron argued that self absorbtion and self gratification lead to a ""fall"" and placed Satan at the bottom of hell frozen in time and so depressed he did not notice his visitors. Father Baron paraphrased G.K. Chesterton (1874-1936)who said the angles and saints went up because they took themselves lightly and were not self absorbed. When Father Barron discussed purgatotry, he showed a video of an Irish island where penitents undergo ordeals of walking without shoes and engage in constant prayer for reflection.Father Barron's commentary on Paradise is very thoughtful. He is clear that we can know and learn so much about the material world via science. However, he uses the ontoligical arguement to justify a belief beyobnd the material world. His explanation of the Rose Window in the Notre Dame Cathedral was interesting. He explained the symbolism of the Rose Window and how its exquisite beauty led viewers to a realization of something more impressive.Father Barron not only effectively used visuals and clear lecturing to entice readers to careful thought and reflection, he also cited fameous Catholic intellectuals and briefly but effectively explained their concepts. Father Barron showed he was versatile re languages with clear explanations of Latin and Greek phrases that have been important to Catholic history and theology. In other words, language and thought have been important to the Catholic history.Again, this reviewer rarely views let along recommends videos. However, this presentation was well done and can appeal to religious, lay men and women, non-Catholics and anyone who appreciates beauty and intellectual stimulation.James E.

"Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman (1820-1891)commented that after seeing the terrible carnage and death on the battlefields during the Chattanooga Campaign,that anyone who glorified war was insane. Ellen La Motte (1873-1961) was an American nurse who volunteered to help the wounded French during World War I. Her book titled THE BACKWASH OF WAR is a collection of anecdotes of her experiences which haunted her for the rest of her life. This book is a grim reminder that for all the ""uplifting"" glory of war, such propaganda is belied by the intense suffering and untimely death of young men.La Motte gave a detailed account of the crass/crude attitudes of many of the seriously wounded patients she treated. She vividly described the filth, despair, and lack of decency in the midst of terrible suffering and agonizing death. She explained of the stupidity of one wounded patient who tried to commit suicide. The commanders insisted that the poor soul who tried to take his life recover so that he could be ""honorably"" shot by a firing squad. La Motte commented on the stupidity of such contradictory actions.La Motte then made interesing comments about the attitude of the seriously wounded were disrepected who became a burden to others and to themselves. Such men were considered as an economic and social liability by those who wanted the war to continue but did not dare get close to a battlefield. La Motte made an interesing anecdote about an air ""hero"" who was decorated and then died when he flew a plane while intoxicated. La Motte rhetorically asked if war were about glory or Mammon. Another way of making this point was La Motte's reflection that the idealists glorify war for which  the mass of men fight and die, but the idealists will not do themselves.La Motte gave anecdotes of men she remembered. Marius suffered ten hours on the battlefield before he was taken to a medical facilty. Marius knew he had gangrene and was going to die and critisized the medical personel for exposure to war only to write books and memoirs. Those who had amputations were often given The Croix de Guerre and then released to life of scorn and helplessness. Such conditions obviously strained the orderlies and other medical staff who vented their frustrations against the ungrateful patients who were in agony. La Motte complimented the Catholic clery and religious nuns who tried to do the best they could.The British were harshly critisized in this atmosphere of suffering. La Motte made critical remarks of the British of dumping a small child on the French because of convenience when the British had their own medical facilities. According to the British military mentality, civilians were cheaper and a nuisance. Based on the hideousness of the war, all life was cheap, and such agony and death made some of the medical staff calloused and immune to their environment.La Motte also made careful note of the men in the Bataillon de Afrique. These men were convicts who were conscripted into this battalion as legal penalities. They were called the Apache and usually could not be awarded any military awards due to their convict status. Some of these men were conscripted for what could be petty crimes such as petty theft and fights over girlfriends.La Motte was aware of those who wanted the war to continue but were safe from its dangers. When journalists wrote about another advance, such nonsense simply meant another array of agony and death. Death and suffering were simply replaced by more death and suffering. What concerned La Motte were not the facts of life and death but the intervals which meant terrible suffering on battlefields with little compassion and concern.Another amusingly stupid policy consisted of orders that wives could not meet their husbands during lulls in the battlefield carnage but other single women could. The obvious temptations were ignored by supposedly intelligent politicians (there is no such thing) and military officers. Perhaps wives would complain about the actual destruction of war which belied all the phony glory and lying about war.Once the young men were depleted by conscription, older men were conscripted into combat and died just as painfully and miserably. Some of the officers complained that they had to go to the front to issue military awards. They offered such military medals with such indifference that they appeared totally unconcerned what war does to men-young and old.If war made military men uncivilized, the effects were the same on some civilians. La Motte revealed a story of a mother who complained that she was asked to go to a military hospital to accompany her young dying son. The mother and her husband were making so much money from troops that a dying child interfered with a booming business. According to La Motte, the war did much to eliminate compassion, mercy, kindness, responsibility, etc. It always does.One particular story that La Motte conveyed was that of Antoine who was a cosmotologist. Antoine was not worried about his young son's conscription because the French believed that W.W. I would last at most two months. It lasted much longer, and Antoine's son was conscripted only to be horribly wounded and maimed. He lost his face, limbs, etc. Antoine was assured that advanced surgery restored his son. However, when Antoine saw his son, the poor soul(the son) lost limbs, was blind, and a human wreck. Antoine's son could only say, ""Kill me Papa."" Antoine could not because he was ""civilized"" when taking his son's life would have been an act of mercy.Another depressing anecdote consisted of older soldier named Gramment who was seriously wounded. His surgeon did work that gave Gramment a 1/10,000 chance of survival. Yet, the surgeon prolonged Gramment's life only to hope for a glorious reputation as a surgeon. Gramment knew he was a guinea pig and patiently suffered a prolonged life of agony when all concerned knew he would and should die without such an ordealLa Motte concluded the book with a sad tale about a young lad who was stomped by a horse carrying a carriage of a military commander. The commander was angry at the inconvenience and did not care at all about the little fellow. The officer betrayed his status of an officer and a gentleman with such a hateful calloused attitude.This book is a sobering reminder of the actual ""Backwash of War."" When armchair patriots and those who want war but do not fight war, the book is a clear, vividly descriptive analysis of the actual results of war. When war mongers and arm chair patriots extol about what is done to the enemy, whomever that may be at any given instant, readers should read this book and discover what war does to us-winners and losers.James E.

"Father Stanley Jaki, OSB, (1924-2009) was a well known physicist and astronomer during the 20th. and 21st.centuries. He taught and lectured in European and U.S. univerities. He also demonstrated knowledge of history, philosophy, theology, etc. In his book titled THE SAVORIOR OF SCIENCE, Father Jaki demonstrated that popular notions of science  and religion were  myths based on lack of historical knowledge, popular misconceptions,scientific confusion, and greed which muted intelligent debate re religion, science, and philosophy.Father Jaki showed insight re the comments of scientists who claimed no moral guidance re their work. Father Jaki contrasted this superficial attitude with the science that led to machine guns, poison gas, more destructive artillery, and mass carage during W.W. I. This was followed by concentration camp brutality, flying fortresses, the obliteration of cities, and the atomic bomb. The atomic bomb was followed thermonuclear weapons. In other words, those members of the scientific community had to be aware that what they did could not only improve living standards but also destroy every man, woman, and child on the planet. This view was not idle talk but possible tragic reality. Father Jaki reminded readers of what can occur when religious convictions are muted, and material greed is honored in place of compassion, kindness, careful thought, and wisdom. In other words, where can our ""progress"" lead us?Father then gave a brief history of non-European peoples and why they did not have the advances of Western Civiliztion. Father Jaki was honest enough to credit non-Europeans  for their achievements and that such achievements embellished Western Civilization. However, as much as the Ancient Egyptions achieved re architecture and irrigation, their obsession with animal worship and death halted their concept of transcendence. Father Jaki credited the Ancient Hindus with creating the decimal system and other advances. However, Jaki argued that the Hindu and Buddhist view of a cyclical cosmos stunted their civilizations, and one can think of the Caste System. Father Jaki credited the Moslems with the development of Arabic numbers, geometry, algerbra, and medicine. Yet,some Moslems could not delve into a clear concept of cause-and-effect because of a ""conservative"" rigorous interpretation of the KORAN. Again, Father Jaki was honest enough to also explain that, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity had some common characteristics.Father Jaki then focused on the Catholic Faith, the Cosmos, time. He explained that the Ancient Hebrews has a grand view of the Cosmos, but these people understood that God was the Creator of the Cosmos and not the Cosmos. In other words, the Cosmos is a wonder but not  God. Father Jaki showed his familiarity with the Old Testament and New Testament and cited several passages re God, the Cosmos, and man as created in God's image. According to Father Jaki, God is the First Cause. Father Jaki was no pantheist and showed that pantheism as an abondonment of good vs. evil and moral responsibility. God is not a refill but is a priori to everything that exists. He mention Cardinal John Newman (1801-1890)who wrote in Newman'sbook THE IDEA OF A UNIVERSITY that the only thought greater than the universe is the Creator of the universe.Father Jaki then wrote about Revelation and Reason. Obviously, Jaki knew that Aristarchus (310-250 BC), Kepler (1571-1630), and even Galileo (1564-1642) could not be as accurate as modern astronomers given their lack of good telescopes which were centuries in the future. Father Jaki severely critisized Kant (1724-1804)when Kant stated that the universe was not real but only a metaphysical concept. One of the problems Kant and later ""philosophers"" is that they thought they had ""the final answer"" which exluded transcendence-and hope.Albert Einstein (1879-1955)was able to admit that there are universal laws. When Father LeMaitre (1894-1966), S.J.,did mathematical work re an expanding universe, Einstein was gracious enough to give Father LeMaitre credit in spite of superficial religious differences.During much of the 20th. and early 21st. centuries, many populizers of science tried to substitute wild imaginations for careful scienctific thought. The vain attempt to find life outside of our planet have been fruitless, and the idea of sending a space vehicle which  will reach something in about 10,000 years is fruitless. Jaki commented on what Purcell called the stuff of cereal boxes and comic books. Yet, men are immune from the complexity of life on earth from insects to the complex systems of men and women. To quote Rabelais (c. 1483-c.1559)""Science without conseicens if but the soul's decadence."" This quote well defines the concerns Father Jaki presented in this book.Obviously Father Jaki had to confront the concept of creation science and Darwinism. Those in both camps were severely critisized by Father Jaki. Jaki critisized the advocates of creation science because of their attempts to measure God-or reduce God to their own pettiness. Father Jaki critisized William Jennings Bryan (1865-1925)during the Scopes' trial in 1925. Bryan wasted his oratorial ability in trying to state a time table for the Creation and that the creation scientists try to reduce God to a fashion designer. Father Jaki also condemned the Darwinists because of their claims of absolute truth in spite of new discoveries. The Darwinists lost all of their sense of wonder and awe which makes for a dull view.The final section of the book dealt with men and their immortal souls which should be well beyond any government no matter how gradiose the political leaders may claim to be. Men are not political puppets to enshrine some political system which caters to a materialist greedy world that has no moral purpose or direction.Father Jaki demonstrated considerable knowledge of physics, astronomy, biology, and other scientific disciplines. He also showed a good grasp of historical knowledge. One reviewer said Father Jaki could not think. Actually, Father Jaki could think as proven by his contributions to physics. Another reviewer argued that Father Jaki was too irritable. This may be true, but such irritability can draw readers' attention. Basically Father Jaki argued that knowledge can lead to thought and thought can lead to more knowledge. Father Jaki wrote that knowledge should have purpose and wisdom as ultimate goals.James E.

"The Penguin edition of THE CITY OF GOD by St. Augustine (354-430)is comprehensive and well organized. G.R. Evans did a good job in writing the introduction which gives a good guide to follow the complex text and history which St. Augustine alludes to in this book. This a thoughtful book which requires time and reflection.Marcellinus (martyred in 413) asked St. Augustine to respond to the pagan arguement that the Catholic Faith was the reason for the disintegration of the Roman Empire. Augustine began this book in 412 and did not finish it until 426 four years before he died. St. Augustine refuted the pagan arguement effectively. He stated that the seeds of Roman demise were in place well before the collapse in the fourth (300s) and fifth (400s) centuries. St. Augustine cited the greed, lust, political assassinations, dishonesty, etc. that the Roman authorities practiced centuries earlier. In spite of impending doom, Augustine noted that when the Romans needed unity and resolve, they were blind to the disasters and continued their evil ways which led to their political disintegration. In other words Roman evil prvailed, and the Romans greed and lust for power blinded them to their imminent danger.Part of the demise occured when Aleric's forces sacked and looted the city of Rome in 410 AD. What angered St. Augustine was the fact that many Roman citizens took refuge in Catholic sanctuaries to avoid rape, murder, slavery, etc. Aleric's forces honored these Catholic sanctuaries which helped save many from murder and physical abuse. Yet, many of those who claimed to be Catholic and took sanctuary, later condemned Catholic authorities and those who helped save them. St. Augustine reminded the Romans that if they had adhered to the values of honor, virtue, honesty, etc. of the early Roman Republic, they would have avoided the disasters that occured. Augustine also cited some of the early virtues which were similar to those of Catholcism.St. Augustine also saw an opportunity to critisize Roman paganism. He cited chapter-and-verse the contradictions of the pagan dieties who were fickle and inconsistent. St. Augustine cited the use of men to protect pagan icons who were supposed to protect the Romans. Yet, these deities, who were supposedly so powerful, need mortal men to protect them. Then Augustine rhetorically asked what good these pagan gods were amidst the collapse of the Roman Empire.Augustine also attacked the pagan concept of fate. Augustine wrote that men's ability to reason led to cause-and effect relations which had nothing to do with fate. He also mentioned the God was consistent and an ordered universe was the only thing worth bona fide thought. God predestined the natural order, but men could make choices which led to good or evil (The City of God or the City of Man). The City of Man could lead to salvation or disaster. Augustine thought that materialsim and evil means and ends would destroy empires and once powerful leaders. The City of God was one of honesty, compassion, foreiveness, etc.Obviously, St. Augustine did not agree with many schools of philosphy because they were so contradictory. Augustine thought philosophy and learning should lead to truth and not incosistent concepts. For example, the Stoics claimed that emotions should be eliminated. Yet, Augustine cited a Stoic who expressed fear during a sea storm. In other words, emotions are real and must be controlled but cannot be eliminated.While St. Augustine refuted many prevailing schools of thought, he respected Aristotle (384-322 BC) and Plato (427-347 BC). Augustine did not condemn these two Greek philosophers for their paganism because they did not have access to the Old Testament. Augustine praised these two men for an attempt to arrive at truth and Ultimate Values. In other words, St. Augustine did not divorce himself from history and philosophy and knew that the Catholic Church was in this world but not of this world.From the above, Augustine was not a polytheist. He wrote that Ultimate Truth should be man's quest and not material greed. Material greed vanishes, but Ultimate Truth is enduring and should be part of The City of God. Men should reflect on their character and what is important-The City of God or The City of Man. St. Augustine disagreed with the Manichaeans who thought the physical world was evil created by an evil God of the Old Testament. Augustine contradicted this concept with fact that nature, the Cosmos, and men were part of God's creation, and nature was inherently good. However, evil men made evil uses of nature to their own demise.Can evil men change for the better? St. Augustine wrote that they can as part of God's grace and forgiveness. Men can improve their character if they are sincere. In other words, men are not as good as they can be, but an honest effort can lead men to better character and lives. Given Augustine's concept of God as Creator, Augustine accepted the concept of Ex Nihilio or Creation out of Nothing. St. Augustine was honest enough to admit that he could not fully explain this concept. Augustine was also honest enough to admit no-one could accurately determine the age of the earth or Cosmos.Another aspect of St. Augustine's book (about two pages), was his opposition to war. God wanted peace and harmony, and war was obviously an affront to peace and harmony. Augustine grudgingly accept the concept of the ""just war"" (just war?), but he expressed skepticism whereby abuse of this concept could be used as a pretext for war and loot.Men who aspire to The City of God must be willingly to admit their own responsibility for their sins and evil deeds. Augustine's comments on the Adam-and Eve story were that they recognized sin, but they were only too willing to blame others. Augustine thought the blame-game was counter productive and precluded an honest willingness to seek forgiveness and improve one's self respect. St. Augustine did not limit The City of God to Romans, and wrote that men of different races, languages, etc. could be approached to achieve The City of God.St. Augustine gave examples of men who built cities for political power and material gain. Cain built a city. Augustine referred to the Assyrian city of Ninevah, Babylon, etc. whose leaders tried to build empires only to evenutally face destruction. Rome was the most obvious example during Augustine's life time. The City of Man can crush men's physical well being and their spirit. The City of God can lift men's spirit.Augustine knew that men were both secular and spiritual beings. He did not disparage reason as long as it was combined with revelation. Or, as the late Pope John Paul II wrote,""Reason without revelation leads to chaos. Revelation without reason leads to supersition."" Augustine was clear in his opposition to magic and superstition.St. Augustine was no shallow idealist. He knew suffering and evil could effect good people, but serene patience and the Faith made such suffering bearable. The early martyrs were so convinced of the Catholic Faith that they joyfully faced torture and death with joy and calm resolve.Did St. Augustine do his job? The answer is yes, and St. Augustine was thorough. St. Augustine was aware that his work was not above criticism and that there would be disagreement. He did not object to HONEST debate which can lead to learning and truth. Augustine was not an intellectual snob, but he was confident if only because he was sincere.The undersigned recommends this book to thoughtful readers with the advice that the book requires time, effort, and careful reflection. Men and women who are not Catholic or even religious will benefit from the book because St. Augustine wrote about so many issues re the meaning of life. Readers will also be impressed with Augustine's knowledge of the Bible and Ancient History. Any thoughtful person can benefit from this book.James E.

"JOB AND THE EXCESS OF EVIL was written by Philippe Nemo and in 1978 and was published by Duquesne University Press in English translation in 1998. As this reviewer titled this review, this a powerful but depressing book. Nemo posed more questions than possible answers, and this well written book requires patience and careful thought.Nemo early section of this book dealt with authorship and questions why The Book of Job became part of the Jewish and Catholic Canon. Some biblical scholars argue that The Book of Job was of Persian origin. Others suggest That the Ancient Hebrews may have edited and redacted this epic poem.A brief summary of the Book of Job may help refresh readers' memories and explain Nemo's thoughtful book. Job is the subject of a ""bet"" between God and Satan whereby Satan told God that Job would curse God if Job lost all that he had including good health. Satan is not so much an evil doer but is God's ""trouble shooter."" Job loses his flocks, children, and eventually personally suffers such terrible health afflictions that his wife and ""friends"" are loath to even look at him. Job is physically and spiritually isolated and is confronted by three ""friends""-Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. Nemo basically dealt with extreme personal tragedy and not polictial purges. The latter supposedly require political solutions which are no better cure than the evil that was eliminated . Nemo dealt with personal tragedy and  not political statistics. Yet, those who suffer from political purges are individuals who are more than statistics.Job answered his ""friends"" by reminding them that evil men prosper while good men suffer often at the expense of evil men. When told that evil men's heirs suffer later, Job answered what do these evil men care once they are dead and gone. In other words, life is not ideal and justice does not always prevail. When Job's friends argue that Job must have sinned and Job should admit it, Job justfiably refuses. According to Nemo and Job's ""friends,"" Job is accused of insolence. Job knew better and said so.Job's ""friends"" have a mechanistic view of God and the Law that is unsatisfactory. Job knew very well that the world is not ideal and not an Utopia, and Nemo made a forceful case for Job and an imperfect world which only satifies those who have what Bonhoffer called ""cheap grace.""Nemo made a good case of Job's anxiety. Job suffers pain during the day and suffers terror at night and has no relief. His ""friends"" are annoying but at least someone with whom he can debate and make his case. When the suggestion is made that Job make a ""plea bargain"" with his friends and God, Job rebuts such nonsense. Job knows very well that he is innocent.Nemo wrote a good case that The Book of Job is about existence and the problem of evil. Nemo cites Heidegger (1889-1976) who argued that the basic question of life was Being and Nothinness. Job is confronted with Being and unbearable suffering, and Job argued that he would have been better if he had not been born or had died in infancy. Given his plight and constant suffering, Job preferred death.In spite of his ""friends"" nagging and poor arguements, Job DEMANDS a trial with God. Job gets his hearing before God beginning in chapter 38. Job is vindicated and Job's ""friends"" are rebuked. Job submits too easily to God's remarks. The transcendence of God is little consolation to Job. To paraphrase Virginia Woolf (1882-1941), she read the Book of Job and God did not do well. One Rabbi argued that Job let God go too easily. The conclusion of the Book of Job does not explain very much. Job has his wealth and health restored and has more children. However, who can say that Job's later children were fair compensation for his children who died.Nemo ended this book with concept of transcendence. The efforts of good men who died were later vindicated by events and belated recognition. The only way we can cope with unjustified suffering is faith in the future because we cannot change the past. The historical record is one of flux,and faith may help with what Nemo called the Via Dolorosa.Nemo's book is depressing but thoughtful. Reflective men and women can learn much from this book even though Nemo nor the author(s)of the Book of Job claim to have the final answer. What Nemo achieved is serious thought and contemplation. This is a good book for philosophy classes, theology classes, etc.James E.

"This machine is awesome! It's so simple to use, the parts are super easy to clean and I love how many functions it has. I wasn't in the market to buy a full-blown food processor or mixer because of the cost - this is a GREAT alternative! Whisking, chopping and blending is a breeze! I love how compact it is, which makes it easy to store in a small kitchen like mine. It saves me so much time when meal prepping for the week.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX63OCS7JO7BM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKRK2KC#wasThisHelpful","RX63OCS7JO7BM","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is cute little book with the protagonist being a third grade girl in first person. Having a third grade son myself, I can honestly say that the writing is at first extremely scatter brained and happy-go-lucky and exactly how a third grader thinks and acts. The sheer joy of life and lack of awareness of bad stuff in the world is accurately captured. While the book is probably more geared toward little girls, I think the theme of the story should be enjoyed by all kids alike.The book is about a few days in the life of Agnes; a third grade Secret Knock Club member who is ultra-excited about having a kindergarten buddy. This is all sweet and good and gives Agnes character, but the heart of the story centers around a lesson for kids to take initiative to do community service; to do things to improve their surrounds. It's a good lesson for kids at a good time to be aware and to be doers instead of viewers.There is a great lesson to be learned in this book but the lesson learned is way too in your face and not at all disguised. As we're marching around through Agnes' life, suddenly she just decides to weed and compost a neglected courtyard at her school and then she proceeds to guide everybody else into how you would organize such a thing. I do enjoy children's books that teach a lesson, but instead of believing that this third grader took this initiative, I could only think the writer had an agenda and didn't tactfully walk into this agenda one bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSC6QPCPID4GW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477847928#wasThisHelpful","RSC6QPCPID4GW","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What's not to love here? A few things to make note of though; this projector does not do sound, so you'll have to run your bluray or whatever you're using through a sound system of some sort.  This is a better option anyway because what you have here is an ultimate home movie experience and for that, you need the ultimate sound experience as well.  The picture on the 5025UB is stunning.  I will update this review down the road because I had to order a sound converter in order to watch through my bluray player with sound and I was foolish and ordered the thing from Hong Kong; so I'm still waiting.  Although I have watched movies through a DVD player and have watched some visuals from my bluray player and it was jaw dropping.  Just watching it through a lousy ol' dvd player was exciting enough.  I watched about 5 minutes of 3D Avatar with my 3d bluray player without sound and it was glorious.I set this up about 10 feet away from a wall of mine with just a light blue paint to it and blew the screen up as far as it would go and I roughly measured this to be about a 90-inch screen. It was an easy setup and it looked so good right out of the box, I didn't even mess with any of the color settings or knit-picky settings. After looking at the visuals on the bluray player, I don't know why you would have to mess with the settings.The best part about this 3D projector is that I thought I would have to buy a whole new set of 3D glasses.  I have a 3D Samsung television in my living room and I have Samsung SSG-5150GB 3D glasses for it. I figured on a whim I'd see if they would actually work with this projector before I went off and bought new glasses and low and behold.... THEY DID.I love movies and now I love them even more. With this projector in my home, I am complete.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21LWG2LXSBW2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5HZYKI#wasThisHelpful","R21LWG2LXSBW2Z","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wasn't so sure about this product at first. I'm not a huge cologne wearer but I started with just a single spritz on the neck to see if it lasted, if I smelled it or if anybody else noticed it. None of those came to fruit so I upped the dosage to two and 1/2 or 3 and after doing this for a bit, I don't honestly care what anybody else thinks I smell like. I like what I smell like. Laoste L!VE has a nice even scent to it. It lasts a long time and it isn't obnoxious or overpowering. It's just a nice calm subtle smell to it. I've yet to have anybody comment on my cologne but I have noticed some squirrely eyes from some unsuspecting ladies wondering why they were so attracted to my awkward self.Bottom line though, I'm more attracted to myself and that's where it starts.

"For somebody who has sleep problems combined with work hours problems, I couldn't get into this bed fast enough to see if it changed my fortune. The mattress comes compressed in a box for easier shipping and when you take it out of its plastic wrapping it begins Decompressing; which is sort of cool watching it increase in size. The instructions are simple and easy; let the mattress decompress (which takes 24 to 72 hours) and then use it. I let it decompress for about a day and it was just fine. I removed my old mattress with the dips and craters and inserted this one.I've heard a lot of things about memory foam mattress; one being that they make you sweaty and they are hard.  One I haven't found to be true and the other is, but with a twist. I haven't found that this bed makes me sweaty in the least. In fact, it is actually cooling (hence the cooling gel). The bed however is hard, but once you lay down and find your spot, you will wake up in a 'you'-sized indention that is similar to if  you had slept in an organized and not messy pile of sand. This indention keeps you from tossing and turning and improves your sleep. There is no better proof that this works to keep somebody from tossing and turning than my 9-year old sleeping in it and not waking me up with a foot to my ribs or inexplicably laying at the foot of the bed.Since I started sleeping in the memory foam bed I am actually dreaming vividly again. I go to work at 3am every weekday morning and I usually go home after my work day and take a nap. I'm even dreaming then! This is a great bed and I thought it would take some time to get used to. Nope. Since day one I have been sleeping soundly and waking up in the exact same place I closed my eyes in. I can't wait to go back to bed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24E0QJWPV30EB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWTJ9OA#wasThisHelpful","R24E0QJWPV30EB","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Gravwell, you play as a spacecraft sucked into a black hole trying to escape in a gravity-free zone, using only floating elements and debris to send you backward and forward, hopefully toward escape. It's the kind of game that you would see played on the television show ""The Big Bang Thoery"" with floating elements and calculations needed to succeed. Ultimately, the elements that you encounter don't necessary do what that particular element would do, it's all hypothetical and you are basically using the letters of those elements to determine who goes first on each turn.There's a lot of fun strategy in Gravwell. Playing it for the first time was difficult to get a grasp on and we read the instructions for a good long time before the gist of the game finally clicked and we had a big giant palm to the forehead, ""Oh, I get it now!""  moment.  Reading the instructions and understanding the game actually took longer than the game to play... the first time. That won't happen again. The game takes about 30 minutes to play.You have 6 rounds of play to escape and the first one to succeed leaves the others suckers to die in the gravwell. Succeeding involves playing the right cards because you can't just 'drive' through a black hole, you have to coast and you have to coast properly. Some cards make you go toward the nearest ship (which could be BEHIND YOU), some cards make you go away from ships (but not once you get past the singularity), some cards are tractor beams which pull everything toward you by two spaces and everybody has 1 emergency stop card that they can use once per round to prevent one bad movement.  The trick is, you may have a plan before everybody moves that will catapult you toward freedom, but once people start playing their cards, the plan changes.This is a fun game that makes you groan outloud and celebrate outloud.  There are multiple ways to play as well (they are in the rule book) that can spruce up the fun. Once you get the basic game down, you can play 4 other radical ways or make up your own way of playing. I love games that can be altered and bended to suit the players. I also love games that involve strategy, misguided strategy and strategy that can be pulled out from under you like a rug.Good game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JZ01T9LJOMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617682934#wasThisHelpful","R3JZ01T9LJOMT","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are round disk snacks that my dog was at first reluctant to enjoy. I have a small Chihuahua and these are maybe meant for a larger dog (most snacks are). They are also pretty hard (another setback for my dog). After watching her stare at it, lick it and leave it alone for a few minutes, I decided to break the snack up (which was easy) into small Chihuahua bites and she then enjoyed the heck out of them.  I'm not a dog, so I can't tell, but I would imagine if I were a dog I would be complaining about the hardness of these snacks. You'd have to have some pretty righteous teeth strength to chew these things.  If I bought a beef jerky at the gas station and it was this tough, I'd wing it out the car window.My dog did enjoy them though, once I broke them up into small bites.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R215NRZ4DEC0Q4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIM9UO6#wasThisHelpful","R215NRZ4DEC0Q4","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Munchkin Panic"" is a fun and funny game that can be played by pretty much anybody. The age on the box says 10+ and I'd agree with that, but only because the rules are multi-faceted and a little complex for a young child. If you throw away your hard core rules following instincts though, the games rules can be tinkered with to suit whatever your situation.The game can be played as individual players or as teams defending your keep against the onslaught of many dangerous monsters like Lawyers, Maul rats, Insurance salesmen or 3,182 orcs (which are easier to defeat than the lawyers) and many others. As they move toward your castle you have to use your thought process and timing as to when to attack and how to keep the onslaught of bad guys from overtaking you.As I said earlier, this is a great game for adults who want to soup up the difficulty and beat the heck out of each other and a great game for young kids who maybe need some work thinking about processes and not necessarily living in the moment and planning for the future. This is why I love the game so much. I have a 9-year old and when playing with him, I can see the difficulty he has planning for his next move because he lives in the now. In this game though, you have to plan because you are equipped with a certain amount of knights, guards, archers etc. and they can only be used at certain times.Fun game for all ages.  Rules that can be toyed with to suit the situation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHM7PXQX6WYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD176IE#wasThisHelpful","R1GHM7PXQX6WYA","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you‚Äôre like me, you were sort of indifferent about a sequel to the 2011 hit family film ‚ÄúDolphin Tale‚Äù about a dolphin who lost his tail in a crab trap. The films are based on the true life adventures of the Dolphin named ‚ÄòWinter‚Äô who resides at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Florida. The aquarium is a rehab and release facility and that becomes part of the story that makes up ‚ÄúDolphin Tale 2‚Äù.‚ÄúDolphin Tale 2‚Äù is a mix between authentic and informative and overblown self-importance. Winter is in desperate need of a dolphin-pairing and the stability of the Clearwater Marine Aquarium is at stake. The administrators of the aquarium, including Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick, Jr.) are faced with moral dilemmas as to how to achieve that. That‚Äôs about it, but you would think the way some of the scenes play out that the end of the free world were at stake.To be fair, at the end of the film you will see some actual footage of the events portrayed in the film and you will be impressed at how accurate the staged scenes were to the real thing. To an adult viewer though, many of the scenes played out like overblown Hollywood self-importance and would have served better being downplayed. In nearly all the instances, the drama didn‚Äôt need to be manufactured by Hollywood magic; music, dialogue and tension. For someone who sees a lot of movies, like I do, the racked-up tension reeked of filmmakers trying to sensationalize.‚ÄúDolphin Tale 2‚Äù is a fine family film with charming characters and some poignant moments into the thin line between humans and animals. Morgan Freeman brings some nice wit and personality to the film as well. In fact, there is a lot to like about the movie as a whole. I enjoyed the personalities, the photography and the creator‚Äôs ability to give insight into the animals portrayed, but the films souped-up self-importance was unnecessary.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12KTKSKIM5OFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIIQL4K#wasThisHelpful","R12KTKSKIM5OFO","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son loved this book but it took him about 25 minutes to read the whole thing and he was done. The artwork is pretty quality but it's a pretty simple book. I like Ricky Ricotta because in the back of all their books they usually have a flip-page demonstration or how animation works demonstration. This one was just okay. The flip-paging didn't consist of much. In fact... it was just 2 pages each for I think 3 different animations.When it says Book 1 though, it means it. Ricky Ricotta, when the book begins, has yet to bring about his Mighty Robot and he is inspired to do so because of some bullys at school.

"Roll for it is a fun game that takes the game Yahtzee's best qualities and adds a little bit of strategy to it. Of course, there is a strategy to Yahtzee as well, but ultimately you are only as lucky as your roll.  In ""Roll for It"" you are only as lucky as your role as well, but as you role, you have to wager whether to roll fewer dice in an attempt to get certain cards.You can play with 2-4 players and you each have the same amount of dice. You turn over 3 cards from the deck and they have point values awarded for rolling the dice on the card. You can get lucky and roll everything on the card in one toss... or maybe you will only get 2 or three of the dice on the card. So then you have to decide whether to take those dice out and put them next to the card, lessoning the power of your next role. All the while, your opponents are going for the same cards.It's a fun and simple game that my son and I played for a couple of hours the other day before he started getting emotional when he lost. We'll play again when he toughens up, cause I don't like to lose. I'd give it 5-stars but I'm pretty stingy and the game is nothing ground-breaking.

"After the 2005 release of ‚ÄúSin City‚Äù, Robert Rodriquez announced that there would be more from the fictional city immortalized by the graphic novels of Frank Miller.  After completing the screenplay in 2007, the film though went into hiatus until 2012 when filming began. ‚ÄúA Dame to Kill For‚Äù has had a long journey to the big screen and it‚Äôs up to us to determine if it was worth the wait.‚ÄúA Dame to Kill For‚Äù is a blending of four-short stories, ‚ÄúJust Another Saturday Night‚Äù, ‚ÄúA Dame to Kill For‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Long Bad Night‚Äù and ‚ÄúNancy‚Äôs Last Dance‚Äù. All of these stories have one thing in common; revenge. Revenge is a bitter pill and mixed with the dirty, dark reputation of Sin City, there isn‚Äôt much of an upside to the emotions explored in the movie. Everybody talks with gravelly voices and everybody broods relentlessly; everybody.This is what you come to expect when you venture into Sin City though. You shouldn‚Äôt expect anything else. The name says it all. For that matter, ‚ÄúA Dame to Kill For‚Äù is a beautiful mix of graphic justice and deep, dark intentions from near everybody involved. On top of that, the cartoonish backdrop blend with real actors and environments comes across brilliantly in 3D and for that alone is worth a trip to the theater. Within minutes of the film beginning you are immersed in the visuals of Sin City and the stories it has to tell. As well, you will feel the heavy weight that Sin City bares.This though, may be part of the movies problem because as good of a job as the movie does to bring you there and drag you into its filth, once you‚Äôre done with the journey, you may be anxious to leave. You don‚Äôt venture to Sin City to find joy and happiness, but you also don‚Äôt go to the movies to feel weighted down by relentless drama, darkness and human filth. ‚ÄúA Dame to Kill For‚Äù is exactly what you expect and don‚Äôt expect anything else.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYM3HEWTIFPX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXU9VUK#wasThisHelpful","RYM3HEWTIFPX9","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It has been a little more than twenty-years since the `muppetish' ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III"" and I'd have to admit that with the popularity and quality of the Nickelodeon cartoon, that a reboot was warranted. The pre-criticism has been rampant and nowadays that's fairly typical. Everybody has access to computers and phones and can voice their opinions like never before. More importantly, everybody can make a better movie than those that do.There is plenty to criticize about ""TMNT 2014"", but it may or may not have been a better movie than expected. Megan Fox was just fine as April O'Neill, the Turtles did have unique personalities and the fact that the turtles had noses wasn't a big deal in the least. On the other hand, although Michael Bay didn't direct the film (Johnathan Liebsman did), the markings of Producer Bay were all over the film, and that's not a good thing.As with 1998's Michael Bay brain-hurter ""Armageddon"", many of the sequences are edited into hundreds of three-second shots that are tough to watch. The opening animated sequence was such an assault on the senses that I had to look away from the screen during it. It was such a flurry of shots that I was so busy concentrating on the bombardment that I have zero idea what was even said during it. Much of the film is shot with a handy-cam style and in close, making some of the darker scenes pointless in 3D and some of the scenes actually really cool. It was a mixed bag.Another trademark of Michael Bay reared its ugly head with one ridiculous scene that didn't have to be so ridiculous, and I'm not even talking about the tower falling scene at the end of the film. A scene of cars and trucks crashing down a snowy hill was okay until it went on and on forever and just kept tumbling and tumbling further into overdone land. Not to mention, two human characters somehow survived the idiocy.I could go on and on with the criticisms; some of the scenes were staged ridiculously and Will Arnett's character, Vernon Fenwick, was way too heroic toward the end of the movie, which was a total over-step. Yet, notice I said nothing about Megan Fox and the Turtles were, well, the turtles. That being said, the movie was fun. You can sit there all day and criticize and knit-pick (and you certainly can) or you can forget your critical eye and have fun. If you do that, Turtles is good enough.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EKD7U6WC1D73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MI1X58S#wasThisHelpful","R3EKD7U6WC1D73","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty busy vacuum cleaner with settings, buttons, filters and modes. You have to sort of pay attention to what you're doing and make adjustments. In other words, if you're vacuuming hardwood floor, set the vacuum to floor. If you're vacuuming curtains, set it to curtains, etc. I vacuumed my living room floor once before realizing that I didn't have the vacuum set to the proper carpet setting. I adjusted it correctly and noticed a tremendous difference in the job that it did.There are many features to this vacuum that I REALLY like. I really like the HEPA filter that sits in the top of the motor. It has a tab on it that lets you know when it needs to be replaced. Sure, that's just another thing you have to get in order for your vacuum to do its job, but the benefits are great, especially if you have allergies and pets. Most vacuums allow much of these tiny danders and allergens to just escape back into the air; not this one.The vacuum is heavy for a vacuum cleaner, but as you run it, it has a forward pushing feature to it that almost resembles a lawn mower that rolls forward, limiting the amount of pushing you have to do. I love this because despite the weight of the vacuum, pushing it requires little to zero effort. Add the flexibility of the handle to his feature and I was whipping this vacuum cleaner all over the place with ease; hitting corners, angles, etc.Occassionally the flexibility of the handle would release when I wasn't trying to, which was a little annoying and troublesome, but that aside, this is a great vacuum cleaner that is easy to use and has powerful suction. Note: Don't vacuum near anything you would like to keep because it will devour it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZL7M6XDI9EY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K25QDCW#wasThisHelpful","RZL7M6XDI9EY4","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some may say that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was the throw away movie for Marvel Studios. It comes from a lesser known series of comics and characters that have spanned sporadically throughout the Marvel universe since 1969. Even some Marvel faithful's were forced to admit that they were unfamiliar with the characters. Marvel Studios may have thought it was a throw away movie but Director James Gunn didn't think so. In fact, in my opinion, Marvel may have told James Gunn to just have fun with it because that's what it looks like, and he certainly did.On top of just plain being a complete blast of a movie to watch, ""Guardians"" may just be more poetic and meaningful than it ever planned on being. The characters Star-lord, Rocket Raccoon, Groot, Drax the Destroyer and Gamora, form an unlikely team of misfits. As the movie guides us through the details of how they become a team, they dance a fine line between hatred, love, respect and disrespect. This bond is the glue that holds the whole movie together and culminates with some well-placed emotion that reminds you how important it is for somebody to have your back and visa-versa.I was a little worried that ""Guardians"" would not be as snappy and catchy as the amazing trailer that began circulating earlier this year but my concern was quickly thwarted. The movie is from beginning to end, completely engaging and never once loses the snappiness that you come to expect. The characters are evenly layered and completely unique; which makes their coming together as a team all the more interesting.Director James Gunn had some fun with ""Guardians"" and in doing so, may have paid the ultimate homage to Marvel's creator, Stan Lee. Coming from Troma Pictures, he's used to having some creative liberties and he's proven that his liberties are usually good ones. What may have been a forgotten comic book series for Marvel has been revitalized and is one of the most entertaining movies to come along in years. It isn't without fault; the ending is a little confusing and disappointing, but everything that happens before that is more than worth the price of admission.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PZB9YGGHEHMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NNM95Y#wasThisHelpful","R2PZB9YGGHEHMG","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Renny Harlin's ""Legend of Hercules"" that was released earlier this year wasn't very good. Maybe that's why Brett Ratner's ""Hercules"" is coming out now, in the middle of the summer when there's a fresh new audience of people that no longer remember ""Legend"". The two movies, while about the same thing, are like night and day. ""Legend"" was more mythological and true to the legend of the strongman and ""Hercules"" is more grounded in reality; focusing upon how legends are created and exaggerated.I found this aspect of ""Herclues"" really rewarding because I like things grounded in reality. Even when things get ridiculous, I like when they play it off as ridiculous, rather than normalcy. Ratner took all the mythological aspects of Hercules and made them stories or possible exaggerations to be believed or not. On the surface, Hercules (Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock) is just a man with great size and strength, but his legend has spread and he is worshipped as something more than just a man.""Hercules"" did a lot of things right but that depends upon what you're looking for. If you're looking for something along the lines of ""300"" or ""Clash of the Titans"", look elsewhere. As I said, this is Hercules grounded in reality. There will be nothing portrayed here that is beyond possibility. Ratner makes sure that you have a strong emotional contact with Hercules and his band of warriors; again, something I really like.This was a role that Dwayne Johnson was seemingly born to play and it is probably one of his best movies to date. Surprisingly enough, along with the machismo, the movie is written with some pretty good comedy as well; which adds to the personal connection you feel with the characters. ""Hercules"" is a step up from ""Legend of Hercules"" due to its character development and story, but not a huge step up. It still lacks in importance and it still had a conclusion you could see a mile away. The outstanding 3D, fight sequences, character development and comedy saved the day though, making ""Hercules"" a passable summer movie that should have grand success on video.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SBDNX13J2AQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M265CSU#wasThisHelpful","R3SBDNX13J2AQF","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For such a cool concept, ""Watch Dogs"" actually just borrows everything that it is from three games that have come before, ""Assassins Creed"", ""GTA"" and ""Call of Duty"". You have a grand environment that is open. There is a lot of driving and there is a multi-player/on-line aspect to it as well. I admittedly haven't played the whole game through yet, but my assessment so far is that the game is very very busy, repetitive and for a game that requries a lot of driving, has terrible driving mechanics.The graphics are quality but the gameplay has its issues. The two most prevalent things about the game, the hacking and the driving are the biggest problem and that doesn't bode well. Driving around is like driving on a sheet of ice, unless you have a large truck of some sort and then you can control it better; which makes no sense. The hacking become repetitious after you do it a few times. It doesn't get more interesting.Of course for a game about hacking they have to leave open a window for actual hackers to hack your game and everybody loves getting hacked don't they? Not a fan of this. In concept I'm sure it sounded fun to the creators who undoubtedly allowed this aspect to exist but in reality, it quite simply isn't.Could have been a great game, but it's just an okay one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PC7W6R6AGEMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGHUS58#wasThisHelpful","R1PC7W6R6AGEMB","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good product if you just need something to keep notes in or something that you need noted for the time-being. I wouldn't consider this all that long lasting. As most everything is these days, Mead is most likely nickel and diming people by decreasing the grade or thickness of their paper. This is certainly not just a Mead tactic. I've noticed this with many other paper companies as well.

"I was struggling hard with some allergies when I found this product and I figured I'd give it a shot. At first I wasn't sure if it was working or not because it didn't have an immediate impact, but as all natural products do, it took time to work its 'magic'. Within about 5-days, the fatigue that I was feeling from the allergies in my sinus passages disappeared and I have no doubts that it is from ""Queen's Magic"". I switched to natural remedies three-years ago and it made a total transformation of me but I had yet to find something that controlled my allergies effectively.One of my first instincts was to question whether or not The Queen's Magic would spike my blood sugar. I recently found out that I am a diabetic, not a bad one, but I didn't want to take something that would make me worse. Upon doing some research, I found that Queen's Magic actually helps control blood sugar and many have theorized that it may or could be something that would eliminate the effects of diabetes entirely. That I've yet to see but I will be the first to let you know if it does.Bottom line though, with all natural remedies, you can't judge them right away. You have to give them time. Keep a chart. Make a comparision in how you feel after taking it for a decent amount of time. I can without question say that this worked for me. In the heart of allergy season, two weeks into taking these and I haven't even thought about my allergies for the last 5 or 6 days.To top it off... I e-mailed Eden Pond to ask them about the blood sugar thing and while they weren't allowed to give me a medical diagnosis, they responded quickly and I was able to have a really good conversation with them about the intent of their product and that just pushed my approval of the product over the top.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T9X6VY4IS9M7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092ICBEY#wasThisHelpful","R1T9X6VY4IS9M7","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pierre Boulle‚Äôs 1963 novel ‚ÄúLa Planete‚Äô des Singes‚Äù spawned many ‚ÄúPlanet of the Apes‚Äù movies that spans nearly 50-years, beginning with the classic Charlton Heston film in 1968. All of which have the same theme that appears to never get old; the fragility of humanity and the senselessness of war. This version, ‚ÄúDawn of the Planet of the Apes‚Äù is the follow up to 2011‚Äôs ‚ÄúRise of the Planet of the Apes‚Äù. I‚Äôm not too sure there‚Äôs much of a difference between the words ‚ÄòRise‚Äô and ‚ÄòDawn‚Äô, but that‚Äôs beside the point.I could nit-pick a few nickel and dime flaws in ‚ÄúDawn of the Planet of the Apes‚Äù, but the essence of the franchise and its meaning is alive and well. 2011‚Äôs ‚ÄúRise‚Äù was an okay movie with a small plot and a cool Caesar ape portrayed by Andy Serkis who is quickly becoming a legend of playing CGI characters; Gollum, King Kong and now Caesar. ‚ÄúDawn of the Planet of the Apes‚Äù is a huge step up from ‚ÄúRise‚Äù in nearly every way possible.If you thought Caesar was cool in ‚ÄúRise‚Äù, wait until you see ‚ÄúDawn‚Äù. In 1968, ‚ÄúPlanet of the Apes‚Äù set a standard for makeup and costuming by creating a community of apes that looked amazing. Now days, watching 1968‚Äôs ‚ÄúPlanet‚Äù, we are no longer amazed at guys and girls in monkey suits. The motion capture technology in ‚ÄúDawn‚Äù has set a new standard, just as ‚ÄúPlanet‚Äù did back then. Although as good as it is, effects alone do not make a movie.‚ÄúDawn‚Äù isn‚Äôt complicated. You‚Äôd think that it would be as the name portrays, but it really isn‚Äôt. Co-existence is apparently a tough thing to practice in the real world and in monkey/human movies. That is pretty much the nuts and bolts of the movie. It isn‚Äôt done on a grand scale, as the word ‚Äòplanet‚Äô implies, but in a small mountainous area. Ideals collide and symbolic struggles begin.‚ÄúDawn of the Planet of the Apes‚Äù is a really good movie and a big step up from its predecessor, but it certainly isn‚Äôt without some mild flaws. The biggest of those in my opinion, wasn‚Äôt the small scale of the film but in one final motivation right before the credits rolled that took everything you learned throughout the film about Caesar and tossed it out the window. Fortunately, they saved that until the very ending and it doesn‚Äôt ruin a really good time at the movies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5XPP5ON0XZ9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNGZLDA#wasThisHelpful","R5XPP5ON0XZ9M","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won't judge this film based on the fact that it is a low-budget independent film with many handicaps in comparison to other larger budget movies. Clearly the creators had access to some really nice cameras, some acceptable film locations, the vault of cast off Lord of the Rings costumes and makeups and some pretty decent actors. The potential for something great and message sending to the billion dollar Lord of the Rings franchise and big studios was all there, it just wasn't realized.Fine, make a fantasy movie, but if you're going to use all the costumes and makeup from the Lord of the Rings vault at least alter them to make them unique. Fine, make a fantasy movie, but if you're going to use the Lord of the Rings costumes and makeups, how about trying to avoid things that reek of the Lord of the Rings.... like a crazy cave troll.... an elfish-female type character who speaks to other characters... with her mind... in nearly the exact same voice as Cate Blanchett from the Lord of the Rings.How about making a film with some personality instead of being so convoluted that I can only compare it to ""Dune"". They should have issued a manual with the movie just so you can keep everything straight or know what people are talking about when they say stuff like this:  ""The shadow agent has the ashes of Amenkah (or something like that) and the blood of Gotha-Zool (?). He took the canteen I collected at the bleeding stone. When they are mixed together at the entrance of the underworld, they will raise a avatar of Gotha-zool lord of the dead. With him at their head, their legions swelling with the corpses they'll reanimate... etc. etc.""All of the dialogue is like this. In fact, everything is over-acted and over-staged. Fight sequence are edited so loosely, you can actually see the actor for a split second waiting to hear 'action' before moving. The music plays through the film as if they want you to love this movie like the Lord of the Rings with such drama and importance, but you can't. They want you to care, but all you can do is watch mindnumbingly as they talk about things like you should know who and what they are talking about.Movies should let their audience play along. It doesn't have to be dummied down until it is stupid or simple.... but it doesn't have to be ""DUNE"" and it should NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER make you think of another movie as you watch it at any time. Especially one as epic and memorable as the Lord of the RIngs. There are some good things about ""Curse of the Dragon Slayer"", but movies like this disappoint me. It's 2014 and this is something that Roger Corman would have made in the 1970s. That's fine if that was what the creators intended, but it is obviously NOT what they intended.  They intended to be a more adult version of ""Lord of the Rings"" and while they certainly succeeded, they also succeeded in making a bad movie despite having all the right tools to make a good one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PPEBCPFZVP2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IORPR90#wasThisHelpful","R3PPEBCPFZVP2O","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on the real-life accounts of former New York Cop Ralph Sarchie, ""Deliver Us from Evil"" makes you wonder if this craziness actually happened, or some retired cop figured he'd make some bucks off of hyping up something sort of similar that actually happened. I have no opinion on this, but I do have an opinion on the movie that delivered a mixed bag of intrigue, shocks, gore and monotony.From the early going the movie has you on the edge of your seat. The intrigue is well done and the two cops on the beat type storytelling is always a draw for me. Sarchie (Eric Bana) and his partner McHale are tying the events of multiple cases together to track down a bizarre and complicated criminal. The things they find are gruesome and the evidence they find string you the viewer along as a third-person very capably.Unfortunately the events leading up to the culmination are the most interesting part of the film. Not that the culmination wasn't interesting or fulfilling, but at one point, what was a relentlessly entertaining and intriguing movie dropped off into a form of monotony. It was like being in a racing car for about fifty minutes and then veering off into 40mph traffic for thirty minutes. The monotonous moments in the film should have been spread out over the length of the movie, but instead they chose to do it all at once and then deliver their grand finale.After viewing ""Deliver us From Evil"", I couldn't help thinking that we've been here before numerous times. With it being based upon real-life accounts, maybe that was unavoidable, but the ""Se7en"" meets ""The Exorcist"" premise hung there like a ghost and both of those were better films; much better films. Maybe even the finale would have been more interesting had we not already seen it dozens of times in other films. The only director to ever make an exorcism on film different than everybody else was Tim Burton in ""Beetlejuice"".""Deliver us from Evil"" is a passable film with talented people in front of and behind the camera, but it just needed to find a way to transfuse that edge of the seat delivery from the beginning of the film into the second half.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RMKQ1DOYZSXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LH9ROKM#wasThisHelpful","R3RMKQ1DOYZSXA","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cool figurine that is about 15% bobblehead. I wouldn't necessarily consider this a childs play-toy, although it absolutely is. This is not the kind of toy you give to your kid so that they can recreate their own little movie in their head or move it around, etc. This has very limited mobility and as I said, is part bobblehead. Me personally, I put my bobbleheads on a shelf for observation. They aren't played with.This Rocket Raccoon has a cool gun that activates by hitting the button i.e. loader on the top. It rattles off a powerful (simulated) shot that causes the bobblehead and body to shake and rattle.

"Michael Bay is like an old faithful horse packed with rocket launchers, laser-eyes and the ability to gallop through buildings, causing them to crumble to the ground. Also you may as well slap a Pepsi-Cola, Budweiser or John Deere logo on the rear end of that horse in order to truly cap off explaining Michael Bay. Michael Bay is the Nascar or WWE of Hollywood's movie directors. In fact, Michael Bay has even said, ""I make movies for teenage boys. Oh dear, what a crime.""Well, it may not be a `crime', but it may not be the best use of your gifts and opportunities. Despite the fact that critics have bombasted his films for years, Bay continues to rock the box office with big numbers. For the same reason why professional wrestling is still a huge money maker and ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" lasted nine seasons, you can expect more Bay-type movies. As long as people want their action movies simple-minded and relentlessly destructive, Bay will continue to get opportunities and others will not.As far as Bay Movies go, ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" is one of his better movies. It certainly makes the second and third Transformers installments look like the drink coasters I thought they were. At a ridiculous 165-minutes, those who crave their chaos in unforgiving amounts will get exactly what they paid for. In fact, many of the action sequences had me in awe and appreciating good old fashion mindless fun. Even better, Bay even managed to attach a pretty good human element to his destruction epic.With that human element comes a fine line in believability when it comes to some sequences. It's a Bay movie though; who cares about believability? Well, I do. So, numerous instances where Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) appeared to be more James Bond or Jason Bourne than farmland inventor were problematic. A teenage girl survives numerous falls and even is thrown down on a highway at high speed and rolls on the pavement, only to hop up without a scratch as if she were made of that Stretch Armstrong material. The worst of those were the instances where humans survived numerous falls without a scratch or were showered with the debris from dozens of buildings. That though, is typical Michael Bay.I'm certain there are better movie-makers and movies out there (Edge of Tomorrow), but unfortunately and apparently there is a huge market for Bay and that keeps us from seeing other people given the same bankroll to make their movie. ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" is an epic action movie that will please those who love this type thing and it is good enough that it may even please some that don't. Yet, its typical Bay delivery will take away from its longevity. When the credits rolled, I no longer cared and that is the long legacy of such films.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OP46X14Z7WL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4K3MLE#wasThisHelpful","R3OP46X14Z7WL9","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son was so excited to see this movie today on BLURAY 3D!!!. I was prepared to go buy it and surprise him with it when I picked him up. NOPE. Not paying $35 for any movie. I don't care how much trumped up junk you throw in it. To make matters worse, Amazon offers this for $34.96 (just 4-cents short of free-shipping... making it $39). There is NOTHING in this edition other than a lego figure that any other 3D RELEASE hasn't offered. When will movie studios get the hint that PEOPLE ARE POOR RIGHT NOW!! Oh, I forgot... their rich.  *sigh*... guess I'll $1 rent it.  So sorry Warner... no $$$$ from me.  Now my review of this FUN MOVIE:Every parent in the free world knows the mystique and endlessness of the Lego and every parent in the world knows the feeling of waking up in the middle of the night and feeling one of those Legos seemingly cut your foot to the bone. They also know the price tag of such Lego's and their child's disregard for formalities. That's what makes ""The Lego Movie"" such a great thing. While the 3D is dazzling and entertaining, the Lego's don't come out of the screen so that you can step on them and the price tag is no different than any other movie (unless you're talking about the 3D bluray ‡≤†_‡≤†)All that aside, ""The Lego Movie"" is a creative and imaginative movie for all ages. An ordinary lego named Emmet Brickowski wakes up in his world where 'Everything is Awesome' and soon finds his ordinary world exploded into a world of endless possibility. When Emmet finds a mysterious girl named Wildstyle tinkering around his construction site after hours, he becomes involved in her search for an object called 'the piece of resistance'; thus opening his eyes to incredible possibilities.Every moment of the movie is endlessly entertaining and we quickly realize that the possibilities keep us continuously on our toes and unsure of what may be next. The little in-destructive pieces just keep clicking together to form more and more environments and story-lines. The entire thing plays out like an epic play day for any child; even with ghosts on strings and boats and spaceships moving off screen with a 'brrrrrrrrrrr...'With all the pop culture references and movie references, ""The Lego Movie"" is a movie that everybody will enjoy. There are endless movie references and characters such as Batman, Superman, Han Solo, Chewie, Gandolf and so on. Not only that, you won't understand the ultimate meaning of the film until its finale. After watching a movie that played liked an assault on the synapse, it finished with a feeling of calm and promise.Sure, it may have been the longest commercial in the history of film-making, but despite stepping on those little things in the middle of the night and crying out in pain, or wondering why such a little tiny thing costs so much money, Lego's are an amazing source of imagination, patience and building mentality for children; just like the movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T30Z34PXJ5LV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J11U4J6#wasThisHelpful","R2T30Z34PXJ5LV","A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have an asus t100 netbook / laptop that I use when I travel. When the device was built there was only 1 USB 3.0 port added. This lack of having support for multiple devices is not always easy. The best solution for this problem is to add a mini hub that is either powered or not powered. What I like about this hub is it can be used either way. This unit does come with the power supply and plug.I also have the mini version of this device and it is not powered.Now with any device the transfer rate can depend upon the device and what is being used. I was able to attach a Seagate hard drive to the hub and transfer at anywhere from 30 MBS to 40 MBS  for some large files. My larger i7 laptop was a bit faster.Overall this has been a good hub. the size is small, the transfers work, I get 4 more places to add devicesIf anything changes I will modify my review in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1815Y3T5V3M9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046TML4E#wasThisHelpful","R1815Y3T5V3M9W","A3POO958KE65MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3POO958KE65MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I shoot a ton of video every week for my youtube channels. This weekend was not different. I went to Monterey Bay California for car week and was able to not just get videos but cool pictures of cars with this card in my Samsung Note 3 (smn900v).I also loaded this card into my panasonic x920 and put the settings as high as they would go... zero problems.This card took everything I threw at it and then some. I would have prefered to use a 128gb card but I cant really complain since this one was free.The card was accepted by my phone as soon as I put it in. There was no formatting needed.I shot a ton of videos all day in 1080 and didnt run out of room.When I took the card out and transfered the files they went to the laptop quickly. Transfer always depends on the device the card is in and the load on the laptop. This card bounced between 60 an 80 mbs with an iogear usb3.0 card reader on an asus i7 laptop using isb 3.0 ports.By the way if you have never been to car week in monterey you have to go.

"I love my Sonicare tooth brush. I was commanded by my dentist to get a Sonicare toothbrush and at first I fought the idea. I realized they were trying to help me out so I could get a better job done brushing. I ended up ordering a Sonicare and even let the technician pick it out on my amazon app. This healthy white plus is a step above my original Sonicare. If you have never used one of these brushes you are in for a surprise of not just what they do but also how they feel when brushing your teeth. These brushes are amazing and do help with getting the job done.What is really cool is the near charge with this device. There are not metal contacts viable and the brush shuts off as soon as it hits the base if it on.Update 9-5-15 - This toothbrush has the wider head then what my first Sonicare came with, this is the head to get Philips Sonicare HX6062/64 Diamondclean Replacement Brush Heads, Standard even if you have an older sonicare.

"If you have an android phone or tablet and would like more storage these are the perfect attachment to hook up a thumb drive or card reader to. I have some 256 GB thumb drives and these OTG cables will transfer or store just about anything I need. I travel frequently and tend to give one of these to someone on just about every trip. Its best to buy a few at a time as they don't cost very much.  The difference between USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 is the width of the connection that goes into the phone. The 3.0 is the wider version found on newer Samsung phones. You can use a 2.0 with a newer version phone but there is not enough room to plug a USB 3.0 into an older phone with the smaller connection.This is the better version to get if you have a thick case than the cable with the right hand turned connector.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y3BVTDWH8Y7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHI961I#wasThisHelpful","R1Y3BVTDWH8Y7A","A3POO958KE65MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3POO958KE65MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have quite a few scents in my collection with almost all of the Tom Ford private collection, a few from Creed, a few from Ramon Monegal and even Clive Christian C. In all total I have 130 different scents and I have to say this is one of the most unique there is. To begin with everyone I know who has bought this scent hates it for the first few minutes until it sets up properly and that will take about 10 - 20 minutes and then they love it. I cant even compare it to anything else I have smelled or is out there. To smell it out of the bottle on a paper card will not do any justice to the way this stuff smell and a little spray does go a long way.There are not many places that sell this scent, the Larger stores would be Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. I have also seen Clive Christian in a few boutique stores as well.If you do not want to smell like everyone else this is a great scent. I get asked all of the time what it is and have no problem telling people because I know most of them will never pay for it. The better bottle to buy is the 3.7 ounce. Yes its $450 here on amazon but this scent is intoxicating.The ingredients are listed as follows: Bergamot, spices, cardamom, ginger, and juniper berry, sambac oil,  cedarwood, moss, cinnamon, jasmine hedione, pimento oil, orris, amber, vetiver oil and vanilla","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I67YVHT02WR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KAMAJE#wasThisHelpful","R1I67YVHT02WR6","A3POO958KE65MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3POO958KE65MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As someone who shoots tons of pictures and videos I do like to know the colors on my screen are correct for a final output. I was surprised how far off my display was once I ran the program for this Spyder 5. I have an Asus laptop that is about 9 months old.The set up for this device is easy.1. Go to the Spyder website and download the program (took a few minutes at 25mbs)2. Install onto the computer3. Go through the activation process - input serial number, name, email address)4. Hold the device to the screen (this was about 4 minutes)5. See how far off the color was form before and afterthis whole process of initial set up took about 10 minutes form start to finish and was very straightforward. The program prompts each step and shows what to do with a seven minute video. I ran the video as I went though the process.This is a cool device for those who take and print pictures for clients, edit and shoot videos or even for someone who wants to make sure the colors being displayed are accurate.  This is easy to use and install. The program is set to automatically remind to run again every months as displays degrade over time. The video says after the first calibration the next run is half the amount of time. Each calibration can be saved.What is nice is the box can be save to hold the Spyder 5 and it is small enough it will not get in the way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D6V5KB5X2SPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBSL3L6#wasThisHelpful","R3D6V5KB5X2SPI","A3POO958KE65MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3POO958KE65MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Almost everyone falls for the :I was planning on getting to that cycle"". This common problem creates a challenge as nothing gets done as soon as it is supposed to. This book outlines the common challenges people face. While reading I am sure you will say ""I have heard this before"" but there is some information to reinforce how to get back on track and actually implement getting your work or goals done.There is a section on getting things done that rely on 4 pillars of 1. Creating, 2. Eliminating, 3. Accepting, 4.PreservingWhat I like about this book is that it is easy to read and there are constant reinforcements that we all tend to not complete what we need to.Self accountability is important and this book reinforces why asking yourself ""Have I completed what I need to today"".

"I was on the fence if I should buy this holder or not as there are plenty out in the market for less than this one. First let me tell you what I use this for. I frequently travel and I shoot videos everywhere I go for either sales training or my travel blog. Being able to use a cell phone instead of a full size camera makes trips way easier.As of 8/2/15 I have purchased 2 more of these square Jellyfish tripod mounts and love them.Here is why you need this holder instead of one that is half the price. First off its built better. I have a samsung note 3 with on otter box on it. When turned sideways ( letter box) it measures 3 5/8 inches. The jaws on this holder will go from 3.25 inches to 6 as an inside the grove measurement. This is a little too large for my samsung s5 with an otter box to lay in the grips horizontally. I also tested this device with my Galaxy tab 8 and it fit with room to spare horizontally (letter box).Now I do have a few holders that I paid $6 - $8 for and there are 2 problems. 1st they are made ok not great and not bad. 2nd they feel like I have to cram my phone in hoping they will not break.Here is why its worth it to spend the $17 on this device: 1. Its made with thicker material than the ones half the price and is more stout. 2. This holder folds up to be about the size of a credit card in is right at 1.5 inches thick overall. 3. The main mount does rotate so the tablet or the phone can have the video aspect rotated on a selfie stick or similar device like a tripod or mount. 4. The grippers or feet fold up as well to make this as small as possible to pack.In all I wish I would have just started with this holder instead of the other 4 cheaper ones I bought recently.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R244EIZEQ21UTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXGF84M#wasThisHelpful","R244EIZEQ21UTQ","A3POO958KE65MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3POO958KE65MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I thought it would be better to have too many than not enough and for the price it was an easy decision. I have a few different devices that have Wasabi batteries in use including my Panasonic X920 video camera and have had zero problems with them in a $800 video camera.The build on these is almost exact to the factory ones except they do not last as long by a few minutes. It is nice to have an extra charger so a few batteries can be charged at the same time.

This book does a great job of explaining ways to manage employees and treat them in a manner where they are respected and allow them to do what they need to.The business world has a way of looking at employees like replaceable things instead of the people who make the engine go. Some business models rely on keeping the feel of a business as if it a science experiment where noting but business can be talked about.Being able to relate to employees on a human level instead of a clinical level does help them to be more productive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7L7U5WH69MLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071847782#wasThisHelpful","R7L7U5WH69MLC","A3POO958KE65MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3POO958KE65MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As I read this book I kept thinking of my 84 year old grandfather. I kind of felt like he was sitting at the table talking to me about the way things used to be. These types of conversations are not a bad thing at all and most of the time they seem comforting.  As I read this book I kept reflecting upon my own life and where I stacked up in comparison towards humble or the center of attention seeker. What kept the book interesting was the part history lesson part character lesson based upon the life events of the person being written about.This book starts out talking about what is valuable in society and where the focus lies today and where it was after WWII. There are some stark differences between today and yesteryear. Some of these changes like technology that make life easier but back then it seems that people were more humble, had manners and everything wasn‚Äôt about them. Most of the people discussed in this book were brought up at the turn of the 1900‚Äôs.Here are the people written about in the book Frances Perkins, Dwight Eisenhower, Dorothy Day, George Marshal, A. Philip Randolph, Mary Anne Elliot, Augustine & Samuel Johnson,Here was the main theme of the book:The push for being the center of attention seems to have distorted the moral compass of society and their own sense of ‚Äúgood‚Äù. The events, trials and struggles we face in life tend to shape up for the good or the bad depending upon the choices we make when at the crossroads of difficult decisions. At some point we gain the fortitude to stick with one type of decision based upon what has been learned in previous adverse situations. Character is built on the tough decisions to be made plus life‚Äôs experiences.In the middle of the challenges it may be the sense of self resolve that keeps us from making the wrong decisions. The underpinning of religion does help people make decisions based upon the morals taught by the respective religions.The ability to be of service to those in need for non self-gratifying reasons does help build character.There are plenty of stories and examples spanning across time and places where people either decide to change or are pushed causing them to dig deep and decide what type of person they would become in the face of adversity, danger and questionable issues that could cause some sort of physical or moral harm. . It seems that as of today society has sacrificed much of character for justification of something else.I have to say I really liked this book and the saying of ‚Äúdo what is right even if nobody is looking‚Äù kept coming to mind. This book was written well and interesting enough for me to sit down and read it without getting up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35GCW236R69V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081299325X#wasThisHelpful","R35GCW236R69V7","A3POO958KE65MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3POO958KE65MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After having been french press users for years, we decided to make the move to a more automated coffee maker. I researched different makers for quite a while, and this one rose to the top as a best buy despite its relatively low price. I was a bit skeptical, but we decided to give it a try over the more expensive makers ... and I'm glad that we did!As others note, make sure you run a number of just-water (or vinegar) cleaning cycles before you attempt to brew coffee. This maker gives off a bit of a plastic-y smell initially, but we found that it completely disappeared after those cleaning cycles.Normal cycles are a breeze, and the resulting coffee is quite nice. The detachable water cannister makes refilling the maker with water a cinch. The removable filter holder makes emptying old grounds and filling it with new grounds way simple. The carafe is excellent as well - coffee stays nice and toasty in there for quite a long time (just be sure that it's empty before you make more coffee!). And the maker is fast! It's just five minutes or so from start to finished coffee.We've found that we need to add a bit more coffee to get coffee that's as strong / tastes similar to our french press, but that's really the only difference. It's been a smooth transition to this maker, and I'm glad that we made the switch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FNF3WOIPGZJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037ZG3DS#wasThisHelpful","R1FNF3WOIPGZJ2","A279A4Y2N1CQ26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A279A4Y2N1CQ26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was expecting something really exceptional for the price tag that came along with this doll and upon receiving it, there is nothing I can justify recommending anyone paying that high price ($40) for.

I actually like lavender but this smell is a bit off to me.All the negatives being stated above, it is a soft doll with a bean bag bottom.

"Having been a mahoosive fan of Celeste Prater's Fueled by Lust series, I was a bit trepidatious about reading this one. For starters, the BDSM scene isn't really my thing, and the few books I have read involving it, didn't do anything for me at all. BUT!!! being as how I loved her Sci-Fi, I thought I would give it a go... and I'm glad I did!Whether or not it rings true doesn't matter to me. What matters is that I found it completely believable within the constraints of the story. The definition of 'Three Divisions' made so much sense, and it made a nice change to have it spelled out in a way that was understandable without being condescending. It actually gave me the warm fuzzies to think that there is someone out there who would be able to take control but also put someone else's needs above their own. I absolutely loved how Leo took care of Jillian, in all ways! The humour was witty and well-timed. I really enjoyed watching Jillian grow, both in the playroom and out. Her put down of Brent was fantastic and I was giving her a high-five at the time!The suspense side of it was exceedingly well-written, with surprises coming left, right and centre. You knew something was up with the amount of 'air time' that Jillian's client got, but the actual outcome, I didn't see coming. Jillian's handling of said event, and the aftermath, were superb - cool, calm and collected.Hopefully without giving anything away, I loved the wrap-up to this book. Everything was as it should be, and I am very much looking forward to the next book in this series. For not liking BDSM books, to giving this one a 5-star and feeling the fuzzies, I can highly recommend it to anyone considering reading about BDSM, or who just wants a steamy, sexy, suspenseful, romantic read.

"This is the first book in the Clan Conroy series, and starts with the Alpha Bear himself, Liam. He has been ordered by the Mother's Council to find a human bride in order to widen the gene pool. He isn't too happy about this, until he meets Meredith and his Bear sits up and takes notice. Meredith doesn't want to be attracted to Liam, especially considering the secret she hides. However, when it comes to Shifters and their Mates, nothing usually gets in their way - not even murder.This is a fast-paced story that was thoroughly enjoyable. However, there are a couple of things where the build up fails to materialise. For example Meredith is dreading her father coming home, but once he is there, she accepts it. Meredith is stressed that the YWCA is going to be closed, but it is sorted out with ease. Now I'm not saying that there should be conflict for the sake of it, but these things were built up to be big issues, and then sort of fizzled out. I won't even mention the history between Meredith's father, Harvey, and Liam and his family.All in all though, this was a sweet and hot Alpha romance that I can definitely recommend.* I received this book from Romance ARCade in return for a fair and honest review.*MerissaArchaeolibrarian - I Dig Good Books!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PGRDZYFUZL3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BH04E8#wasThisHelpful","R3PGRDZYFUZL3F","A3S0H2HV6U1I7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S0H2HV6U1I7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, so Zach was a favourite of mine from Nick and Julian's book. Don't get me wrong, I like Marcus and I think there is so much more to him than we have seen yet, BUT I just love Zach. So many people mistake being quiet for being weak, and Zach shows us how wrong this can be. He has issues in his past, things that should have been dealt with but he's ignored them, hoping they'll go away. Sam also has issues, but has been dragged along to a weekend conference by his well-meaning (straight) best friend. Once these two meet, the attraction is instantaneous and HOT! I won't go any further into the story, but suffice it to say, they both have to deal with their issues before they can move on.There is so much that I love about this book - the fact that they are both the 'quiet' ones, they love being at home and not at parties, they are not afraid of being romantic, I could go on. Anyone who has read any of my reviews knows that I am a complete slush-puppy where romance is concerned. If it is done well, then I love it. This hasn't just been done 'well', this is outstanding. None of it seemed forced, it was all completely natural between the two main characters. In fact, not just the romance, but the whole book, including interactions with their families and friends.By the time I had finished reading this amazing book, I was a complete sappy mess but with the biggest smile on my face. This story flows, there is no other way to describe it. So well-written that you don't notice anything gaps or breaks to jar you from your reading.I can't wait for Marcus' story but I think Zach will always be my favourite!

"There is so much going on in this book, I honestly don't know where to start! Okay, deep breath, here we go.First of all, Rissa - she is feisty, sassy, honest, truthful and forthright. I love her. When she literally tumbles into the lap of Spencer, she knows that she wants to know him more so goes for it. I loved this bit about her and, to be fair, Spencer was a real grump at this point in the book so when she refused to take his **** and met him head-on, I was cheering for her.Spence - wow, there is so much more to this guy than you originally thing. The quiet, geeky, artist man is just a faÁade. Trust me, as you read through this book, you will be amazed at the 180 he pulls, and you will be swept away with it just like Rissa was/is.There are lots of supporting characters in here too that each deserve a mention, but this isn't the Oscars, so I won't. What I will say is that each do their job very well, allowing you to get to know the main characters in different situations, without being overpowering.Our two main characters are 'real'! They have their faults, their ups and downs. One of my favourite bits of the book is when Rissa is curled up due to her monthly onslaught. I could so relate to this, I'm sure most women could, but it's not something usually written about. Spencer has a temper but Rissa isn't afraid of it. She knows that Spencer wouldn't hurt her, so gives him the space he needs to regain his equilibrium.The levels of mystery and suspense layer on as you read through. I think I know who the mysterious voice is, but I'm not saying as I'm sure I'll be wrong! There are just too many twists, turns and possibilities right now.Exceedingly well-written, with an intricate, interesting plot, smoothly paced and HOT, this was one enjoyable read!

"Jade is a demi-goddess - she has a god for a father and a demon for a mother. Not only that, but she has a curse from the Fates hanging over her and the Oneiroi hunting her. Jade isn't alone in this though, her four sisters share the curse and the circumstances. She can feel the darkness inside her growing and gaining control as the curse starts to awaken. She needs to find her 'balance' if she is in any way going to stop it from taking her over.This is a story that manages to be steamy whilst not actually describing anything in too much detail. There is lots of action as Nightmare - one of the Oneiroi - finds Jade and takes her to his realm. Fighting demons, zombies, poison-dart throwing monkeys, it's all in here.Smoothly written and with a fast but flowing pace, this is one to enjoy and from all indications, is the first of the series.

"I love the Songbird series. Melissa Pearl has managed to make each book individual to the characters involved, whilst still having other characters cameo in them for that added something special. We met Nessa in Josh and Rachel's book and I found myself looking forward to seeing where this quiet girl with a broken heart would go. Never did I imagine the journey I would take with her.I fell in love with both Nessa and Jimmy - they both have their faults and fears but they are perfect for each other. I think I spent at least half of this book blinking madly to get rid of my leaking eyes! Nessa has some serious issues to work out - both from her past and present. Jimmy is doing his best to make things right between them but has his own fears throwing spanners in the works, as well as Nessa's lack of trust (which was his own fault anyway!)Exceedingly well-written, with a smooth pace and enough feels to keep kleenex in business, I really can't recommend this highly enough.

"This is an interesting take on 'aliens' living amongst us. There are three basic castes within the Empyrian system - the Arcas, the Aguas and the Astras. Simply speaking, the Arcas are connected to nature, the Aguas control water, and the Astras are 'mental' (pun intended). There are also the Sparks but they are looked down upon by all of the above.The descriptions of these individuals, with the world they come from and inhabit, together with their responsibilities is in depth and detailed. The Forbidden that was mentioned was confusing to begin with, but became clearer as the book progressed, although you only got the full story when Evan is telling Scarlett the story near the end.Although I really enjoyed this book, I did feel a disconnection - and not in the way I thought. I was expecting to be slightly detached from the Empyrians, due to their very nature, but it was actually the connection between Scarlett and Petyr that just never seemed quite 'real' to me. I know that other reviewers will disagree as I have already seen some calling this one of the most romantic books they've read, but for me, it just didn't work.This is not saying that the story is inept or not enthralling, because it is. It just didn't quite hit the mark for me in that one respect.

"Prince Ben is beloved by his parents and can do no wrong. Princess Cecily is viewed as a curse and can do no right. The only problem is that they share a body! On even days, Ben is in charge, whilst Cecily 'rests'. On odd days, it is Cecily's turn. They have a bond which is looming on their twentieth birthday and no way of breaking it without dying. The King and Queen don't actually mind if Cecily dies, indeed they are working towards that, but Ben is not happy at all.I simply loved this book! It is so different and refreshing. Seeing how Ben and Cecily coped with their lives, and how completely different they were from each other, made this a magical read all by itself. But then you have the supporting characters of Alloran, Rowan, Lila, Rachael plus the mysterious tutors of Crispin and Jude.In other countries, multiple bonds are legitimate - romantic, physical, non-physical, friendship. The King and Queen have outlawed any bonds other than one male and one female. They will also only acknowledge the male or female sexes, anyone who feels differently has to keep it secret upon pain of death.This is an intricate tale, with layer upon layer of discoveries waiting to be made. I was completely enthralled as the story unfolded, but couldn't wait for the King and Queen to get their comeuppance.

"The third book in the series features Famine, otherwise known as Fami. Apart from Death, he is probably the busiest horseman but he seems to concentrate more on Africa, although he does go to different places too. Ekundayo has stolen a diamond from the mines in Botswana, but injures himself in the process, resulting in a visit by Death, who then instructs Famine on where to go. Famine rescues him and takes him back to his treehouse near Victoria Falls, where Death plays Devil's Advocate in telling Famine to leave Ekundayo alone and not tell him anything. The twist in this book isn't that Famine needs to forgive himself. He feels that he did nothing wrong as he was sacrificed by the village shaman to bring rain. Instead he has to forgive the shaman instead.This book is slightly different from the other two, in how Famine may return to being mortal, in the fact that him and Ekundayo argue and split up, going their own ways.Still well written and with few grammatical errors that I found, it has a smooth pace and leads nicely onto Death's book. I am also hoping that we will find out more about Lam and why he not only smells of Christmas but also of sulphur!

"This is another one where it is partway through the series, and I haven't read any of the previous books. However, although I would recommend reading these books in order, this is only so that you gain the maximum benefit from the stories. There were some parts, usually involving Brightwood and/or Nero, where I was a bit lost but that was with the overall story arc, not affecting THIS story.Taryn has a psychic gift that can harm and kill. An event happened when she was younger, and it has left her afraid - of herself, of her gift and of hurting others. This means that she leads a very lonely life, by choice, where she keeps everyone at a distance, even her son. As her story becomes clear, it is completely understandable why she reacted the way she did, and her character takes on a whole new side.Jared is a werewolf carpenter with his own issues. He is content with his life, and works around his phobia the best he can. He quotes on a new deck for Taryn but can't figure out the scent of werewolf he can smell in her house, when she is completely human. As these two slowly get together, things hot up - in more ways than one.The main thing that I loved about this book is that although we have the insta-mate thing going on, they move very slowly, learning about each other and figuring out ways to be together without hurting the other one. Of course, there is the usual chaos, controversy and miscommunication.A wonderful story that can be read as a standalone. Well-written, with a smooth pace, and few grammatical errors.

"This is the first book in a fantastic new series that I have loved every word of. This is a world of Immortals and mortals, where you can't die but you can be murdered, where the amount of power you have corresponds to how people react to you.Allie has lived an unconventional life so far, globetrotting with her parents but always alone. She has made few friends as most people seem to be uncomfortable around her. She no longer questions this, instead accepts it as inevitable. Just as she thinks she is making headway with a friend/boyfriend, her parents tell her they are moving again. This time she ends up in America. Whilst psyching herself up for starting a new school, she meets a boy called Aidan and a whole new world opens up for her.This is incredibly well-written and I was completely drawn into the story. I LOVED Allie and her sarcasm. She seriously made me snort out loud on more than one occasion, much to the amusement of my family. The interaction and banter between her and Aidan is fantastic. I will say this, I usually hate love triangles, and I mean loathe them! This somehow didn't seem like that though, and although I like Vince, I really REALLY don't want Allie to be with him. Trust me when I say I have fingers, toes and other body parts crossed for Aidan.If I had to say anything against this book, I would say that with the amount of characters involved, and their convoluted relationships/bonds, it sometimes made it a bit confusing to figure out just who was what in relation to whom. However, this is something very minor and quickly becomes irrelevant as you become more immersed in the story.I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this book and found it to be over far too quickly, even though it is a good sized book.

"After reading Emerge: The Awakening I immediately went online to see if book 2 had been released yet. Instead, I found Emerge: The Edge which is the prequel novella which gives a glimpse to Allie and Aidan's lives before they met. There is a bit of an overlap in time between the prequel and the main story, which helps to tighten up the story, give more depth to the characters (which were already in-depth anyway) and also help understand the reasons and objectives behind some of the decisions made in the other book.I loved Allie and Aidan in the full-length book, but to read these insights into them and their lives just makes me love them all the more. This is a story, and series, to get your teeth into and I have loved every moment.I'm afraid that I now have to stalk Melissa A Craven until I find out when the next book is due out!

"This book starts with Aldo 'waking up' after a successful attempt at killing himself, so to say he was a bit confused should be taken as given. He finds out that he is now Pestilence, the White Horseman. It is his job to go where he is sent and spread epidemics in order to keep the balance between Heaven and Hell. He was a doctor in his life, so it is both ironic and heartbreaking for him to now be spreading disease. In an effort to distance himself from the human population, he lives in the middle of the Amazon jungle. So you can imagine his surprise when he sees a man stumble into his clearing, full of fever and virus.Bart was left in the middle of the jungle by his lover and the rest of the research team. He doesn't know how he has made it to the clearing, but he is glad that he did when Pestilence looks after him, and helps him to make a long and slow recovery. Pestilence is riddled with guilt over the deaths of his wife and son due to the Bubonic Plague, and his 'job'. Bart comes into his life like a dervish and Pestilence starts to question if he can actually have a relationship.I thoroughly enjoyed the world building and characters in this book. It is the first of a new series, and I am looking forward to reading the others. Although I really liked Pestilence and Bart, I personally loved the scenes with Death, as I really enjoyed his dry wit and personality.With a relationship that grows and develops, as well as forgiveness, guilt, love, disease, this book is certainly worth the read.

"This book is the third in the Fated Mates series, and although I have not read books one or two, this in no way diminished my enjoyment.This is the story of Chloe, a witch who has grown up alone, and Kieran, the alpha Wolf burned by love in his past. Chloe tries to see the good in people, although when her and Kieran first meet, she has trouble finding any good with his attitude. Kieran thinks he knows what he needs to placate his pack, whilst not tying himself down with a mate he doesn't want.This is a well-told, well-paced story full of romance and sensuality. Our main female is prepared to stand up and fight for what she believes in, her best friend will tell her what she needs to hear, not just what she wants to hear.

"This is book 2 in the Keepers of the Veil series and, although I haven't read book 1, this in no way diminished my enjoyment of this book!Serenity is doing jobs which she wouldn't usually do, on duff information, as she tries to cooperate with her sister's kidnappers and get her sister returned safely to her. Alexi is there but Serenity doesn't know if it is to help or hinder her, but the sparks are flying from the outset.I loved how this was written from both perspectives. Serenity isn't just a ""woe-is-me damsel in distress"". She is a kick-ass alpha female who knows what she wants, and isn't afraid to fight for it. Alexi I loved - he has a darkness within him that is not surprising considering his 'job' but his love for Serenity shone through, even if he wouldn't admit to it out loud.Full of action and a twist that you may or may not see coming, this is a hot and fiery story that will definitely leave you wanting more.

The spirits of McKinton go missing, all at the same time, and it coincidentally at the same time as a Wiccan Coven visits and Sev gets a phone call from his sort-of estranged sister.Whilst the story itself is just as hot and entertaining as the others, I would have liked more about why the ghosts disappeared when they did, and why.

"This is the fourth book in the Blood Rose series, and I would recommend that you read these in order for the full impact. Although each story could be read as standalone (sort of), there is a general overall arc which makes more sense if you've read them all. Also, it's a wonderful series so there is no reason not to.This is Seth and Lorelei's book - both of whom we have met before. Poor Lorelei has so many different 'strands', it's a wonder she knows who she is! Seth is a loner by nature, but circumstances made him even more wary of letting anyone close. So maybe, just maybe, having someone close with so many different 'personalities' is a good thing? For me, that is a resounding YES! as I loved how they interacted with each other. Lorelei teasing Seth to get a reaction. Seth pretending to be grumpy to Lorelei, to make her smile. And I have to say too, that I loved the beginning of the book. To have our main female admit to loving the main male within the first six paragraphs was brilliant.I loved the depth and storyline to this book. I love this Realm more every time I visit.

"This debut novel from Hope Irving has characters from the 8th Century, as well as contemporary ones. There are a few flashbacks from Morgann, but mainly it is done as Virgil thinking, or occasionally writing, about things.There is a lot happening in this book, and yet paradoxically, nothing much seems to happen either. Rose is an unhappy character when we first meet as she has broken up with her first long-term boyfriend/relationship and has taken to cutting herself. Virgil is described as a sexy-ugly, nearly 7-foot giant. Unfortunately, because of the constant references to him being awkward and ugly, I kept on seeing Quasimodo in my mind!An interesting storyline that doesn't answer much, but instead leads you to the next book.* I received this book from Kiss Off Book Tours in return for a fair and honest review. *MerissaArchaeolibrarian - I Dig Good Books!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZEP2TAYVEY3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160IPO1K#wasThisHelpful","R2ZEP2TAYVEY3K","A3S0H2HV6U1I7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S0H2HV6U1I7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Banewolf is the second book in the Dark Siren series and it is a belter! The story continues where book 1 left off, although Kali has learned a new skill with regards to staying underwater. Rhane and Kali come back together again and life continues. It is hard for Kali to adjust, especially with all the changes and challenges she has faced and continues to face.There is action aplenty, and the story becomes more intricate as politics now plays a part. Kali is remembering more of her memories of when she was with Rhane in a previous life, and answers become clear on why certain things happened.Absolutely fantastic continuation that will leave you wanting more... immediately!

"The second book in the Hollow City Coven series continues where book 1 left off. Gillian and Shayne are together, sort of, as they travel to try and find more information about Tenebris. Gillian has a starting point, but the Midnight Market is not for the faint of heart.With a F/F kiss, and some steamy action from Gillian and Shayne, this book continues to be hot and steamy. However, this installment is also mysterious and suspenseful. It also comes complete with an ending that leaves  you wanting the next book in this series immediately.For everything that you do, there is a price to pay. Is Gillian's price for going to the Midnight Market going to be too high? I certainly hope not but I am looking forward to book 3 to find out.

"Danny has been feeling a tad out of sorts since Layla mated with Simon, and he's annoyed with himself for feeling that way. He wakes up with a strange woman in his bed, with a massive hangover and the worst morning breath he's ever had. Luckily for him, that doesn't put Quinn off, although she does have to leave him and doesn't think she'll see him again. Of course, as the reader, you have a pretty good idea that they will end up together (or at least you hope so) but the question is how.This book was simply amazing and I am going to be very careful with what I say so that I don't give away any spoilers. Trust me, every word is to be savoured and I would be doing you a grave injustice to give anything away.There is so much to this book - we learn more of Danny's history and how he feels (and why) about vampires; we learn about Quinn and her parentage, what it means and what effect that will have on her life; we also meet again with Layla and Simon, Connor and Raven, plus Ian and Kyleigh. I honestly can't wait for Cam and Claire's story but I will (im)patiently wait.Well written and with a smooth pace, Shattered Restraint is a delight to read and has no editing or grammatical errors that I found. With enough questions left to keep you invested in the series, but with enough answers given that you feel completely satisfied by the time you reach the end.

"This is a fast-paced and action-packed story involving Wraiths and Phoenixes, so straight away you have something slightly different from the norm in PnR.There is a whole new world here, just waiting to be explored. Where you have Oracles and Seers, Soldiers and Scholars. Where torture is not unknown and you can be bonded to someone against your will. From a heartbreaking start to a climatic finish, this book will hit pretty much every emotion as you read it. You will laugh at Aurelia and her sassy, take no prisoners, attitude. And then there is the banter between her and Evan, Rhys, West and the rest of the crew.I get the feeling that this book has only just scratched the surface of what is to come, and I for one, am definitely looking forward to learning more!

"Darren made his appearance as a new waiter in Virginia's cafe. He was extremely skittish and avoided eye contact with pretty much everyone. It's obvious he is on the run, but from what?! In Aftermath we learn his story, and boy, is it a good one. I loved how Darren grew in his self-confidence, once he realised that he actually had people he could call friends, and helped by Lee. The relationship between these two is hot and romantic.The other part that I loved about this book is that Connor, our long-term friendly (pesky) spirit, makes a new friend in Stefan. I absolutely adored this side-story!Laine and Severo are the main supporting characters in this book, although Zeke does get a quick mention.So very well-written, with a smooth storyline and pace. There were no grammatical errors that I found, although as I was completely entranced by this story, I might not have noticed them.This series is absolutely fantastic and I am thoroughly enjoying every book.

Harbin is Cavanaugh's younger brother and Aya was his first kiss before tragedy struck their village.This story was fantastic, with smooth writing, intricate twists and plenty of action. However, it was made all the more be the amazing characters, with their thirst for revenge and vengeance, and the atrocities they have survived which turned them into the people they are today.This is an excellent addition to the Eternal Mates series.

"This is the third book in the Wolfe Creek series and although it is not strictly necessary to have read any of the others before this one, I would recommend it as there was not much history about the main female character, although it was alluded to.

"This is a novella so expect it to be a quick read. However, it is also book 3 in the series, so you already have the world set and have a rough idea of what it's like. I'm afraid that this is part of the problem I had with the book. I know what Cascadia is like, how opinions can be divided, how there are three Shifter States. What I didn't understand (and didn't find out either) is why Charlie was sent off somewhere by herself, as a relatively inexperienced rookie, to catch a feral grizzly bear!!Kade and Daniel are a mated pair, looking for their third. They keep mentioning an 'Olivia', but you don't know who she is to start with, although you do later find out who she is and what her significance to them is. There are other questions raised about her though, which I am hoping will be covered if she has a story of her own.This novella is fast-paced so don't expect anything too deep.

"Let me start by saying that this book comes with a warning. If you have any triggers at all - PLEASE take note of that! This story covers subjects at kidnap, rape, torture, humiliation and degradation. If you don't like reading about any of those, then I suggest you try a different book! That being said, I thought that all of the above subjects were dealt with incredibly well. There was no 'overkill', if it was there, it was there for a reason and dealt with.Ice's story is horrific and I am full of admiration for this character to have both survived and coped with what she went through. Brain has his own issues but, to be fair, they are nothing like what Ice has had to deal with. She is his equal in so many ways and I loved how patient and caring he was with her.The paranormal aspect of this book almost takes a backseat to everything else. It is rarely mentioned apart from if his wolf is having a reaction to something. To be honest, I both loved and hated this. I love paranormal books with shifters so I was a bit disappointed. Although, I do feel that if it had been any more, it might have detracted from the overall story. Yes, I'm conflicted!

"Although this is the first in the Rolling Thunder Motorcycle Club series, it apparently has characters crossover from a different series, which I haven't read. Although this was in no way detrimental to the storyline itself, it did mean that I was glad when a bit more detail was given about who did what and where!This is a case of opposites attracting and for some reason, I could just never picture Gen and Duke together in my head. They are both well described but it just never gelled in my mind. I guess the most obvious reason is that Gen is so high maintenance and prissy in parts, that I just couldn't figure out how the two of them managed to stay together! Gen's reactions to some situations was over the top, that even with her history, just couldn't be quite explained away. In other cases, I loved her reactions and thought that she was sassy. Duke is called controlling in the synopsis, but I would also call him overbearing too. I liked him, but I would have kicked him into touch a few times!This is a long book but big chunks are taken up with the rules and regs of the MC, backstory and suchlike. Then other things come along and blindside you, like the fact that Duke and the MC were having trouble with the local cops, headed by Gen's ex! There was nothing even hinting at this.Overall, an enjoyable read.

"This book will take you on a stellar journey, not all of it nice, but all of it completely gripping. Marlena left her boyfriend three months ago after things made a turn for the worse. She has made the decision to get her life back under her own control, no one else's. One of the ways in which she does this is to make a major move to a new home, new city, new job. She starts her new job and literally falls for Elias, after she has walked into him! Marlena has a journey of discovery to embark upon as she has to learn to trust herself, and others, which trying to avoid getting hurt, if at all possible.I loved this book! You get it from the points of view of Marlena and Travis, who, I have to say, is an incredibly well-written villain. I don't like him, not one bit, but he is completely three-dimensional. He is a true brute and I can't abide him. Elias, Sin and Shelby are all intriguing characters and let me just say, I nearly threw my kindle at the wall!! To get so close to finding out their story and then for the book to finish... well, yes!For those of you that like your stories with a darker edge (like abuse or stalking for example), then I can highly recommend this story. A.M. Wilson reminds me of Alex Grayson for some reason, although I don't know why. Perhaps it is because they've both written exceptional stories in a hard-hitting genre.

"Everyone has heard of the lost city of Atlantis, but how many have heard of the last city of Tenebris? Tenebris is part of Wiccan history that has been relegated to myth and legend - which is actually hard to do when you can live for thousands of years. Gillian loves research and thinks that she has found a clue into where Tenebris actually is. She is determined to find it, but her Coven Master, doesn't want her to go alone. She is assigned a 'bodyguard' in the form of Shayne. Sparks fly between the two before they even know each other.This is a fast-paced romantic novella, with lots of action too. Wiccans have a very real enemy in the shape of Templars. Gillian appears to be more than she actually knows, so how do the Templars know about her already? What do they want her for? You are left with all these questions, but you still feel that you have started an excellent series.If you like Paranormal Romance, then I can definitely recommend this new series by Hazel Hunter, and I am definitely looking forward to book 2.* I received this book from the author in return for a fair and honest review. *MerissaArchaeolibrarian - I Dig Good Books!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IOM1UWMEJ48W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0165RFXBW#wasThisHelpful","R3IOM1UWMEJ48W","A3S0H2HV6U1I7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S0H2HV6U1I7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the debut novel of Jen Crane and she has started with a belter! There are some brilliant one-liners in here, and she has given a new meaning between a younger girl and an older man!So many characters in here to draw you in! Stella herself is cracking! She deals with life-changing events with attitude and aplomb, whilst committing herself fully. Gresham is simply gorgeous and I can't get enough of him. Timbra is sweet but with a sassy edge. Ewan - what can I say about him? He intrigues me and I can't wait to see where this story will take him.Well-written, smoothly paced, and laced with humour, this is a book to savour!

"Zeke was attacked when he came out. For fear of it happening again - either to himself or to those he loves - he has isolated himself and won't even go into his local town anymore. He is trying to run his ranch without having any dealings with the townspeople at all. His younger sister refuses to let him push her away, though, and through her, he meets Brendan. Now I am not a fan of insta-love, but I so desperately wanted Zeke to happy, this didn't bother me at all like it usually does. The romance is fast and hot but is also probably the only way that Brendan would be able to sneak past Zeke's defences.I really enjoyed this story! It was hot, sad, horrifying and romantic. The mischievous spirit, who only showed up when needed, was brilliant and, together with the reactions from the various people, made me laugh out loud on more than one occasion.The first book in a series, and I'm really looking forward to reading more.

"This is Cinderella with a twist. Instead of poor Cinders being all nice, we have one full of attitude and a 'woe is me' attitude. Now, don't get me wrong, Allie has had a rough time of it recently. She has lost her mother and her soon to be stepfather. Then along comes the wicked stepmother and the haughty stepsister, so she feels like she's entitled to have her very own pity party. She finally opens up the little black box which is the only thing she inherited, and goes off to find out what the address holds. What she finds is a tattooed and pierced fairy god... father who is determined to help her find happiness, even if he has to do it with her kicking and screaming.I'll be honest, I couldn't understand Allie's opinions about Angelo but understood the reasoning, and the lesson she had to learn, behind them. She has a lot of lessons to learn, not only about who she is, but how she views people, what will really make her happy, how she behaves towards others etc.This is a simple story, elegantly told, and it was very easy to slip between the pages and get carried away with the story.

"If you are looking for a Sci-Fi/Dystopian book that is chock-full of action, then look no further. The amount of action in this book will leave you breathless as you travel with Skye as she tries to save the people she has grown to care for.There isn't much of Skye and Brennan in this part, but trust me, there is so much else going on that you don't really miss it. Skye is such a strong character, I love her. She is prepared to put her neck on the line for what she believes in, even though it goes against everything she has been told her whole life. I love how she can already see the cracks in her society but just needs the back story for her to commit.Exceptionally well-written, fast-paced and action-packed, this is a story to read, savour, and then go back and read again, just to make sure you didn't miss anything!

"This book made me incredibly sad, at the same time, also making me want to scream with rage at the atrocities committed against this young man. The torture and degradation that he had to submit to is only made worse by the fact that these sorts of things have happened, and unfortunately, still do.This is an extremely well-written book, showing - but not glamorising - depression, PTSD, and self-harm to name but a few. All of these things Blue has to deal with on a daily basis. However, Brady also has to deal with them, as Blue is living with him. The characters are completely believable, whether it is Brady's calm that gets you, or Blue's immature temper tantrums. The fact of the matter is, they seem real. The characters, the situations, none of it seems false.This is the first book by D.P. Denman I have read, but after this book, I can tell you that it won't be the last.

"This is the fourth and final (so far) book in this series and what a journey it has been. I have been with Regina from the very start and hoped for a 'happy'ish ending for her. With everything that has gone on previously, I wasn't sure if a happy ending would be in the cards.Let me tell you, the whole series builds up to the Big Battle climax - not just this book. The evil dudes that have been causing trouble from the start, are still causing trouble, only it is now even deadlier than before. The Pack and Prides need to figure out how to move this forward, to become a single cohesive unit, that can face the oncoming battle and have some chance of winning.Now, unlike the other books, this doesn't come with a cliffhanger ending. Instead, it all ties up nicely whilst still leaving me with hope of a new story! I will say, at one point, I was getting a tad concerned over where the story was going. I won't go into details, suffice it to say that I've discovered my thinking is more Lykous than Tau (to begin with). How it all came to be though was just so right. I can't give you anything else than that but trust me, when you read these books, my cryptic comments will make sense but I really, REALLY, don't want to give anything away to spoil your enjoyment.I will say that this book had me in tears... AGAIN! Not only was I ugly crying for the last book, but this one got me too. All I will say Wendi and Deborah really know how to tie your emotions to a character, so if they get hurt, you hurt too.This is one of the most intriguing, interesting, complex, fascinating series I've read. If you like an alternate take on things, then I can HIGHLY RECOMMEND this series.

"O.M.G. Let me start by saying, if you thought the first two were full of emotion, ""you ain't seen nothing yet!"" I thought it was impossible for Loyalties to be topped, but it was by Uncivil Wars. Stupidly, I thought the same thing for this book - these are so good, surely they can't get any better? The only stupid thing with that sentence was me! Reclamations will grab every emotion you own and twist them until you are not sure how much more your battered heart can take, before it will take you even further.The Pack grows yet again, and it is proven beyond doubt, that this Pack is one of 'Blood and Spirit'. Who you are, or what you shift into, has absolutely no bearing upon the loyalty of your heart. Characters change and situations happen that they must react to, or instigate, for the better good.Jake, Selene and Collette wind tighter than ever, and you will waver between wanting one thing and another. My head was spinning as my opinion changed with every lead given by the authors. The best thing about this is that I never resented that. I was so totally immersed within the story, I was happy to go along with it.SPOILER ALERT - Something happens in this book that just about killed me. It's not at the end, so don't worry about that, but it completely sucker-punched me and I was in pieces with it for a long time. In fact, I don't think I have recovered yet!Totally and utterly fantastic and I can't wait for the fourth and final book in this series... if my emotions can cope!* I received this book from the authors in return for a fair and honest review. *MerissaArchaeolibrarian - I Dig Good Books!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OF02KFYCZCLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983210985#wasThisHelpful","R3OF02KFYCZCLV","A3S0H2HV6U1I7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S0H2HV6U1I7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the synopsis states, this starts about six months after Loyalties finishes. Life has sort of settled down for the Pack but that is all about to change. The catalyst for this is Cole as he decides he doesn't want to be without his wife any longer. He sets a ball rolling that will take you on a wild and emotion-packed story. The Pack continues to grow, with new characters like Selene, Jake and Collette, who have their own story to tell. We learn more about Diege and Olivia, their individual and joint pasts, decisions they have made and consequences that still need to be faced.Although this book is long - in fact, they all are - you will still be left wanting more. You won't realise just how long you've been reading, every interruption will be met with gritted teeth, and every opportunity to read will be grasped.The book leads up to a big climax that does, however, have a cliffhanger ending. Now before you think that this is a normal battle, just remember how the books are written. It is intense, real, gritty and dirty. It is exactly how you would imagine to be! It will make your heart pound faster, as your breath catches in your throat. Trust me, by the time it actually finishes, you will be glad for a rest, if only to get your pulse back to normal.Absolutely fantastic, thrilling and emotional, I really can't recommend this highly enough.* I received a copy of this book from the authors in return for a fair and honest review. *MerissaArchaeolibrarian - I Dig Good Books!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BZR1066JYD5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983210977#wasThisHelpful","R1BZR1066JYD5R","A3S0H2HV6U1I7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S0H2HV6U1I7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Regina turns up in Diego's care after her last pack wanted rid of her. She has a very large chip on her shoulder and as the story progresses, you find out exactly why. Regina is a prickly character to start with but, you know what, that absolutely suited her.I will admit, I thought I'd started the wrong book when I read the prologue but it all ties together perfectly. The character and world building in this book are second to none. Everything slots into place but not without difficulties arising from miscommunication, circumstances etc.One thing that I need to emphasise right now is just how good this shifter world is!! The ties that bind them are so strong. You learn a lot about 'pack life' and can imagine it being just this way. The explanations given on vampires, on how silver hurts the shifter, on how pack law rules are the only way, just fantastic!This is a chunky book which I am so thankful for!

Instead, I was very impressed with Tanner's reaction and subsequent research/knowledge, whatever you want to call it.I adored this book - every single word.

This in no way diminished my enjoyment of the book as I was able to completely understand the story, and backstory, without any prior knowledge.What I will say is that I now want to read the first two!This is a paranormal romance with a high element of creepiness! Phantoms is a paranormal fright show where they go and investigate things that go bump in the night. This one hits close to home though as it is in Sammy's hometown, with a story she heard about all her life, with a personal tragedy thrown in too.The chemistry between the two main characters jumps off the page at you.

Nora is an aristocrat who fell from the graces of her family when she married for love. Together these two are central to a plot to use Truth Powder on the Prince and restart a war.This is a smoothly written, well-rounded historical romance with paranormal aspects. I love all the characters and thoroughly enjoyed the banter between Stanstead and Westfall. I also enjoyed catching up with Lady Cassandra, as she continues her life with Stanstead. This is such a brilliant set of characters, I would be hard pressed to say which one is my favourite.The descriptions of Bedlam were horrible, but I'm sure no where near as bad as they could have been.

Annabelle is determined to make her own way through life, and stand on her own two feet. She is refreshingly direct, and does not play games. The interactions between these were hot, albeit I did get whiplash from Kaden a couple of times.This is well-written and steadily paced, there are moments of sweetness, balanced by downright sexiness!

"This was a tricky book to get into - mainly because I couldn't 'relate' to Senza at the beginning. For all she was 'cream of the crop', I mainly thought her to be self-centred. As the story progresses, she does change as she faces certain realisations and events. Once you do get into the story, you will be turning the pages with interest as she goes through different experiences and meets with various people who make impacts upon her life.Now, this may sound wrong, but I absolutely loved the last few chapters! Not because it was nearly the end, but the caring and compassion that Senza shows, the twist that is revealed (although it wasn't really a twist), and a new chance that is unveiled.If you like historical novels with a twist, and lots of Edgar Allen Poe quotes, then I can definitely recommend this.

Their family unit is a strong one and they have a lot of love and respect for each other, although that doesn't stop the ribbing that takes place.I really enjoyed this book as Drannon may hide behind his cowboy's persona, but he is a romantic at heart. Lacey has no resistance to this and, let me tell you, my heart melted too. Well written, with a smooth pace, and enough about Abe and Sera so I knew what had happened to them, I was immersed in this story and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who likes romance, with a dash of cowboy!* I received this book from the author in return for a fair and honest review. *MerissaArchaeolibrarian - I Dig Good Books!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTDB9IYH1YDBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKWTXM0#wasThisHelpful","RTDB9IYH1YDBD","A3S0H2HV6U1I7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S0H2HV6U1I7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a short but sweet novella that tells a snippet of Abe and Sera's story. Sera has just found out that she is barren and unable to give Abe the children they have both dreamed about. With problems on the ranch and her husband about to leave on a business trip, the timing does not seem right to break the news. However, Abe has been with Sera since High School and so knows that something is wrong. Will these two be able to share the secret that lies between them?This is exceptionally well told and will tug at the heart-strings. It is the first book in the Crawley Creek series that I have read and I am completely looking forward to reading more. The love that flowed off the pages was almost tangible, especially considering the circumstances.

"This is the second book in the series although I haven't read the first one. Whilst you can read this as a standalone, I personally would recommend that you read the first one before this, just to give you an idea of what has gone on before. You do get a good idea though, so like I said, this is not necessary.The relationship between Brye and Josh is one that has been there for years. They knew each other as children and it changed as they grew. Brye 'had her heart broken' by Josh when he pushed her away after their first kiss. Now Brye is a 'beautiful' woman, the beauty of her sisters apparently, and is used to getting what she wants from men so Josh's refusal hurts her.Fast forward to the present time and Brye is going through a personal crisis as she has been disfigured by a Warlock, using a form of magical acid that has eaten away at a wound on her face. This brings about a personal epiphany as she hears from others what they thought of her - self-centred and selfish are just a couple of the descriptions used.This is a steady book that follows Josh and Brye as they try to get their friendship back. They do jump into bed rather quickly which I was a bit disappointed about but then it becomes part of the story and something else that Brye has to realise.Well-written with enough action to keep you interested.

"Reading is the most important ability that defines a kid's future. If they can't read really well by grade four, their whole academic future is at risk.

Then, we read the rest of the book in the zoo while stopping by the various exhibits in our local zoo.

"The story of Sharise Sills, a fictional character in Dennis Butler's novel Indigo Tears, is presented in this companion short-story as a first person narrative, a journal that Sharise started writing on the day of her capture.An ordinary afternoon and what seemed like a routine request for directions from a driver of a van on a busy street started Sharise's descent into what she refers to as Hell. For thirteen years, she was held in captivity, treated like a slave of the historical past that she was so well aware of, and abused physically and emotionally. But instead of giving up in what seems like a desperate situation, Sharise chooses to fight back. Her struggle is described in this audiobook exceptionally well, both by Dennis Butler's wonderful writing and by excellent narration of Stacy Towles. The ending does not disappoint.

"Would you consider the audio edition of Easy Guide to the Tarot to be better than the print version?It's best to have both because there's a lot of information to absorb, and the print/kindle version can be a good reference guide while the audiobook can be used for a general overview and as a refresher.What other book might you compare Easy Guide to the Tarot to and why?I haven't seen other audiobooks on Tarot cards.

I love the humor, dark as it may be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX9A0L0Z17VHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AN01GW#wasThisHelpful","RX9A0L0Z17VHH","A3IJ6GEIHO9UO3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IJ6GEIHO9UO3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A great guide to common Latin phrases and expressions that we encounter in literature and everyday life. Reading this book gave me a better appreciation for the English language and the myriad of connections between English and Latin. If you're looking for a grammar guide, this is not the book for you.

"Great duo! I've always been curious about the phrase ""mind the gap."" Apparently, it's applicable in far more situations than a train ride. Paying attention to the present is essential to happy and happy living, but many of us can't seem to master ways to do it. We focus on the past or on the future instead of on the moment and...fall through the cracks. These two books give easy to follow, simple suggestions about ways to stop/minimize the mental noise, become more productive and more effective.

"One of my colleagues raises her own chickens and often shares the eggs with us. They taste so good! Much much better than the ones you can buy in a store, and they are healthier because she controls what she puts in the food that she gives to the chickens. I've been intrigued with the idea of having chickens in my own backyard for a while, and that's why I got this book. While my colleague shared some of her experiences with me here and there, this book provides a much more logical and systematic approach to raising chickens.

"Sometimes, my family and I can't decide whether we want to vacation in a city, in the wilderness, hike, or sight-see and learn about history. Sweden can be the perfect place. Norrland offers plenty of wilderness to explore, with mountains, rivers, and great hiking. And it's not far at all from other areas of Sweden, from the bustling city life of Stockholm to intriguing ancient history of Uppsala.

"A friend of mine has been talking about the wonders of wheat grass juice all summer, so I decided to read more about it. The first three chapters of the book explain the problems of our everyday life that cause us to feel tired, unwell, sick, etc., and create the need for herbal remedies, such as wheat grass juice. The following chapters discuss the benefits of wheat grass juice from a scientific point of view (but written for a general audience, easy to read), ways to grow wheat grass, how to get juice from it, how much to drink, and how wheat grass juice can help with a varieaty of health conditions. The discussion of wheat grass as an important source of chlorophyll was very interesting to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25FF6E38RKZKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSQL7TG#wasThisHelpful","R25FF6E38RKZKT","A3IJ6GEIHO9UO3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IJ6GEIHO9UO3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had no clue I suffered from tinnitus until my husband started complaining about his ears ringing a few years ago and we did some reading about it!  I thought this high pitched constant sound in my head was normal and just grew to live with it.We tried a similar product for my husband a couple of months ago with marginal results though it has helped him some in the month he's been using it.Then, I had an opportunity to try Tinnitivix through a promotional offer to see how it worked and review....this time for ME!I've been taking this faithfully for about a week and a half twice a day and I'm pretty amazed...I'd say that the ringing has reduced so far by about 30% and I'm really encouraged to keep using this to see if I can eliminate it totally!I'm not sure which ingredient is working or if its the combination of what is in this, but I'm pretty surprised it helping so much!I take several supplements anyway so frankly I wasn't expecting this to really do much but I'm glad I was wrong about that.I will update this review after a month or so to let you know if it has eliminated the issue entirely but so far I'm pretty happy to have at least SOME of the annoying noise gone.I really didn't realize how bad it was until it started going away!  I feel bad for anyone with a worse issue than mine as I've now discovered some people are about driven nuts by the sound :(So the bottom line is, if you have this issue, you have nothing to lose to try this and see if it helps...I'm REALLY glad I found this stuff and am hoping it continues to improve the condition :)Hope this was helpful :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM7PPPRR18WKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HKFBJWQ#wasThisHelpful","RM7PPPRR18WKG","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Once I found I didn't have any adverse reactions, I switched over to the Lumen 500mg to continue my experiment.Taking one twice a day before meals as recommended for the past several weeks I've had no issues with upset stomach or jitters.While I have not lost any additional weight, I also haven't gained any and I've been eating some things I should not ;)My energy level has improved and it feels like I'm processing food quicker and don't get the cravings for no no's like I used to!I've not noticed anything dramatic but I will continue with this until I finish the bottle.Overall, I'm happy with the results so far and will likely continue with this for a few months to get a better idea of how it's working :)I received this product at a discount to evaluate and give my honest opinion :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLKX1CFI5NPHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCXNYD0#wasThisHelpful","RLKX1CFI5NPHO","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This may be one of those items you don't think you need until to have them!  Yes, they work great to tie down things with handles that you don't want scratched, but there are more uses for these :)We do a lot of camping/backpacking and sleep in hammocks so we are always looking for strong, light weight tree straps to suspend the hammocks.I got these through a special promotion at a discount to test out and give my honest opinion and feedback-otherwise I probably would not have bought them, BUT....We started testing these out for various uses around the farm and also for hanging our hammocks and found they are really useful!For hammocks, sometimes you need a little extra length on the straps to hang depending on the design of the hammock.  These straps proved to be a perfect solution without  much weight!  Also, if you are hanging a  hammock on small trees, these can be used with just a simple slip through one end and a carabeener!These are a great solution for when you need to secure gates, enclosures and even attaching tie downs in the back of a truck for hauling hay!I'm sure we will find more uses the longer we use them but for now, I'm really glad we got these and they have proved to be pretty handy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4SCCKJVCCCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DSUGWO#wasThisHelpful","R4SCCKJVCCCV","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They look like regular tights but the inside is a wonderful, velvet soft fleece that is SO warm but still light weight and not at all bulky!I'm 5'2"" and 160 lbs and these fit perfectly with a little extra length to tuck into boots.You can't tell from the photo, but these have a texture to them - like a cable knit sweater - which is subtle but adds just enough interest to make them a little more stylish than your average, boring leggings!I'm getting a few more colors in these since they are really a good value and good quality :)Without hesitation, I recommend these!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AYG2EXSJRGQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017FE8ID4#wasThisHelpful","R1AYG2EXSJRGQD","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third shredded memory foam pillow with bamboo cover that I've purchased recently and I'm really sold on how well these work.  The shredded foam does a much better job of conforming to your body than formed foam as there is more give but still lots of support!For anyone with back, hip or knee issues that needs to sleep with a pillow between their knees or have support up against the back for side sleepers, this pillow is fantastic!First, it is LARGE!  Like, wow, I was shocked how large once I unwrapped it and it decompressed!  It's almost the length of our Cal King bed but not so wide to where you can't work it around your body to get comfortable - unlike a standard King sized pillow which is what I was using.My only negative on this particular pillow is the cover...The first bamboo covered pillow (king size) is from another brand and the cover on that one is SSSOOO soft!  I've never felt anything like it!  I was so happy with it, I bought another in Queen size for my husband since he kept stealing mine!  It was yet another brand from the first one and the pillow was fine, but the cover was nothing like the first - still soft but not as soft as the King size :(Then, I discovered THIS one through a promotion to test out and review and was excited to buy this since I had been looking for a body pillow in shredded memory foam with the bamboo cover!Unfortunately, though the pillow itself is great, again the cover is nothing like the first one I bought that is so amazingly soft :(So my experience with these type of pillows is the quality of the covers varies greatly from company to company.  Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing pillow and, if I hadn't experienced the first one I bought with the super soft cover, I probably would never have noticed!So....overall, this is a wonderful pillow and, yes, the cover is still nice and soft - much nicer than cotton - but it's not the holy grail of pillow covers like my first one.I still would highly recommend this pillow for those looking for a super comfortable body pillow :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20YMNLBE8OPE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015G77Z2C#wasThisHelpful","R20YMNLBE8OPE4","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having excessively dry and sensitive skin, I'm always looking for products like this with few ingredients, natural and organic and that will moisturize my super dry skin.In the past, to get enough moisture in my skin - especially my hands - I had to resort to petrolium based products.I ran across this product through a promotion that allowed me to purchase it at a discount to test and review :)Wow!This is certainly a thick product and is, in fact, a balm - not a creme or lotion.  I mention this so you know this is the very thick product.in spite of the weight of this balm, it absorbs quickly into my skin!My hands get SO dry from working outdoors all day and I have to be careful what I use because I'm sensitive to so many ingredients.This truly is the most soothing, moisturizing product I've found to date which leaves my skin calm and full of moisture!I can only imagine how well this would work on infants and their tender skin :)Calendula is very soothing to irritated skin and this also contains lavender.  It absorbs well and doesn't leave the skin greasy :)I would recommend this to anyone with an infant with ouchy skin AND to adults!!!!Lovely product :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MXBFOHM1QXOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ONHVBI#wasThisHelpful","R1MXBFOHM1QXOC","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We had been looking to get one of these for a while for using as a light weight wash basin for when we backpack.  With backpacking, the weight of your gear really matters!This is a well made, decent design, right size for the price.  8L is plenty big enough to wash clothes or cooking utensils but still small and light enough to not be too bulky for the pack.On the photos I've added, I put a standard sized can inside so you can get an idea of size.It does well with standing upright when filled with water and did not leak.The only complaint I had was the valve for filling the rim with air is a little hard to operate and could use some tweaking.Other than that, it's working well so far and was just what we were looking for!I was able to purchase this at a promotional price to test out and review :)Hope this was helpful info!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBVWQ4H3S2JK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6T6Y08#wasThisHelpful","RBVWQ4H3S2JK4","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have purchased quite a few backpacks over the past few years for various uses since we do a lot of hiking and backpacking.The reason we chose this one is we were looking for a smaller, lightweight pack to keep on the car for an emergency pack.  Since we are in the woods nearly every weekend, having an additional pack full of emergency supplies in the car in addition to the packs we carry was something we needed to do for a while.Through a special promotion, I was able to buy this pack at a discount in order to test it out and review...Really, I wasn't expecting this to be GREAT because of the price but we have been nicely surprised at the quality and function of this little bag!We got the 20L and it is the PERFECT size to fit everything we needed to put in there for an emergence in case we get stranded in the woods.This easily fits a sleeping bag, first aid kit, MRE's, extra water, poncho, emergency tent, flares, etc. and it fits easily in the tire well of my RAV4.There is no chest strap like with many of the bags we already own, but that is a very simple fix with a strap we already had around.Overall, this is a sturdy, well made, well priced bag!  If you are looking for a bag for your car or for day hiking, this is a really good choice :)Hope this was helpful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q9P2VU9YBQ0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151NK7U8#wasThisHelpful","R2Q9P2VU9YBQ0K","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a hard core coffee drinker..like...STRONG coffee...my teeth started getting darker :(  The problem is I have VERY sensitive teeth and gums and was not able to use the whitening system I got from my dentist since it caused way too much pain to my teeth (AND was very expensive)I ran across this set on a special promotion and was able to buy it at a discount to test and review...First time I used it, I held my breath while putting the trays in and waited for the burn!hhhhmmmm...no burning pain!I suspect it's because the formula is not as strong as the kind I got from my dentist which was GREAT, actually, since I needed a milder solution that would still work...After just a few days, I already noticed my teeth were quite a bit whiter!Some helpful tips on using this kit:Use a SMALL amount!  You do NOT want to totally fill up the tray since it's a waste PLUS you want to keep as much off your gums as you canAlso, if you already have a custom tray set you bought through your dentist like I did, USE THAT!  The trays that came with this set are fine, but I didn't use them since the set from my dentist is custom fit to my teeth.DO use the included remineralization treatment along with this to avoid further sensitivity!So, overall, for the price, this is a great product that works and lasts quite a long time if you are careful how you use it! :)Happy whitening!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYHFG6YZJ3CP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TNXPCNU#wasThisHelpful","RYHFG6YZJ3CP8","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, so...I'm a little long in the tooth to be going to Rave parties!  It wasn't until AFTER I bought these I found out why they are so popular!!!  LOL!Actually, I got these for camping and backpacking!We need a few of these to put in our emergency supplies but also for our camping and backpacking gear as they make great emergency lights!You can also use these to tie on a weighted fishing line for night fishing and they work GREAT.We also tucked a few in drawers in various locations in the house in case the power goes out to have some light to find flashlights by :)The other thing I'm using these for is to attach to our small dog's collar for night time potty runs so we can see her when we are camping!  Just tucked one into the loops on her collar and we can see her from quite a ways awayFor the price, this is a bargain for 200 of them!May take us a while to use these, but I'm happy to have gotten them :)I bought these at a promo price to test out and review :)Love these and, if I decide to crash my grandkid's dance party...well...I'm hip then ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFFRZU2381JN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01709J9VY#wasThisHelpful","RFFRZU2381JN4","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 2 pack infusion bottle set is a great buy!  I purchased these as a gift for a newlywed couple who are into health and fitness and they LOVED them!  The simple, sturdy design is the perfect size to fit in most cup holders in cars which many of these type of bottles are just too big!I especially like the bottom infusion part which makes it easier to refill than the type that screw onto the top of the inside of the bottle.We threw in a couple of ""S"" type carabeeners in the box since I know this couple likes to hike - that would be a nice addition to an already great product if the company is reading these reviews ;)The other thing I liked about this set is they are not too heavy.  Very sturdy, but not heavy like some of these bottles can be.The pop top is great for keeping things from spilling without having to unscrew the top.This is an all around great bottle that really makes a super gift - one for the office - one for home :)I was able to purchase this set at a promotional price to test and review and I certainly give this one two thumbs up!!!Hope this was helpful info :)Happy sipping!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28KIJ4QLKK1NZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WV7B2V6#wasThisHelpful","R28KIJ4QLKK1NZ","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would not have dreamed something like this (kinda looks funny on!) would actually WORK!  Color me surprised! :OSo, sitting at a computer for long periods really causes problems with my neck.  I have an inversion table that I use all the time but it just does not do as much for my neck as I would like.When I ran across a promotion for this product and had a chance to buy this at a discount to test out and review, I figured it was worth a shot!So, the way it works is you put this around your neck and pump up the little blood pressure like pump until it inflates enough to start giving your neck a comfortable stretch!They recommend when you first start using this to only leave it inflated for a few minutes to start so, the first test drive only lasted about 4 minutes.  However, in just those few minutes, i could right away feel the pressure lift off of my neck and my headache subside!  AMAZING!I also have one of those cervical stretch pillows you lay on the floor and drape your neck over the back but it doesn't come close to helping as much as THIS gizmo!I'm now using this a few times a day and right before bed and it has helped SO much.  I'm pretty surprised since I didn't honestly expect much from this.  Imagine how many pounds of pressure the weight of your head puts on your spine - especially your neck - and how being able to decompress the neck - even a little - helps to relieve that pressure!I'm totally sold on this and have actually loaned it out to a couple of gals my husband works with who have terrible neck problems and they both are ordering their own now!  Thankfully, I got it back from them ;)You have nothing to lose to try this.  It may not help, but there's a bigger chance that it will!

"I bought these for my husband for a pair to carry in the boat for fishing so I didn't want to spend a ton of money but wanted a decent pair of sport glasses for him.These actually aren't bad for the price!

"I'm not sure why some have said this is a badly made chair!  I found it to be just what we were looking for in a lightweight, outdoor chair with a back!Just to be clear though, I'm short - 5'2"" and so this fits me perfectly!  My husband, who's 6' sat in it and it was a little too close to the ground for him but said he would still use it if no other chair was available in the woods! LOL!The chair folds up easily to carry and all of the components seem to be well made for the price point of this product.  What I feel isn't made well is the bag it comes in for carrying the chair.  It's thin and already fraying so we ditched that bag and found one we had around that is made better and use that to carry the chair in.  Not a problem for us since we always have extra carrying bags around but could be a deal breaker for some folks.The other thing that was a little negative is, when I first took this out of the box, the strong chemical smell almost knocked me over!I just left it out on the patio for a few days to air out and it is fine now but for someone who wants to use this right away, you may find this issue unpleasant.I found this to be a perfect solution for us because I wanted a small, lightweight chair WITH A BACK that we could take with us on our day trips to the woods and didn't want to always pack our big, zero gravity chair!This one is small but sturdy and it actually pretty comfortable because of the back.  No arm rests but then you are talking about a much larger thing to have to pack around.Overall, I like this little chair a lot and have found we use it quite a bit now for our day trips :)  I think for the price and the quality you can't go wrong on this one.  It would be nice if they worked on the quality of the carrying bag :)We received a promotional discount on this to test out and give our honest opinion and feedback :)Hope this was helpful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LJGBNZBK6F36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WLZJ0J4#wasThisHelpful","R2LJGBNZBK6F36","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not only a really well made, functional bottle but beautiful as well!  I own several water bottles and none are as nice as this one :)This comes with 2 straws for attaching to the extra top which allows the bottle to be used in a sipping fashion as well as the regular screw top.The attached carabeener is lightweight but sturdy enough to hang from a backpack.I like the 32 oz size as its enough water for a full day hike without being too heavy.  We bought two of these.  This beautiful red one and also a silver one and both have performed perfectly - no leaks and are holding up well to continual use.We could not be happier with these!I would not have even found this brand had it not been for a promotion which allowed me to buy these at a discount in order to test out and give my honest opinion and feedback!Without a doubt, I recommend this bottle and any of the Swig Savvy products! :)Hope this was helpful info!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SU00PWVPHK2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147JL6C0#wasThisHelpful","R1SU00PWVPHK2V","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted to try this scrub specifically for my hands!  I work outside ever day and my hands get SO rough and dry and no amount of thick hand creme can help sometimes.  Without exfoliating, moisture cannot easily penetrate the skin.As a disclaimer, I have VERY sensitive skin and VERY dry skin, so my situation is not typical when it comes to skin care products!  I only mention that because, what irritates MY skin may not bother most folks.What I have to do several times a week is, in the shower I use a pumice stone on the palms of my hand to help with callous buildup.  Again, I'm working outdoors all the time so my hands get rough :(I think it's because of the pumice stone use that this body scrub burned my skin!  Of course, it IS salt so if you have any areas on your body where you have a cut or your skin is raw, it likely will burn :)So after rubbing well into my hands and rinsing, I noticed my skin was softer :)  My personal preference would be to have a little bit more of something in it to make it a little more abrasive as the salt dissolved very quickly.Overall, I like it!  I can deal with the burning because that's just my skin and it goes away.

"First, let me say I'm sort of...well, ok..I'm a hard core PILLOW COLLECTOR! Because of issues with my neck and back, I've been on the hunt for ""THE"" pillow that will work for me for years. So, I have amassed a collection of 11 pillows - everything from the buckwheat, memory foam with gel, down and even the newest My Pillow. Nothing has really worked well and I end up switching out pillows several times a night trying to get comfortable.What I've been searching for is a pillow that isn't bulky, low profile and that can be ""formed"" around my shoulder as I'm a side sleeper. So many of the pillows I've tried while thin enough, simply don't hold their shape and end up going flat after an hour or so. The thicker, fluffier pillows end up being too bulky which holds my head too far up off the pillow causing neck pain....UGH!If you are one of those people who can sleep on any pillow, God bless you! You have no idea how fortunate you are!I was offered an opportunity to try this pillow through a promotional offer to test out and give my honest opinion and feedback and, after reading about it, was excited to give it a try. What was one more pillow?! I'm more than willing to be a guinea pig, especially when it comes to a product I'm on the hunt for anyway.Once I got the pillow unwrapped in its very tight wrapping, I watched it decompress into a normal looking, queen sized pillow but that's where the ""normal"" part ended and wonderfulness began!!!I wish I could properly describe how amazingly soft this pillow is! The cover of the pillow alone is worth the price of admission! There is a very different feel to this fabric that, until you touch it, just looks like normal cotton but feels incredible! It's the first pillow I've ever had that I DIDN'T want to put a pillowcase on!! The great thing is that the cover can be removed and washed so I elected to use it without a pillowcase just because it feels SO amazing.Since it was mid day when this arrived and I had not slept well the night before, I decided it was a perfect opportunity to test drive it by taking a quick nap :)Though this is not a thick pillow, I noticed that there is plenty of support without being too bulky. There is just enough ""give"" to the filling to be able to sort of mold it around the shoulder and neck area and it holds it shape!I really only intended to take a quick 20 minute nap, but ended up falling SOUND asleep and didn't budge from my original position for 2 1/2 hours!!!This may not sound exciting to you, but for someone who wakes frequently with neck pain, it was right up there with a miracle!!!Upon close inspection of this pillow, the quality of construction is pretty amazing - not always the case with pillows even the very expensive ones.Since I thought may it was just a fluke that I slept a solid 2 1/2 hours without waking to make pillow adjustments, I tried it again that night and had the best night's sleep I've had in literally years.So, in conclusion, I can say without bias that this truly is the BEST pillow I've EVER used and will be buying a couple more!!! The crazy thing is, this is not an expensive pillow to start with - $22 for a good quality, queen sized pillow is VERY reasonable when you compare it to many out there on the market that make the claim that they are the worlds softest, most comfortable, etc....All I can say is TRY IT! You have nothing to lose since it has a money back guarantee.If you have ANY trouble with sleeping because of pillow issues you will not be disappointed with this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VSX6PQHYCSIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AVRYSI#wasThisHelpful","R2VSX6PQHYCSIT","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With colder weather here, I had been looking for leggings that were a little thicker since my legs freeze in leggings - even with a long sweater!I didn't realize they even made fleece lined leggings until I stumbled on these through a promotion!  I was afraid they would be too thick as it's hard to tell from the photo.Actually, these are quite a nice surprise!  They look and feel like regular leggings until you put them on!  There is a light weight, fleece lining on the inside that adds just the right amount of warmth without bulk!!!The sizing fit perfect with a little extra length on me (but I'm 5'2) which is fine since I tuck them into boots.LOVE these and I'm going back to buy other colors!Through the promotion, I received a discount to try these and give my honest opinion and, YES I recommend these!Good quality - good price - warm legs :)Hope this was helpful :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROSMJ6APAV6BU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160VVEXY#wasThisHelpful","ROSMJ6APAV6BU","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With so many devices requiring USB charging and many of these devices also requiring you use your own charger, its nice to have a few of these around!  We actually only had one or two for all of our stuff and found we were constantly looking for them.These Spark Wireless plug ins are a great economical solution and you will find you use every one of the 5 that come in this set!What I did was put one in various locations around the house and one in my purse for travel since they are small and light weight :)This gave me the idea to get these as stocking stuffers since I'm sure I'm not the only one who finds having several of these very helpful!Sounds silly but I probably would not have thought to buy this 5 piece set had I not come across a promotion to be able to buy these at a discount to try out and give my honest opinion!That being said, I can certainly recommend these and suggest for the price, the quality and value is very fair!Hope this was helpful info :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LDG0J4MO73W1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DWGLMEW#wasThisHelpful","R2LDG0J4MO73W1","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have close to a dozen different types of hammocks that we use for a variety of things - backpacking, camping, backyard use, etc. - and almost an equal number of tree straps.  Just so you know we have a bit of suspension experience :)This is a rare example of ""TRUTH IN ADVERTISING"" - Meaning Cherokee Outfitters claim regarding these being ""HEAVY DUTY"" and extra long is an UNDERSTATEMENT!!!When we first opened the package and looked at these, I thought for a second we were sent a set of seat belts by mistake!The quality of these tree straps is above and beyond and are more than adequate for suspending the heaviest loads....um..sorry..no offense intended in calling any fellow hammock dwellers heavy loads!The material literally looks and feels just like seat belts and, in fact, if you were camping and got your vehicle stuck in the mud and needed to pull it out, you could use these straps and not worry about breaking them!The length is indeed extra long, allowing for use with even the largest of trees...well..excluding giant California redwoods of course...The metal rings and carabeeners are extra strong and heavy duty as wellSo...for backyard hammock use and camping, these are awesome.  The only situation we would not suggest using these for would be ultralight backpacking simply because of the weight - for those mindful of gear weight, you'd want to use a whoopie sling or ultra strong paracord.We would not have known about these had we not been given the opportunity to try these through a promotion to test drive and share our honest opinion and without hesitation give these TWO BIG THUMBS UP!!! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AB3QP7HP95ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JVJXRG#wasThisHelpful","R2AB3QP7HP95ER","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure what the issue is with other folks with this holster but I find it to be really nice quality and it works great for my needs!  The holster is sturdy, good quality leather.  The construction is above average for a reasonably priced holster like this.I have a leather top fold case on my iPhone 6 plus that is not really bulky so I found that, with that case on my phone, it fits in this holster snugly.Some have mentioned that there wasn't a belt loop or clip on the back but there IS indeed both!  You can either slide your belt through the ""loops"" on the back or use the clip to hook it to your pants or belt.Personally, I'm using this holster to clip to my backpack for hiking and also for hooking to my waist band for keeping my phone protected while working in the barn.So far, it's been the perfect solution for what I needed and I'm really happy with the quality and function :)I'm not sure why others are having issues with this unless they received the wrong case.

"For the price, I had certain expectations of how the quality would be on this robe.  I'm kind of a robe COLLECTOR!  LOL!  I have over a dozen and I like them to fit a certain way and the fabric needs to be plush.  I always buy men's robes because they are usually longer and more roomy - not that I'm a large woman (5'2"" size 12) but I like plenty of robe and women's robes never are ""blankety"" enough for me!I bought this in the M/L size and it's PERFECT!  Ya, my husband could fit in this but he has his own!  Of course, the sleeves are too long, but I just roll them up and it's not a problem.I've paid much more than this for robes and really, the quality is very nice on this robe for the price!  It's not as thick as many of my others, but I didn't expect it to be.I've laundered it and it washes up really well.  As with any of these plush robes, DON'T dry them in a hot dryer!  They lose their softness!  I always run my robes on Medium in the dryer for only about 20 minutes then hang it to dry the rest of the way.  It really preserves the fabric.I was able to purchase this at a discount in order to try it out and give my honest opinion and feedback and YES I can certainly recommend this robe!Hope this was helpful :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2APAQZ3QUUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016R4ALLK#wasThisHelpful","R1L2APAQZ3QUUJ","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a hairstylist, I'm always on the lookout for new and great products to try!  This hair mask was offered through a promotion where I had an opportunity to test it and give my honest opinion and feedback :)First, I love the packaging!  The jar comes in a nice box with clear instructions for use :)It takes very little product to do the job...Just a small amount worked fine for my shoulder length, rather thick hair.  I was initially concerned that it would simply coat the hair without penetrating and actually conditioning the hair but not the case here!The product works into the hair really nicely and detangles really well.The real wonderfulness happens when you dry and style your hair and see the shine and silkiness emerge!  The hair feels SO good, even just air drying leaves the hair soft and silky but drying with a round brush really leaves the hair extra smooth :)My ONLY dislike about this product is the really strong, floral fragrance which, to me, is a bit overwhelming.  I think they could cut the fragrance by half and still have a nice smell.  The other thing is the bright, blue color.  Personally, I prefer not to apply artificial color to my body and, again, I think they could do without it in this great product.Overall, I would buy this again and recommend it with the heads up about the strong fragrance...many people are very sensitive to smells and would miss out on the benefits of the product because of this :)Hope this was helpful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU0WJNQHKSURK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163RKRGK#wasThisHelpful","RU0WJNQHKSURK","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a great invention!  Of course, in some cultures, these have been around for years but it's new to me!  I thought this would be a helpful thing to have around when the grandkids come to save my back!The fabric is SO soft with just enough stretch to have a little give without losing support for the child you are holding.  Once you get the wrapping figured out, this is really the BEST way to carry a baby :)The only down side is anyone who tends to run a little warm ( like some of us gramma LOL) this can get a little too warm.  Between the warmth of the child and the extra fabric wrapped around you, it may be a little much in the summer.I love the idea of these as a gift for a new mom :)I had the opportunity to try this at a promotional price to give my honest opinion and feedback :)  This is something I would certainly recommend!Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23ZID23ZILFY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013VAZ398#wasThisHelpful","R23ZID23ZILFY6","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My skin is not anything like the ""average"" person's skin!  It's so dry it is actually painful if I don't apply enough moisturizer :(I had been reading about Phytoceramides for a while and finally got a chance to try it. I have SUPER sensitive skin and just can't get enough moisture externally so I thought this may help.After only a  couple of weeks of taking this I can say that  it sure seems my skin is less dry. It actually feels more ""plump"" if that makes sense.I already take grape seed extract which is also good for skin but this seems to have given my skin an extra boost toward helping to retain moisture and even out the texture. I firmly believe that your skin is only as good as the fuel and nutrients your body gets so this is a great addition to what I was already doing!I like that this brand is gluten free too.The price is reasonable for the quality of the product and this is something I will be sticking with.

"So you understand the fit on these, here's my size/shape - I'm 5'2, 160lbs, size 12 in pants and usually size Large in tops as I'm larger busted.As others have mentioned, the sizing on these runs small - especially the pants BUT if you are built like me, these may be perfect!Personally, the length on the pants is perfect for wearing with clogs or tennis shoes but may be too short for someone with long legs.  I'm smaller on the bottom and legs so having the pants fit about a size smaller than average worked fine but if you have a booty, larger thighs and stomach, these may be too small.The top fits more like a standard size but still on the small size for an XL but, again, this worked great for my shape.The fabric is a bit on the stiff, scratchy side but softened up after washingThe workmanship is ""ok"" and I noticed the seams and stitching are a little wonky in some placesPersonally, these worked great for the purpose I need them for which is midwife duties in the barn when my goats are having their babies!  They have several pockets in both the pants and top for items I need to have handy, the fabric is durable and the design and fit work well for bending, kneeling and sometimes crawling around on the ground helping the goats :)I actually found this brand through a special promotion when I was able to buy these at a discount price to try out and give my honest opinion and feedback so for my needs, this was a win win :)The bottom line with these is this:If you can get the sizing issue figured out, they work. Keep in mind the price point!  These are very reasonable and would be good for maybe someone who needs an economical set of scrubs for occasional use or a temporary work situation or and doesn't want to spend a ton of $.

"I have EXTREMELY dry and VERY sensitive skin - like, off the charts sensitive - so I have to be really careful what I use as my skin is easily irritated.  For the past couple of years I've used an eyecream I really like but the price is three times what this product costs so I have been looking for a more cost effective replacement that will actually work.I've been testing out this eye cream for a couple of weeks now with daily use.  What I've found is it take just a small amount but, because of my excessively dry skin, I have to apply more than one coat in order to get the amount of moisture my skin needs.  Probably not the case for most people but I just have unusual skin :(The great thing is it does not burn my skin or make it red!  That's pretty huge for me!The other thing I like about this product is that it doesn't clog my pores like some eye creams I've used nor does it leave a white residue on my skin which is another plus.As far as dealing withe dark circles, bags and puffiness, I have not seen any dramatic results yet but that may change with continued use and I will update this review as more time passes.So the verdict for me so far is I like it!  Do I look 25 again?  Nope.  Does it provide enough hydration?  Yes, with 2 applications but, again, that may just be my skin.I feel like the price is reasonable for the quality of the product so no complaints there :)Radha was kind enough to let me try this for free to test it out and give my honest opinion and feedback - Thanks for that :)Overall, I would recommend this as a good quality alternative to overpriced eye creams that works well - especially for those with sensitive skin :)Hope this was helpful info!Enjoy","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16CAIKID6YT5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GP44O2#wasThisHelpful","R16CAIKID6YT5L","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two reasons I wanted to try this product:1.  I'm trying to stop using the OTC sleep aids I've used for years and HATE the smell and taste of Valerian Root!2.  My husband really hates taking pills because they make him gag. He needs help sleeping once in a while.I've taken Melatonin before in pill form and didn't have much luck with it helping me get to sleep.  In fairness, it could have been due my extended use of OTC sleep aids.I really love the idea of chewable suppliments for adults and wonder why it took so long for companies to produce ""grown up"" chewables!These actually taste really good!  Some of the gummies leave a weird taste in your mouth but, thankfully, these don't!I started taking these a couple of weeks ago every night in place of the OTC sleep aid I had been using.  The first couple of nights, I had trouble falling asleep but I think it had to do with my body adjusting to the lack of chemicals!After continued use for almost 2 weeks I'm happy to report that chewing up 2 of these about an hour before bed REALLY helps me fall asleep and STAY asleep AND I don't have that annoying brain fog in the morning like I get with what I used to take - BIG bonus!The price for these is very reasonable when compared to the chemical sleep aid alternative so this is something I will continue to take as a more natural solution to night time sleeplessness.  I'm really happy I got these and highly recommend this!!!I was able to purchase these at a discounted price to try out and give my honest opinion and feedback :)  I will be a repeat customer of this product!Hope this was helpful!Enjoy your ZZZZ's :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OC3B1JZ58YF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3D0BPK#wasThisHelpful","R2OC3B1JZ58YF8","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 81 year old mom has dexterity issues with her hands and finds the pump type hand soap dispensers a little painful to use.  After searching for a solution for her, I came across this sensor activated model.  These can be pretty expensive so I was attracted by the price.  We were given an opportunity to try this out through a promotion at a discount to test and give an honest opinion and feedback :)After looking it over carefully, it appears to be pretty well built though not as heavy duty as some of the higher prices models.  After putting in the batteries, loading it with hand soap and test driving it, here's what I found...While it's not stainless steel, it is a fairly well made plastic with a metal looking appearance.  Finger prints do show but it's easy to clean.The opening where you load the soap is bigger than other models that I've looked as which makes it easier to fill.I like that it can be mounted on the wall or used on the counter top because you have the option of freeing up space.The amount of soap dispensed with each use can be adjusted with a button on topWhile not silent when in use, it's pretty quiet and not annoyingThe operation is pretty straight forward...just wave your hand in front of the sensor and the soap comes out, however, I think the reflection off the shiny surface can cause the sensor to trigger on it's own so I advise using the base to keep the reflection down!  You will have soap coming out on it's own otherwise.I did notice a few times that the sensor doesn't trigger on the first pass of movement and had to try to trigger it a few times so there's that..So after I tested it and determined that it does indeed work and that it's something an elder person and easily operate I gave it to my mother and she is thrilled with it!  She actually asked for another for Christmas to put in her bathroom :)Overall, I think for the price it's a good product that serves a good purpose - especially for those who like or need hands free operation.Hope this was helpful info :)Enjoy","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PZY01WRN3M1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011S5D1II#wasThisHelpful","R3PZY01WRN3M1H","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You dudes with short hair just don't know how easy you have it sometimes!  Having to work around a pony tail when it comes to finding outdoor gear can be a bit of a challenge!I've been searching for a balaclava that would be both effective at keeping out the cold and comfortable.  I've tried a couple in the past but, with long hair, you end up either stuffing all your loose hair down the back which feels annoying after a while, or putting your hair in a ponytail and then having to deal with the bulk!  UGH!I was really excited to try this balaclava when I saw it offered through a promotion and got a chance to test it out and give my honest opinion and feedback!Just the fact that it is MADE for us pony tail clad users was nice and if it actually keeps you warm would be a huge plus!Well, I can fully attest to the fact that it is both functional AND comfortable!!!  Yessssssss!I love the lightweight but warm fabric.  It's a perfect combination of warmth without the bulk.  Having tried a fleece type before, I found the fleece to be too bulky and not practical as it would block side vision.What I also like about this one - apart from the obvious wonderfulness of having an opening for your pony tail - is that the way it's cut at the opening around your face makes it WAY more comfortable.  Sometimes the face opening is too small and you are constantly pulling the material away from your eyes.This one has plenty of room around the forehead and eyes while still providing excellent protection from the cold AND you can wear glasses.I always wear a baseball hat anyway and this one not only allows me to pull my ponytail through the opening in the balaclava but also my hat so my hat stays put even in windy situations.Though the fabric is light weight, it holds in the body heat just fine and it's soft against your skin.  The length of the fabric going down the neck area is plenty long enough for complete coverage on your neck and can tuck inside the shirt .For such a simple item, this one is done the right way and is a VERY valuable piece of gear!!!LOVE this and would not hesitate to recommend it :)Hope this was helpful info :)Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCSB3BB4110PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0150KOR6W#wasThisHelpful","RCSB3BB4110PC","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was SO hoping this would work!  Since it's advertised to work with the iPhone 6 plus, I was anxious to try it - hoping to ditch the cable set up we currently have.Sadly, after getting it set up and trying it, it just didn't work!  It would start to charge for a few seconds then stop.  After unplugging it and plugging it back in several times and getting the same result I just gave up, boxed it back up, and opted to return it for a refund :(Because the iphone doesn't have the build in technology for wireless charging, it's necessary to plug in the ""transmitter"" to your phone, keep it in the case, and set it on the charging disc - a process I didn't really find I liked anyway.  Even tho the transmitter part is thin, it still caused my case to not fit properly and I'm not about to have to take the case off each time I want to charge the phone.It was an interesting concept but poorly executed with this product which it too bad :(I noticed after I purchased this that others have had the same issues.

"First, let me say I'm sort of...well, ok..I'm a hard core PILLOW COLLECTOR!  Because of issues with my neck and back, I've been on the hunt for ""THE"" pillow that will work for me for years.  So, I have amassed a collection of 11 pillows - everything from the buckwheat, memory foam with gel, down and even the newest My Pillow.  Nothing has really worked well and I end up switching out pillows several times a night trying to get comfortable.What I've been searching for is a pillow that isn't bulky, low profile and that can be ""formed"" around my shoulder as I'm a side sleeper. So many of the pillows I've tried while thin enough, simply don't hold their shape and end up going flat after an hour or so.  The thicker, fluffier pillows end up being too bulky which holds my head too far up off the pillow causing neck pain....UGH!If you are one of those people who can sleep on any pillow, God bless you!  You have no idea how fortunate you are!I was offered an opportunity to try this pillow through a promotional offer to test out and give my honest opinion and feedback and, after reading about it, was excited to give it a try.  What was one more pillow?!  I'm more than willing to be a guinea pig, especially when it comes to a product I'm on the hunt for anyway.When this arrived, it was packaged in a clear, plastic carrying case with a handle which I thought was odd since I don't think it would really ever be used again.  The pillow was compressed completely flat and stuffed very tightly into this bag so getting it out of the carrying case was tough!When I tried to get the pillow out, the case totally ripped apart which was fine because I wasn't planning on ever using it again but thought a different packaging method would be far better!Once I got the pillow unwrapped, I watched it decompress into a normal looking, king sized pillow but that's where the ""normal"" part ended and wonderfulness began!!!I wish I could properly describe how amazingly soft this pillow is!  The cover of the pillow alone is worth the price of admission!  There is a very different feel to this fabric that, until you touch it, just looks like normal cotton but feels incredible!  It's the first pillow I've ever had that I DIDN'T want to put a pillowcase on!!  The great thing is that the cover can be removed and washed so I elected to use it without a pillowcase just because it feels SO amazing.Since it was mid day when this arrived and I had not slept well the night before, I decided it was a perfect opportunity to test drive it by taking a  quick nap :)Though this is not a thick pillow, I noticed that there is plenty of support without being too bulky.  There is just enough ""give"" to the filling to be able to sort of mold it around the shoulder and neck area and it holds it shape!I really only intended to take a quick 20 minute nap, but ended up falling SOUND asleep and didn't budge from my original position for 2 1/2 hours!!!This may not sound exciting to you, but for someone who wakes frequently with neck pain, it was right up there with a miracle!!!Upon close inspection of this pillow, the quality of construction is pretty amazing - not always the case with pillows even the very expensive ones.Since I thought may it was just a fluke that I slept a solid 2 1/2 hours without waking to make pillow adjustments, I tried it again that night and had the best night's sleep I've had in literally years.So, in conclusion, I can say without bias that this truly is the BEST pillow I've EVER used and will be buying a couple more!!!  The crazy thing is, this is not an expensive pillow to start with - $40 for a good quality, king sized pillow is VERY reasonable when you compare it to many out there on the market that make the claim that they are the worlds softest, most comfortable, etc....All I can say is TRY IT!  You have nothing to lose since it has a money back guarantee.If you have ANY trouble with sleeping because of pillow issues you will not be disappointed with this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12K1S1TBKBKSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DCEQZY#wasThisHelpful","R12K1S1TBKBKSV","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I'm sure this works great for gardening, I didn't buy it for that purpose.  I raise goats and twice a year, I have midwife duties to attend to out in the barn :)  This means I have quite a few supplies I'm toting back and forth and, in the past, I've used a 5 gal bucket plus a few bags to hold everything.  It's awkward and not the most efficient system!After searching for a cost effective solution, I found this awesome bucket apron that has ended up being the perfect thing!I put the puppy pads, blankets and towels inside the bucket inside a garbage bag to keep them clean.  The birthing supplies got into all the many pockets on the sides where I can easily reach what I need.The pockets are just the right depth and width to where I can get to the smaller items I need to grab quickly without the goats being able to pull them out!The canvas is sturdy and straps and attachments are  well constructed for a pretty inexpensive item.  The split side goes over the handle then the strap secures it around the bucket.  My only issue, which is a small one, is I'd like to see them make the canvas a darker color so the dirt doesn't show quite so easily.  I suppose you can wash it by hand.  I haven't tried that yet but will need to one of these days after the next kidding season :)Overall, this is a very helpful item for what I needed it for but could also be used for horse folks, crafters, painters, etc...anywhere that you have several mid sized items you need to keep within reach AND a bucket :)I was able to purchase this at a promotional price to test and give my honest opinion and feedback.I can happily say I would recommend it and have found it to be just what I needed for the task at hand :)Hope this was helpful info!Enjoy","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RM97JU9HYNY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9L7T2E#wasThisHelpful","R2RM97JU9HYNY9","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:09 Mins This is a pretty handy, functional light and much bigger than it appears in the photo (See video for a demo)  Thankfully, it's pretty simple to use because there were no instructions included as to how and where to insert batteries and the general operation!  It came from China so it took weeks to get here.It's a simple operation - just pull the handles up and the lamp comes on.  Push it back down to collapse and the light goes out.The lights are actually pretty bright for a small lamp and the handle on top is great for hanging inside a tent or on a tree for camping.  This produces enough light to play cards or eat at a picnic table while camping and also makes a good emergency light for the house if the power goes out.One thing to note on this lamp is the weight.  If you are a backpacker who is concerned about gear weight, this is probably not the lamp to take as it is rather heavy compared to other lamps available with the same brightness.Overall, this is a good little lamp!I was able to purchase this at a promo price to test it out and give an honest opinion and feedback.Hope this was helpful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WL8IK71IN7BB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NS4TXM#wasThisHelpful","R2WL8IK71IN7BB","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:20 Mins We are avid campers, backpackers and kayakers so we've collected our share of gear over the years!  We have a set of items we use for backpacking which are ultra-light titanium, small and packable. The regular camping/kayak gear does not have to be quite so small and light as we have more space to work with when packing so we got this cook set for that purpose.I mentioned that because this set would not be what you hardcore ultralight folks call ...well..ultralight BUT, if you were only taking ONE set of cookware for two people, this set would totally work!The pictures just don't do this set justice which is why I did a video so you can see what this whole thing looks like ""in person!""We were totally surprised by the quality of this set because of the low price.  It's a well constructed, coated aluminum with protected, fold away handles.  These sizes are perfect for frying up eggs, potatoes, a small fish with the larger one with the lid works great for soups, stew or dehydrated meals.You get a ladle, small wooded spoon, 2 cups and a pan cleaner that all nest inside. The net carrying bag is nice for keeping everything together and organized.We sort of stumbled upon this set through a special promotional offer with a discount for testing this out and giving our honest opinion and feedback!  Shopping for outdoor camping cookware can get confusing with so many choices and price points to consider.This set is proof you don't have to spend twice as much to get a good quality cookware set.  We are VERY pleased with this set and highly recommend it!! :)Hope this was helpful info :)Enjoy :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7VZVFAT8O1J8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151DBC5C#wasThisHelpful","R7VZVFAT8O1J8","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a hairstylist, I pay careful attention to hair care products - how they perform on a variety of hair types - so I'm able to recommend the proper products when asked.The idea of bar shampoo was interesting to me but honestly I really didn't have high expectations and assumed this would be rather harsh to use on fragile, color treated or damaged hair.  The reason I bought this is because I was looking for the most efficient product for the purpose of packing into a backpack or gear bag.I actually cut this bar up into 5 pieces (its a good sized bar) and wrapped the pieces in cling wrap.  There is one bar in each of our backpacks and one in both of our grab and go bags!  The fifth piece I used to test the product.What I found was it has a very nice, mild fragrance, it lathers well for not having all of the harsh ingredients. does a nice job of cleansing the hair and rinses well.The only issue, at least with my hair, is that if you have fine and/or color treated hair, you will want to use a conditioner after shampooing.  My husband, however, loved this bar!  Since his hair is rather short, he doesn't have to worry about tangles so he was quite happy with how the shampoo left his hair.I let our daughter use it and she has long, fine hair without color or highlights and her hair tends to get oily.  She liked how her hair felt and said her scalp was not as oily by the end of the day as is usually the case for her.I decided I liked this enough to have it be ""the"" shampoo for our gear bags and I'm solving the tangle issue by packing a small spray bottle of leave in treatment.After a couple of days of washing my hair with this I found I needed to use a conditioning mask since I have fine, highlighted hair and it was starting to feel flyaway.I think this product would actually be very good for use on children's hair since it is mild and easy to use :)Overall, I really like this and feel it would work well for many different hair types and really appreciate the minimal ingredients :)Through a promotional offer, I was able to purchase this at a discount to test and give my honest opinion and feedback.So, yes i recommend this and feel its a good quality product at a fair price.  Just be aware it may not work on all hair types :)Hope this was helpful info for you shampoo shoppers!Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K0A0T36XKHBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTC4O22#wasThisHelpful","R1K0A0T36XKHBK","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:24 MinsPlease see the video review for a detailed look at this set of pans with additional info :)We do a lot of camping and kayaking and are always on the lookout for good quality, well made gear that is compact and not too heavy.  The problem is, it can get very expensive!We had the opportunity to try out this set at a promotional price to give our honest opinion and feedback so we jumped on it!Believe me, the product description and pics don't do this set justice!What a great surprise to open this up and find that, for less than $25, this set more than met our needs and expectations!You get 4 graduated sized pans which all nest inside each other - ranging from a coffee cup sized small pot to a large pot that is more than large enough to cook a large sized, dehydrated meal for 2!I think one of the  best parts about this set is that your gas stove fits right inside perfectly for storage which is crucial for saving precious space in your gear bag or backpack.The wrap around handles of each pot are coated with a type of plastic which helps protect your hands from heat BUT you need to know that these pots are really designed to be used with a camp stove rather than on an open campfire!  The plastic WILL melt off if you set these pots in the fire!!For you ultralight backpackers - while this is a sturdy, well constructed and well designed set, it is not ultralight like titanium.  Which, of course, is the trade off for the reasonable price.However, for the average camper, kayaker and backpacker, this is a GREAT set if you are not counting ounces with your gear.  Don't get me wrong, its not heavy by any means, its just not what can be classified as ultralight!BTW, I'm married to a hardcore, ultralight guy who cuts the end off his toothbrush and weighs EVERYTHING that goes in his pack to cut as much weight out of his gear as possible!  Seriously, he can survive in the wilderness for 2 weeks carrying a NINE POUND PACK which includes his food!!!So take a look at the video to actually see this stove set ""in person"" so you can get a good idea of the function and quality :)We have already used this for 2 weekend adventures and really love it and for sure can recommend this set!Hope this was helpful info :)Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9DRQV3BEHNLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMLPU7C#wasThisHelpful","R9DRQV3BEHNLD","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The shape is PERFECT to fit the knee and the strap holds the pack in place quite well.

"We have a barn for our goats that has no electricity in it so I came across these lights to try as a source of light inside the barn!  Unlike solar, they can be used inside though they do require batteries.The nice thing about these is that they are motion activated so they will only come on when I walk into the barn which saves battery life.  They are very bright which surprised me!  I was able to use only one instead of both in one end of the barn and one at the other end which gives me plenty of light to see by.They seem to be pretty well made though there are other options of different brands for quite a bit more than these but they are heavier construction.  These were easy to mount using the provided hardware and the light comes off the mount when you need to change batteries which is nice.So far, they are working great!  Time will tell if they last but I will update if there is a problem.I've tipped these up enough to where the goats don't set them off all night and so they come on only when I'm out there.I'm actually going to order another set for inside our garage and shed!For the price, this is a good option if you need to light up an area and can't use solar lights :)We even were able to get a promo price on these to try them out and give our honest opinion and feedback but I would have paid full price for them as I think they are fairly priced for what you get :)Hope this was helpful info :)Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QV8I1F5CB3CG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015C1A6SM#wasThisHelpful","R2QV8I1F5CB3CG","A1IDB6LF2RQSF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDB6LF2RQSF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm not sure how they make this, but it is BY FAR superior to the basic HA serum that's available out there.It takes just a small amount to do the job and you can immediately feel the moisture being drawn into your skin.

"Five stars for its genre.The ensemble cast gets better with every episode.Police work, by itself, can get pretty formulaic. What distinguishes this from shows like CSI, is the attention to character development and the myriad ways the cast members interact.No matter how compelling a story line, if I don't care about the people it ends up falling flat.

"It's always a joy when something fairly straight forward like a slider top bag works. Because it's such a common product it's easy to take the design for granted. I used to think there was no difference in zip lock or slider lock bags like this, but there is. Slider top bags seem to work more reliably than zip lock bags. These are made of heavier plastic and will open and close perfectly time after time. If you use them for traveling, especially with a wet item like a swimsuit, this is no small feat.

"This was quite quick and easy to assemble. In addition, it is fairly simple to change from the motorized brush head to the one for floors. That said, I am a bit lazy when it comes to doing things like that on a regular basis, so I would leave it in the mode I use most. You can also quickly separate the hand vac. All a big bother, as far as I can tell. However, if you live in an apartment and want the benefits of all three in one handy vacuum, this was designed for you.The bare floor attachment worked brilliantly, and this is what I was most interested in. It neatly dispatched any dirt from the tightest corners, far better than any other vacuum or soft mop I have ever used.As much as I love that feature, the vacuum is not light, so carrying it while you vacuum gives you an extra work-out. Fine for small jobs, but a bit cumbersome if you are doing a larger area.One minor design flaw is that the end of the plug does not fit the wrapped up cord, so when you are ready to store it the cord dangles.

"I have been using a Bose Wave Radio for many years and it has always provided me with great, reliable sound whether with a CD, radio, or through my ipod.This newest model is a bit more streamlined, takes up the same amount of space, and has no visible buttons. The remote is intuitive and easy to set up and navigate.I hooked up my ipod with a 3.5 male to male cable and it worked beautifully.The sound quality, whether listening to Janos Starker on cello, Mozart, Kirtan (yoga chants), Enya, harpsichord, synthesizer, or spoken word, was rich, full-bodied, layered, and balanced. Regardless of whether the decibel level was low or high, though the high range was fantastic.As they instructed, I placed the system a couple of feet from the wall, not in a corner. It filled the room evenly and fully.You might think this is a lot of money for ""a radio,"" but it is far more than a radio, and may outlast you. Once you get used to the great sound other less expensive offerings sound thin, tinny, and electronic.If you are looking for something that will sound just as good 15 years after you bought it, I would recommend a Bose radio. I thought my first one was a fortune, but if I reflect on how many thousands of times I have enjoyed listening to it, and the pennies it cost me a day, it has been fully amortized.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3106HHRVCHC8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6MBO#wasThisHelpful","R3106HHRVCHC8Z","A7EK88GF8N40F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EK88GF8N40F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bose SoundTouch 10 is an excellent system that enables you to have music, podcasts, and audiobooks available at the press of a button in any room with wifi.The sleek black design is compatible with almost all decors, and is small enough to hide in a corner.You can access your content via preset buttons on the top of the device or by using the remote.Set up was easy at first and then got complicated because my PC was connected to the internet both through wifi and cable. Clearly, the cable was unnecessary, but I didn't know that. You only need one connection. I initially set up the system through my ipad air which was intuitive and only took about 10-15 minutes. The reason I had to contact customer support was I wanted to sync my iTunes library to the Bose SoundTouch. The person I spoke with was patient, knowledgeable, and solved the problem. (And, waiting for tech support only took about a minute.)I tried the sound qulaity with both classical music and PBS news. The music sounded resonant and rich and had plenty of volume. The speech was clear and easy to understand.NOTE: Day two. Apparently, my iTunes library is so vast (17,000 items) that it was hard to keep it synched with the Bose system. I could have synched it through Bluetooth, but that meant having to remember to Bluetooth on and off via my desktop, and I use the sound on that all the time; so, it wasn't a viable option. Another idea would be to spend $80 for a NAS drive but that didn't appeal to me, either. I will buy the 3.5mm male to male cable so I can attach my ipod directly to the speaker. It will do the trick, but is not the seamless experience I was hoping for.I can still listen to radio stations from around the world, i Heart Radio, Pandora, and anything that's downloaded through iTunes on my ipad.This is a great product if you use it with Bluetooth, or don't have an extensive iTunes library to sync.I hope to have it as long as I have had my Bose radio, which is more years than I can remember.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TNUPKV6M23HJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH685E#wasThisHelpful","R2TNUPKV6M23HJ","A7EK88GF8N40F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EK88GF8N40F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Still, if we want to understand how our deeper connection to each other transcends money and privilege, this book can help.The writing is good, and just because she knows where her next meal is coming from doesn't make her story less human or touching.The only really annoying thing to me was the ridiculously unhealthy diet her doctor prescribed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EKQSYFX6JALD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0452297508#wasThisHelpful","R3EKQSYFX6JALD","A7EK88GF8N40F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EK88GF8N40F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the scent, my clothes seem very clean, and it's certainly easy to just throw one of these pods into your wash before you put in the laundry. That said, they are not cheap. I can buy the liquid detergent on sale at my local drugstore for under two dollars for 32 washes. Are they comparable? I am not sure. My clothes don't get especially dirty.

"Some reviewers have noted this size bottle does not have a scent. The one I just received, 8-18-2015, is definitely scented. It rates on my scale as a very light slightly flowery aroma, and it didn't linger after my shower.I used it as directed, but did not wait to air dry. My skin feels soft. Comparable to a very good moisturizing lotion.It is a different routine from what I am used to, but I think it's actually faster than putting lotion on.Aside from the speed factor, it seems to be made with mostly natural ingredients; so, if that appeals to you it would be a good choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFXD73L444WCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZWTMLW#wasThisHelpful","RFXD73L444WCS","A7EK88GF8N40F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EK88GF8N40F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"German Box put out in 1980 containing all the Stones Decca era LP's and some German Lp's like 'Around And Around' which was a German compilation of their first singles and ep's.

"This is from a BBC produced 3 hour radio show, one of the first times rare BBC Beatles songs were ever played.As a 'radio show' it works very well, with interviews and a cohesiveness that's sorely missing in Apple's BBC issues. It alsoincludes some songs that weren't on the Official Apple BBC sets, like from their very first Radio show, Roy Orbison's 'Dream Baby'.Quality is very rough on that one, but it's nice they included it into this Radio show and it's very listenable. The majority of the rest ofthe songs are in Fantastic Sound Quality. And this was way before Digital mastering came really into play, so this is an All Analogue MasteredLp Set/Box. All in all, a great Sunday Morning listen. Well done to the BBC.This should have been released to the general public instead of the Apple issues, but at least a few of the Radio LP's still exist.Gerard Masters","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15D27L2DYM5NH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHX80TG#wasThisHelpful","R15D27L2DYM5NH","ASFXD8YLO67KW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFXD8YLO67KW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just put this turntable into service today. First album played: Miles 'Kind Of Blue'. I upgraded the stock cartridge to an Audio Technica AT100E. Excellent Sound! Not going to win any 'High End' turntable awards but for what it is it is well made, at least the one I got. I'm reading a few reviews from people who got a bad unit-motor/speed problems is the common culprit. Denon NEEDS to step up on this and not give people the run around.  My advice is this: when you get the turntable, play the heck out of it. The best way would be to lift the cueing lever up but without moving the tonearm over the middle of the platter, just move it enough to start the platter turning, and then leave it run for 3 days non stop-if the motor or belt is flaking out this should force it to do it within the return period. Again, do not hesitate to send it back to Amazon if it flakes out on you, that is why Amazon continues to be my favorite retailer.The Aluminum Platter is flat and machined perfectly-no wobble at all. This was not the case on the AT120 I bought 5 years ago where the platter actually wobbles back and forth while spinning. The Heavy Rubber Mat gives it some heft. Stock belt is serviceable but lightweight, installed an upgraded belt from LP Gear for $18 and the Platter spins with no audible flutter or noise. The  Auto function is incredibly smooth, much more than I would have expected from this price range. Very impressive. Also the torque of the motor is impressive, when I put the Discwasher on the record I did not detect much slow down from the motor! Almost felt like a direct drive. And the tonearm is very expensive looking, although, the 'finger' arch could be longer. Counterweight is impressive looking with gold type color. But the sound right out of the box is in line with my classic Pioneer PL 518, a nice feat! So for anybody looking to jump in, this is the sonic equivalent to the mid Music Hall decks like the 5.1 I had. And that thing costs me $875. But of course it's build quality was more substantial than the Denon. But all in all, a nice Budget deck, update the cart and your good to go.Oh, and I also put a drop of High Quality oil on the motor's top bearing and on the bottom of the platter spindle.Enjoy!gerard mastersJune 2015 update:Tonight I pulled the Denon out of the rack and put it on my test bench. I wanted to see what's inside. After opening the bottom plate I found a very well manufactured piece of gear here. The layout of the inside part of the turntable, which you don't see unless your a technician, is on par with the Japanese manufacturing practices of the 1980's and 1990's. In fact, comparing the Quality of this Denon TT against the $700 Pioneer PLX1000, well, this just blows that deck away. Here we have a professionally looking turntable, with parts nicely soldered, wires nicely 'dressed' and all the moving parts lubed and locked with locking glue (blue that is). I'll say it again, the construction quality of this $349 turntable BLOWS AWAY THE CONSTRUCTION QUALITY OF THE PIONEER PLX1000.With that said, I will stand by my original review. If you do as I say and run the unit for three or more days, the motor, if it is defective should give out, in which case you pack it up and send it back to Amazon as defective. BUT......I have to tell you that I got a good unit and it is in every way a high quality turntable. In fact, looking closely at the tone arm, both on top and underneath with the bottom plate removed, I would have to say that in order to get a higher quality tonearm you would have to spend over $1000.00 on a Pro-Ject or Rega TT. Denon, although budget, really did a great job on this turntable. But......if you REALLY want to go nuts, then buy the Audio Technica AT100E and replace the stock cartridge, even though it's very good, the 100E will bring you very close to 'AUDIOPHILE HEAVEN' on vinyl........now, back to our regularly scheduled programming.gerard masters","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39OCCYZAUIU0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FMNBXG#wasThisHelpful","R39OCCYZAUIU0X","ASFXD8YLO67KW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFXD8YLO67KW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Febuary 2015 and These SHM-CD'S of the Entire Beatles Stereo Catalog have sold out in Japan and there is no talk of a second pressing. Comments on the internet Beatles Forums Have it split: Some people claim to hear a real/Better fidelity difference compared to the 2009 cd's, and others say they sound the same. Packaging is what the 2009's should have been. They are beautiful and to these ears Do sound more cohesive/clearer soundstage than the Domestic Ones. But YMMV.

"Well I got this Yammy yesterday and popped it into my system to check it out and see what it does.I like another reviewer bought this mainly as an Universal 'Audio' player for SACD's.One surprise is that, although there is only ONE reference to it in the manual, It plays AND decodes HDCD's!Yes that's right, HDCD's. I don't know why Yamaha downplays this but it's a HUGE plus to us who have and really like the sound of HDCD'S.It loads discs quickly, very quickly in fact and that includes BluRay discs.It's not going to win any construction awards-it's light but solid-typical mass market china manufactured product, but I didn't expect anything more to tell you the truth, not for $219, which is how much I paid for a 'refurbished' one from A4Less.Like every thing I get electronic from china I popped the cover to see if all the screws inside were torqued properly, they were, which is unusual but nice to see. The circuit board construction is top notch, the disc transport on the other hand is definitely low budget, but in operation it does it's job silently and smoothly, again, even the budget stuff nowadays seems to operate like the premium gear from years past. How long will it last?? who knows, but for what it is and what it does, for a little over $200 it is good value and it sounds really really incredible.The remote is laid out well but really feels cheap, which again, it is. You do have to push the buttons firmly or it doesn't respond to commands.It does have a Texas Instruments 32 bit DAC, Be AWARE though that there is an older model WITH THE SAME MODEL NUMBER that used a 24 bit DAC. Yamaha's site doesn't help matters because if you do a google search for 'yamaha BD-S667BL the yamaha site it goes to is the older model, and on that site it say's that it's a 'Discontinued' model. How stupid Yamaha, really? This unit I got was manufactured in 2014-it tells you on the back panel-so I'm sure this is the 'newer' model.Now if you go to the yamaha.usa site and from their home page go to the blu ray players it's there that this newer 32 Bit model shows up.Laser speed is almost instant. On the Beach Boys 'Smiley Smile' cd, I went from track 1 to the last track, 28 in a fraction of a second.So a good solid unit that is not the most sturdy construction wise, but for the money it plays well with a number of different discs, plays HDCD'S and sounds excellent thanks to the Texas Instruments 32 Bit DAC. And I'm listening to Dave Brubecks 'Time Out' right now, the sound quality is stellar! One of the best sounding CD spinners I've heard, and I'm being serious when I say that.gerard masters","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REJ1S41L9WW66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I19TOGS#wasThisHelpful","REJ1S41L9WW66","ASFXD8YLO67KW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASFXD8YLO67KW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But the logical running order and fidelity of even the before booted tracks make this a grand LP to slip on yo turntable and listen to.

"Jason Bovberg, Draw Blood (Permuted Press, 2015)full disclosure: an ARC of this book was provided to me free of charge by the author. As this review is based on an ARC, minor details may be different between the copy I reviewed and the final release version.Jason Bovberg knows how to do this sequel thing. The middle book of a trilogy tends to be a quagmire for authors (just look at Tolkein, Lewis, and Hobb), but with Draw Blood, Bovberg found himself a perfect angle to play, and he played it well indeed.SPOILER ALERT: The synopsis necessarily contains spoilers for Blood Red. If you have not read that one yet and are planning to, skip the next paragraph.Draw Blood opens mere moments after Blood Red ends, which will not surprise anyone who's read Blood Red; it ends in such a way as to make that a given. But Bovberg switches points of view for the second book; we see this one through the eyes of Rachel's father, Michael, with the book starting as he wakes up from the coma he was in during the parts of Blood Red in which he appeared. This allows Bovberg to write from something of an unique* place here; he has the perfect excuse for the ‚Äúas you know, Bob‚Äù moments that are so annoying in many books. That said, he also manages to make them far more intelligent than usual. Michael is not a stupid guy. He puts things together quickly, and this does not seem out of place to us, since we already know stuff. We get to see the same characters, and a few interesting new ones, through Michael's eyes. There's also the possibility for post-apocalyptic romance; once Michael discovers the results of Rachel's first trip home, he rebounds pretty hard with (the obvious character, but I won't spoil it). I thought that would ring false. It didn't. But all of this is side material, really. The two main plot threads deal with (a) the continuing threat of the aliens and the possessed, and (b) the effects of the new information Rachel gleaned in one of Blood Red's last sequences‚Äîthat after injecting her ex-boyfriend with O-neg, he regained enough of himself to recognize Rachel and say her name. Can the possessed be saved? And even if they can, has the possession done too much damage to their bodies for them to come back without going insane immediately?It's all very good stuff, and if it's been done before in this way, I haven't seen it. There's not a great deal to say about either the technical aspects or the overarching plot that I didn't say in my Blood Red review, save that the plot unrolls at about the same pace here as it did there. The book is episodic, but I rush to add that this is not a knock against it; because of the structure and the events therein, it wouldn't really be possible to present a lot of this any other way. Interesting characters doing interesting things, with a solid hook and the continuation of a premise that combines the best things about the Autumn series, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Night of the Living Dead in one (surprisingly, given that comparison) coherent tale. If you liked Blood Red, Draw Blood will definitely not let you down. *** Ω* Yes, I know that is‚Äîsupposedly‚Äîincorrect.

"Antiviral (Brandon Cronenberg, 2012)The whole time I was watching Antiviral, the debut film from Brandon Cronenberg‚Äîif the last name sounds familiar, it's because Brandon is the son of revered Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg‚ÄîI was thoroughly enchanted with it. I kept having to remind myself that, yes, the movie does have some shortcomings, and they kept it from rating higher than it did. But the movie's immense style made me want to gloss those shortcomings over. This is definitely a case of form over function, and in that, early Brandon is on the same track as early David was‚Äîand by ‚Äúearly‚Äù with David Cronenberg I'm talking about his earliest features, 1969's Stereo and 1970's Crimes of the Future, rather than the ‚Äúearly‚Äù stuff everyone's seen (Shivers, Rabid, and The Brood, by the last of which Cronenberg had already, as far as I'm concerned, reached the heights of body-horror greatness he would plumb until 1999's eXistenZ). When it comes right down to it, you're going to want to say you knew him when.Plot: Syd March (No Country for Old Men's Caleb Landry Jones) works for a near-future company that specializes in a new form of celebrity-worship; they harvest diseases from celebrities, culture them, and infect paying clients with the same strain of the same disease their heroes have. In any case, supermodel Hannah Geist (Dracula Untold's Sarah Gadon) is rumored to have a brand new disease that no one has ever seen before, and Syd's company is desperate to get their hands on some of it. Syd is on the case‚Äînot only because he's good at his job, but because, unknown to his company, he is obsessed with Hannah.Brandon does things the same way Dad does‚Äîbuild the characters well enough so that no matter how weird the situations, things remain somewhat plausible. Where Brandon differs is that it was pretty rare to find a pre-Spider Cronenberg film that seemed in any way realistic. In the days of ubiquitous reality TV and websites devoted to celebrity gossip seeing millions of hits per day, Brandon's near-future vision seems all too realistic. While there's an obvious body-horror aspect to what goes on here, this is more a movie about atmosphere, tension, and paranoia than it is about gross-out special effects, and it benefits tremendously from this. An tiviral is a touch unformed and maybe could've used one more rewrite to tighten up the plot, but it's stylish, creepy, and excels at portions of the filmmaker's craft that many journeymen have never mastered; a very good debut from a promising filmmaker. Can't wait to see what he does next. *** ¬Ω","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZPI0T25MROBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CERJIR8#wasThisHelpful","R1ZPI0T25MROBA","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Comforting Skin (Derek Franson, 2011)The first half-hour or thereabouts of Comforting Skin is annoying in the extreme. It feels like it's going to be just another mumblecore movie (not even a mumblegore movie because, you know, no violence). You know the drill. Annoying characters you can't stand doing things they couldn't afford in the real world without anything much really going on around them. And then Koffie (Good Luck Chuck's Victoria Bidewell), our main character, gets her tattoo. And everything changes.At the beginning, Koffie, co-worker Synthia (MVP: Most Valuable Primate's Jane Sowerby), and best-friend-who-Koffie-kind-of-wants-to-date-but-not-really Nathan (Road to Nowhere's Tygh Runyan) are exactly those people you loathe in the movies. Koffie and Synthia drink at the restaurant they both hate working at (they keep working there because, presumably, they can drink free‚Äîthey certainly can't afford the amount of alcohol they consume on tips), have endless conversations about life, try to decide whether Nathan's hot or not, discuss Synthia's parade of sugar daddies, you get the idea. Those of you who give up on the movie and turn it off during this section are missing out, though. Koffie, feeling insecure, gets a tattoo because she thinks it'll make her look sexy/mysterious/more attractive. And then it starts whispering to her.NOTE: the rest of this review will reveal, and then talk about, the major spoiler for the film. While you may well have guessed it from the brief synopsis above, if you are sensitive to that sort of thing and plan on seeing the film (you should), stop reading now.The final hour and change of Comforting Skin is as perfect a depiction of Koffie's descent into delusional anxiety and depression as one could ask for. I speak from experience; I was in the exact place Koffie ends up in the climax of this film a little less than seven months ago. So when I tell you that Franson (who also wrote) knows his stuff, well, it's fresh in my mind, delusions and all. The longer that section of the movie went, the more I could identify with her. While it doesn't allow me to excuse how shallow and horrible a person Koffie is during the first half-hour of the movie, it makes it a little more understandable, and you can put the first bit down to debut-film jitters. Especially since the rest of the movie belies the first part by making it hard to believe this is a first film. Franson seems to go from not knowing where to put a camera, and certainly having no clue when to cut a scene or to stop with the repetition of a theme, to being the guy who gets pace, tension, and the small, subtle points of perfect movie characterization better than at least half the big-name filmmakers working in Hollywood today. If only any character in Interstellar had been half as complex and realistic as Koffie in the last hour of Comforting Skin, it would have been the great film it thought it was.The dark side of getting it that right is, well, you get it that right. A lot of the last hour of this movie is going to be very awkward to sit through if you're normal. (To be fair, it's just as awkward if you get it, but at least you can vouch for its veracity.) And while I understand where Franson was going in one particular scene‚Äîwithout it being a major spoiler for one character, a lot of people had the same problem with Eric England going there in Contracted, though he knew what he was doing more‚Äîhe may have been setting himself up for a lot of righteous anger from some people who will see that scene as marginalizing. Take it as you will; be warned you might be offended by it. Me, I was riveted to the screen the entire last hour of the film. Your mileage may vary. *** ¬Ω","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K8T298Q9L7GM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUQ102U#wasThisHelpful","R3K8T298Q9L7GM","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Sucky Teen Romance (Emily Hagins, 2011)Despite only giving Emily Hagins' first feature, Pathogen, three stars (but let's remember, three is still ‚Äúabove average‚Äù on a five-star scale), I unhesitatingly recommended it in my review because, well, it's a zombie movie that was made by a twelve-year-old and, aside from having basically no budget and some problems with acting ability, was a clever, fun take on the genre. Hagins returned five years later with her third feature, My Sucky Teen Romance, a teen vampire comedy whose purpose is to make fun of teen vampire comedies. And my favorite thing about it is that in every way, it's obvious Emily Hagins took Pathogen as a learning experience. My Sucky Teen Romance is a much better movie technically, with much more solid acting and a clever script (written by Hagins). In short: if you like your teen comedies with more romance than raunch, My Sucky Teen Romance is for you.Plot: Kate (the gorgeous Elaine Hurt in her screen debut) is a shy teen with a hefty crush on comic-book-store employee Paul (Belleflower's Patrick Delgado). Kate convinces her best friend, society girl Allison (The Retelling's Lauren Lee), to go to a comic convention with her and a couple of nerdy friends, intending to run into Paul. What she doesn't know is that a few days beforehand, Paul was bitten by a vampire (Supernatural Activity's Devin Bonn√©e) and is in the process of changing. She also doesn't know that he feels the same way about her, but when the two of them are about to confess their feelings for one another, they're jostled in a hallway, and Paul's new fangs get jammed into Kate's neck. Which is all well and good, except that (a) they don't want to be vampires and (b) Kate's friends are all about staking the two of them before they turn for good. The two of them frantically try to hunt down the vampire that bit Paul before the process is irreversible.I'm not going to try and convince you that there's any boundary-pushing to be done here or anything like that. This is a genre movie that revels in its genre movie-ness. This is not necessarily a bad thing; after all, a genre movie that delivers on the promises of the genre is a success on most levels you could care to mention. You could probably make the argument that I'm cutting Hagins some slack, and I wouldn't argue with you, but in all fairness, I've probably given more positive reviews to comedies in the past year than I did in the decade before that. Maybe I'm just getting softer in my old age, but I had a very good time with this one. *** ¬Ω","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EDGCOFM3UF9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008B9JUG2#wasThisHelpful","R2EDGCOFM3UF9E","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"White Dog (Samuel Fuller, 1982)There a number of directors who have become canonical over the years whose films I have simply never gotten. Woody Allen. Mario Bava. Sam Fuller. Every time I dig into a Fuller movie I try and see what it is that sets him apart, and every time I fail. My most recent attempt was with the 1982 racism melodrama White Dog, and I think that perhaps I've figured out what the canon sees in him. I still didn't get to the ‚Äúall that and a bag of racists‚Äù point with this one, but it's starting to make sense. The thing about Sam Fuller's strain of melodrama, if I'm right in my hypothesizing, is that in movies like Shock Corridor and Pickup on South Street, both of which left me kind of cold, Fuller was doing that gig first; Douglas Sirk and Grace Metalious and Russ Meyer and all that lot would come after and hone the genre, so that when Fuller returned to the fold in the eighties, he not only had his own base to work from, he had everyone else's, too. And I think that, more than anything, may be what impressed me about White Dog: Fuller wasn't afraid to build on the work of others, rather than focusing obsessively upon his own corpus.Plot: Julie Sawyer (Little Darlings' Kristy McNichol) finds what she believes to be a stray dog. Very attractive beast, if a little scraggly, so she takes him home, shows him a little TLC, and everything seems great‚Äîuntil all the sudden he attacks someone out of nowhere while she's walking him. Eventually, a pattern of behavior is established, and she comes to realize that he's not called a ‚Äúwhite dog‚Äù because of the color of his coat‚Äîthis is a dog who has been trained to attack black people. Believing that this behavior can be unlearned, she enlists the help of Hollywood animal trainer Keys (Terminator's late, great Paul Winfield) in retraining him. Keys, upon finding out (firsthand) the dog's conditioning, is reluctant to accept the job, but eventually becomes as obsessed as Julie with the idea that racism can be cured.These days, in hindsight, when we think of Kristy McNichol, we think about her memoir and the horrible things that happened to her and, tangentially at best, Empty Nest. She didn't make a huge number of features over the course of her career, and Two Moon Junction was a horrible choice for everyone involved, but if you go back farther than that, McNichol was very good at what she did. Pair her with a guy like Winfield, who could take a dead guy on a table and give a compelling performance, and you've got some bones to hang a movie on. A maudlin movie to be sure, nakedly manipulative and full of the kinds of characters who have all the depth of a Phoenix snowstorm, but every once in a while there are good guys, there are bad guys, and we're not supposed to disagree. Fuller's got himself a ready-made villain‚ÄîI mean, who trains a dog to attack black people?‚Äîand from there, your hero being a black dog trainer is obvious. That their characters have all the shade of a Joshua tree is kind of irrelevant.Not a bad little movie at all; my favorite of the Fullers I've seen by a pretty wide margin. Expect something closer to a disease-of-the-week TV movie than Kurosawa and you'll have a grand time with it. *** ¬Ω","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38XD1G4O13UT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GCATWA#wasThisHelpful","R38XD1G4O13UT6","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Evictors (Charles B. Pierce, 1979)There are a whole lot of directors at work in America today who should be sat down‚Äîwith as much force as necessary‚Äîand made to watch The Evictors, which is an excellent example of how to make a stylish, effective thriller on a basement budget. But since that's not going to happen, I can distill what they need to learn from this movie into a single sentence: look backward, not forward. Look, if you dare, at the plague of Asylum pictures and Syfy Original Movies and all that sort of dreck, and one thing you will likely notice is that everyone's waving around CGI like it's a brand-new toy they can't get enough of. It's a very loud, flashy toy, and it annoys the hell out of mom and dad five minutes after the box is opened. Now watch the opening sequence of The Evictors, which is filmed in sepia-tone; the sequence takes place in the thirties, and Pierce was going for that kind of look. It's very well-shot, it's obviously out of place, and it does what it sets out to do. If this movie was made in 2013, that sequence would probably be CGIed to death, and the movie would be the worse for it. This is not to say that The Evictors is a perfect film, not by any stretch of the imagination, but for what it is, it is a very good one.Ben and Ruth Watkins (Kill Bill's Michael Parks and Suspiria's Jessica Harper) are a newly-married couple who get transferred to a little town in the sticks for Ben's job. They're still not rolling in cash, so the local realtor, Jake Rudd (The Bad News Bears' Vic Morrow), shows them a cheap house not far outside of town. You've seen this movie before. As soon as they move in, the townsfolk start treating them oddly, and soon they begin hearing rumors that awful things have happened in that house. With most of the town unwilling to help them, can they figure out what's going on with their erstwhile dream home before they end up being another story the locals tell their kids to keep them from going out at night?A number of reviews I've read of the movie have as their main criticism that it isn't actually a horror movie. Compared to most of today's horror films, especially in America, it's easy to understand why people might raise this as an issue. Even something like the first half of The Descent, which has as its main fear-inducer simple claustrophobia, has a grittier, scarier feel to it than The Evictors. This is much more an exercise in atmosphere, tension, and suspense than it is horror. I do not in any way consider that a bad thing; quite the opposite. This is a horror film for people who appreciate B√®la Tarr and Krzyzstof Kieslowski movies. Better, then, to bring up some wooden acting‚Äîthe more I see of Jessica Harper, the more I wonder why she continued getting roles in movies‚Äîand some set decoration that was kind of silly even for a zero-budget movie. (Just wait till you get a load of the neighbor's sitting room.) Still, despite problems, there is a great deal about The Evictors to like. ***","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUWJEMY8T892K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001E7TL8#wasThisHelpful","RUWJEMY8T892K","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Warren L. G. DeMills, Affections (No press listed, 2012)Had I been planning on giving this any stars, it would have lost them for incomplete information.Vanity-, POD-, and Self-published poetry comes in two flavors, with no middle ground: it's either really, really good or really, really bad. If you are familiar with vanity-published work at all, you are probably not surprised by the idea that 90% of the vanity-published books you will pick up are of the latter flavor. When it comes to poetry‚Äîand I will admit right up from that my criteria for what makes a great poem is far, far stricter than it is for prose‚Äîthat number tends to be closer to 99%. Now, why am I telling you all this? Well, there's the kicker. As I write these words at the end of September 2014, Affections has eight reviews at Amazon. One of them is a three-star review (which to me means ‚Äúlightly recommended‚Äù, since 2.5 is the average). All the rest are either four or five stars. So this has got to be one of the one percent, right?Well, no. Occupy CreateSpace is in full effect. But you don't need to take my word for it. But do yourself a favor and don't commit to the whole thing like I did. A quick perusal of the Look Inside function at Amazon will show you all you need to know. I mean, do you even need to know anything else about a poem called ‚ÄúDedicated to Cutie‚Äù?

Which leads to the inevitable question: why in the world are you even attempting to publish your work when you haven't even reached the level of mastery where you understand that if you're writing a poem with meter, the stanzas should all conform to that meter?I don't know what book those other eight people read, but I suspect it was not Affections, which is currently the leader in the race for worst book I have read this year.

"Abandoned Mine (Jeff Chamberlain, 2013)Abandoned Mine started off with a bang‚Äîthere are some nifty filmmaking techniques that make it seem like you're going to get something much more than you are from this low-budget horrorfest. For some reason, however, Chamberlain abandons the pretense to the avant-garde once things get rolling, and we end up with a straightforward haunted-mine tale, mediocre but watchable.Plot: Brad (Pearl Harbor's Reiley McClendon) is a post-high-school layabout in a small rural town, bored out of his skull. His ex-girlfriend Laurie (Reservations' Saige Thompson) is back in town, so he cooks up an idea‚Äîthe two of them, Brad's current girlfriend Sharon (Spy Kids' Alexa PenaVega), Laurie's schoolmate Ethan (High School Musical 2's Charan Prabhakar), and Brad's best friend Jim (Radio Flyer's Adam Hendershott), will spend the night near the mouth of the legendary Jarvis Mine, supposedly haunted by the family of the Jarvis that the mine is named for. A thunderstorm drives them inside, and weird things start happening...Unfortunately, none of those weird things are terribly unpredictable; you should be on the right track relatively soon, and from there, aside from some appealing ambiguity as to what's really going on with one of the characters, it unfolds in paint-by-numbers fashion. This has a surprisingly high-powered cast for such a shoestring affair, and despite being stereotypes, the characters are at least affable (I waffled the whole movie on whether Ethan was offensive or the best character in the entire movie). I've seen far worse movies this year, but I've seen far better as well. **","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVSX6XPEVBBPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E58EAJ0#wasThisHelpful","RVSX6XPEVBBPW","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dossie Easton and Janet W. Hardy, The Ethical Slut: A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships, and Other Adventures (2/E) (Celestial Arts, 2009)Perhaps the most important thing to know about The Ethical Slut, if you're just hearing about it for the first time, comes from Annie Sprinkle's blurb on the back. ‚ÄúThe Ethical Slut is one of the most useful relationship books you could ever read, no matter what your lifestyle choices.‚Äù This is indeed the case. Even if you're a committed monogamist (like most folks around the globe today who are in serious relationships), there is a great deal of information in here you can use; given that polyamory is simply an exponential projection of normal relationship dynamics, the books presents a masterclass on the same stuff about relationships that's covered in every other self-help book. And since they're looking at situations that most people will consider absurd, they're going well out beyond what the monogamous will think of as the worst case scenario.  As a result, simply put: this is the best self-help book, not only about relationships, but about anything, that you will ever read.Think of polyamory like cooking. The standard relationship we all think of, two people romantically involved, that's like making a souffle. It's not the easiest thing in the world to do, but as long as you're willing to adapt to your surroundings and follow a few rules, most of which are common-sense, you will end up with something good. Polyamory, well, with each new person you add, you're cooking another dish at the same time. Usually in a different oven, often in a different apartment in the building, and sometimes the equipment in the other place is stuff you're not used to and you end up having to tread very carefully or you're going to wind up with scrambled eggs instead. (You've seen this movie before.) And yet, somehow, thousands of people make it work every day. The levels of communication and empathy involved often feel superhuman to the monogamous, once they overcome the ‚Äúaren't you always jealous?‚Äù phenomenon. And that's where the ‚Äúthis is good advice for the monogamous as well‚Äù factor comes in. Dealing with, say, a breakup in a polyamorous relationship involves a whole bunch of support from other people who love you and take your feelings into account. How is that different from a monogamous relationship? They're friends, and sometimes we don't think to ask. Or if you're in a monogamous relationship and just never think to talk about a topic for some reason? Yeah, you'll learn how to cut that out, 'cause it's usually a bad idea. Learning to think about the idea of gender fluidity in a different way? Par for the course, bub. And these are just tip-of-the-iceberg examples.In short, it doesn't matter who you are, what kind of relationship you're in (including being asexual by choice), or anything else, you are almost guaranteed to find at least one piece of helpful advice in this book. Most will find it a treasure trove of great ideas well worth exploring, capable of taking their relationships to levels beyond anything they would have previously believed. I say it again: this is, as far as I know, the single best self-help book of all time. You need to read this. *****","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MHIQGMDJN99I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1587613379#wasThisHelpful","R3MHIQGMDJN99I","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kathryn and Byron Jackson, The Big Elephant (Golden Press, 1949)The Big Elephant is one of those Golden books from when the company was still, I think, finding its feet and trying to come upon a winning formula for pre-lit. This one doesn't quite get there, though it's not as bad as some of their other experiments (have you read Polly's Pet? [shudder]). I should note, however, that the Jacksons, a year before this, came up with one of Golden's early winners, Busy Timmy, and note in passing that experimentation is a good thing. But this book's one big problem is its repetition, which is so pervasive, and so noticeable, it's the only book from this batch of six that we did not finish the first time through; it took another pass the second night to get all the way to the end of the book. Would have liked to see a rewrite of this one with some of the repetition fixed to see how much the book would have been improved, but almost sixty years later, I'm thinking that's probably impossible, at least with the original authors. **","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LN7IZZE8CBRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RYYVFO#wasThisHelpful","R1LN7IZZE8CBRG","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Watty Piper, The Little Engine that Could (Platt and Munk, 1930)When I was a kid, I was pretty open to reading just about anything, really, and there were very few books I simply did not like. One of them was The Little Engine that Could. Well, a copy of it popped into our house tonight thanks to the mother-in-law, and I read it to the Bean tonight. Forty years later, my opinion of the book has not changed one bit. Repetitive prose, unlikable characters (in the engines who refuse), trite, inspirational resolution...I wouldn't have put things in those words when I was four, of course, at that time all I knew was that I was bored by it compared to other books in my collection of which I wore out multiple copies (Big Max, The Snowy Day, Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears, Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel, I could go on all day), but now, with a quarter-century of analysis and criticism behind me, I can put fingers on why the book rubbed me the wrong way so badly when I was young.

"Sebastien Braun, Digger and Tom (Harper, 2011)Okay, I don't get it. Why did the publisher feel the need to change this book, originally published in England, to have the title Digger and Tom instead of Digger and Skip? You can't seriously think that was a cultural reference that would not be glossed over by the intended audience (or their parents, so you really know anyone who doesn't watch at least one British import home show on TV? I mean, I don't even have cable and I know that one). One way or the other, though, out of the whack of books (six) that came home from the library with mommy and the Bean on Friday, this was the winner (Tubby was the only other one that came close). Digger is a small backhoe who works on a construction site with a number of other machines. The dump truck Tom is his friend, but the rest of the machines look down on him because he's kind of clumsy. When the team runs into a problem they can't solve, Ton encourages Digger to take a whack at it, because digging is his specialty. Pretty standard stuff, but for a construction-equipment-obsessed two-year-old it seems to be the best thing ever. If your kid takes a shine to it, expect to be re-reading this one a lot. Doesn't hold up to that all that well, but it's short and easy, so not a huge problem. ***","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VXRWYFXPWJA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006207752X#wasThisHelpful","R1VXRWYFXPWJA5","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Obviously, if you've got a flock of sheep in a jeep with one driving, you're suspending a modicum of disbelief, but once you've gotten to that level, you don't need to go farther; everything works, everything is internally consistent. With Sheep Blast Off, on the other hand, it seemed almost as if Shaw was trying to outdo herself with every passing page with the silliness. On the other hand, the language is consistent and fun‚Äîif your child is already a fan of the Sheep series, take this one out of the library and give it a look.

Enjoyable, if somewhat slight, and most of the relationships never quite rang true for me (the exception is that between the alleged murderess and the lead investigator); how much you can overlook that likely determines how much you'll end up liking it.

"La Casa de las Sombres (The House of Shadows) (Ricardo Wullicher, 1976)Odd Argentine/US hybrid mystery that attempted to do giallo without any of the operatic cinematography or over-the-top gore scenes, with the expected result. Take away those things that make giallo what it is and you're left with the parts that fans routinely overlook, namely the thin characters and anemic plot, with only a bit of faux-psychedelic camera trickery to give the same away (e.g., when Audrey witnesses the murder).

"From a Whisper to a Scream (Jeff Burr, 1987)I've said a great deal about American attempts to make horror anthology films since Creepshow, and it feels silly to reiterate it all here. From a Whisper to a Scream is another of those American anthology films where the framing device ends up working better than any of the stories therein, but unlike many movies of that stripe, the shorts in this one range from competent to pretty durned good, and the cast they dug up for this thing is pretty spectacular, with Vincent Price as the framing device's narrator and a solid B-movie cast with names like Clu Galager, Susan Tyrrell, Larry Kiser, and Lawrence Tierney delivering the fun. I wish Burr had pushed a little harder to try and send this one into the realms of Creepshow (though in hindsight‚ÄîBurr's later output would include Pumpkinhead II and the fourth and fifth Puppet Master movies‚Äîhe simply might not have had it in him), but what we got is watchable enough if you're looking for a handful of short, sharp shocks. ***","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UW1U7QJROFTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A7LR96#wasThisHelpful","R2UW1U7QJROFTQ","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Reeds (Nick Cohen, 2010)The Reeds is not a bad little film, certainly not one deserving of the kind of calumny it has received around the Internet (4.6 at IMDB, 10%[!!] at Rotten Tomatoes).

A group of young-and-beautifuls head out of the city to spend a weekend boating in the middle of nowhere...but ‚Äúmiddle of nowhere‚Äù turns out to be a much more accurate description than they were hoping, and the reeds are home to all sorts of the kinds of noises that make people wonder just how alone they are on the desolate moor.

"Lew Daly, Swallowing the Scroll: Late in a Prophetic Tradition with Susan Howe and John Taggart (M Press, 1991)Before Lew Daly was a famous, big-time policy wonk, he was a literary critic. (Full disclosure: I didn't realize Lew Daly was a famous, big-time policy wonk until I was looking up information on Swallowing the Scroll last week. There days, Daly is far more known for books like God and the Welfare State and Unjust Deserts: How the Rich Are Taking Our Common Inheritance and Why We Should Take It Back.) I am going to make the assumption, given the accolades on his biography page at the New Economics Institute, that one of the major changes he made while getting from point A to point B was learning how to take ‚Äúcritic-speak‚Äù‚Äîthat often-unintelligible jargon that makes the public shy away from books of lit-crit‚Äîand transform it into something that the public will actually buy and read. Here's a representative passage, chosen at random, from Swallowing the Scroll:‚ÄúReturning only as a poetry in this pattern of both longing and solicitude, another origin begins to loom: if we are bold enough to call into question, rather than simply redistribute the category of the masculine, then a disruption at the divide of the feminine‚Äîthe prophetic feminine from beyond and otherwise independent of any essence, further from closure than any process, more absent than nothingness, yet  more irrepressibly constitutive than the materiality of nature‚Äîenters into all continuums as a scourge, and into discord as a salve.‚Äù (--66)I'm going to bet money there aren't any passages that read like that in Unjust Deserts.The above is going to be the biggest drawback for anyone who's not used to literary criticism, and as should be obvious, this is not lit-crit for beginners. (Daly mentions in the preface that this started out as a review, which for me adds another dimension; how does one review a review?) But if we put that aside, how's the book? Not bad. Daly, through the ancient filter of poetry-as-prophecy, takes a look at new (at that time) books by Susan Howe (The Nonconformist's Memorial) and John Taggart (Loop). As is often the case in reviews, he focuses on a single poem as synecdochic of the collection and dives pretty deep into it; this is the part that took this from a five-thousand-word review to a ninety-six-page essay. It's good stuff, as long as you have an ear for the language. That can be a tough barrier, though. Worth checking out if it's up your alley and you're not a lit-crit beginner; if you are, you might want to start with someone in the field who writes for a more general audience‚ÄîNancy Ann Watanabe or Terry Eagleton or Jodie Medd, as examples‚Äîand work your way up to Daly. ** Ω","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23446PQ68QTI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1879645084#wasThisHelpful","R23446PQ68QTI8","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Road (John Hillcoat, 2009)It has been a long time since I've read The Road‚ÄîI got an ARC of it from a pal of mine at CNN before its release and read it immediately‚Äîso when I finally sat down to watch the movie, my memories of the book were hazy at best. I know relying on my memory of a book I read eight years ago is probably not the best thing in the world to do when comparing a film adaptation to it, but I remember, for what that's worth, the book not being anywhere near as unfocused and episodic as the movie.Then Robert Duvall gave that brilliant monologue*, and I no longer cared.Plot: the world has effectively ended. (While the film, true to the book, never reveals the exact cause of the end of humanity, both the book's descriptions and the movie's subdued lighting will call to mind the vivid descriptions of nuclear winter anyone of a certain age was fed.) Two characters we know only as Man (The Prophecy's Viggo Mortensen) and Boy (Let Me In's Kodi Smit-McPhee) are wandering the post-apocalyptic landscape along the titular road. They may have a goal; they may not. (I have always assumed they were going to some legendary ‚Äúsafe zone‚Äù, but that is probably me projecting onto this from a hundred unrelated zombie movies.) They do their best to avoid the roving bands of cannibals; food is scarce, so human beings have turned to eating one another when they cannot find anything else. Man tells us, in a voiceover, that he fears only two things: cannibals and hunger. You find out why soon enough. The present-day pieces are interspersed with dreams, memories, and reflections Man has of the pre-apocalypse days, with his wife (Monster's Charlize Theron) and, when they stumble upon Man's childhood home, of things even before that. They discover a few more friendly fellow travelers along the way, but this is the only escape from the drudgery of their daily lives.Mortensen and Smit-McPhee are both top-tier actors, and the two of them should be enough to carry this symbolism-laden film, especially when paired with John Hillcoat (The Proposition), who was the perfect director to take on this source material. And yet still, what stood out to me were the cameos. A number of very well-known actors show up here in minor parts; I've already mentioned Duvall, and then there are Guy Pearce and Molly Parker as a married couple, Michael Kenneth Williams, Garret Dillahunt... each graces the screen for less than five minutes (Theron doesn't have much more than that), and each shines. Williams is a perfect archetype of the desperation of those survivors who have not joined one of the cannibal gangs in a way that Mortensen never is, though by all rights he should be. Pearce delivers the one-liner that is the moral to the entire story and still manages to pass it off in such a way that you might miss it if you blink. (I was reminded, favorably, of the immortal final shot of Dellamorte Dell'Amore.) Because of this, I ended up having to conclude that neither of our main characters is pulling much of the weight in this movie. I am now very happy I didn't end up seeing it until after Let Me In and ParaNorman had already made me a rabid Smit-McPhee fan.Now having said all that, I know I'm harping on the negative aspects of a movie that I'm giving a rating of ‚Äúyou really should see this‚Äù and considering adding to the thousand-best list. I don't mean to. Blame it on the movie's relentlessly bleak atmosphere, which I rush to add is perfectly appropriate for the material. And it's obvious from the film's reception, both critical (75% at Rotten Tomatoes) and popular (68% RT, 7.3 at IMDB), that its general plotlessness didn't hamstring it, the way that sort of thing does with so many movies. (I ascribe the credit, or blame, for this solely to Hillcoat, whose mastery of celluloid shows new aspects with every movie he releases.)  The movie does take a while to get up to speed, and it is intentionally (I assume) confusing/disorienting for a bit. Also, you have to pay attention to it or you'll miss some of the more important bits, none of which I can tell you without major spoilers. Trust me, it's worth paying the extra attention when one of them rolls around. Hillcoat takes a lot of time setting up most of his characters, even the minor ones, which make the movie feel slow. Don't let that deter you; this is one you will find yourself mulling over long after the final frame has passed your eyes. *** ¬Ω* According to IMDB's trivia section, Duvall's monologue is at least partly extemporaneous; when I read this, that little ‚ÄúI KNEW it!‚Äù light clicked in my head. It feels a little off with the rest of the script, and ends up marking the movie's turning point. It may be complete coincidence that it falls where it does, though I suspect once they realized the gold they had, some editorial prowess was put to use subtly emphasizing the importance of that monologue. In any case, if you don't watch the movie for any other reason, watch it for this scene; it is the post-apocalyptic equivalent of Michael Fassbender's riveting monologue in Hunger.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q04JCCQPSCD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FB5634#wasThisHelpful","R3Q04JCCQPSCD5","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mervyn Peake, Titus Groan (Tusk/Overlook, 1946)[originally posted 26Feb2002]Few fantasy epics are as revered as Mervin Peake‚Äôs Gormenghast novels, and for good reason. Gormenghast‚Äôs first novel, Titus Groan, is four hundred pages of such sterling descriptive language, such deliciously surreal diction, that it‚Äôs easy to forget that fifty pages have passed since the last event occurred. Peake gives himself away a little over halfway through with one singularly important sentence: ""It was not certain what significance the ceremony held, for unfortunately the records were lost, but the formality was no less sacred for being unintelligible."" Indeed.Titus himself, while always the central focus of the novel, is barely getting into the toddler stage as the book closes. We spend much more time getting to know some of the key players in the quotidian intrigues that give Gormenghast its color. Most notably, we are apprised of a longstanding hatred between Flay, the first servant to the Earl of Gormenghast, and Swelter, the head chef. Also, we are introduced to Steerpike, an escaped kitchen servant, who at first seems nothing more than a catalyst for the hatred between Flay and Swelter (after escaping Swelter, the first person Steerpike encounters is Flay, who instead of returning him, imprisons him), but ends up being the catalyst for many, if not all, of the changes we see in Gormenghast over the course of this novel.While only three books in the series were published, and the very beginnings of a fourth, Titus Awakes, have been uncovered in Peake‚Äôs papers, it is obvious from the scope of Titus Groan that Peake had planned an epic of unimaginable length and detail. This is not a novel for those who have little patience with books where the plot is slow-moving; for lovers of the language in which books are written, Titus Groan is a must-read, perhaps the only other twentieth-century work that can stand up stylistically to the works of H. P.

"Carolyn Steele, A Year on Planet Alzheimer (and a Little Longer in Canada) (AuthorHouse, 2004)I am, as a rule, not a fan of memoirs. They've gotta do two things to make me sit up and take notice. First, you have to have done something that's actually worthy of writing a memoir about. (That running joke in Tove Jansson's books about Moominpappa writing his memoirs? That really WAS a joke in the fifites. Now, it's business as usual.) Second, your life can't be the sole purpose of the book's existence; you have to spend at least as much time talking about that bit in Part One as you do about what you ate for lunch every Tuesday. This is on top of all of the other strictures about what makes a book good‚Äîcharacter development, pacing, etc. (Oh, you thought those were only worth paying attention to in fiction? Try reading 100 Strokes of the Brush Before Bed to find out just how bad a nonfiction book with no pacing or character development can be. Yes, it's a memoir.) A Year on Planet Alzheimer fits both bills. It's not a perfect book by any means, and both the jacket copy and the book itself play something of a part in that (more on this later), but as far as memoirs go, it's one of the better ones I've read in recent memory; the last one I remember liking this much was Alison Bechdel's Fun Home, which (I just checked) I read back in 2006.Carolyn Steele, at a loose end in her native England, finds herself with wanderlust. She's always wanted to see Canada, so she starts applying for home care positions. She finds one that seems to suit, caring for the elderly mother of a woman named Pat in the town of Kitchener, Ontario, while Pat is involved with building a house in Newfoundland. After mountains of paperwork, she and her son head off for a two-year stint in Canada. I can't say that's where the weirdness begins, as anyone who's left a country for any amount of time can attest to. (But when you're going for that long, well, the paperwork gets worse. Exponentially so.) But, as expected, culture shock sets in, and Steele keeps a clear enough head about things to report on it, provide a translation guide, and generally keep her wits about her. (As long as she remembers to drive on the correct side of the road.) Things rarely go as planned, however, and as tensions mount and things that were supposed to go smoothly don't, along with unexpected difficulties popping up (how does one transport a bicycle across a country without paying a small fortune?), as much as Steele and her son start thinking of Canada as home, the lure of the familiar is always beckoning.I alluded to the book's biggest failing above, and the irony of it is that had the book not thrown down that particular gauntlet, it would never have occurred to me to make the comparison in question. However, both the back cover copy and at least one place in the text have Steele (I am assuming she, like most authors using vanity/self/POD presses, wrote her own jacket copy) comparing her work to that of Bill Bryson. I'm not the world's biggest Bryson disciple‚ÄîI've found his work to be inconsistent, and he's not above quirking the facts a bit to get a better joke, but that's still some pretty big shoes to fill. I don't think Steele was quite up to the task; this is in no small part because Bryson is a travel writer, and any memoir-ish qualities in his writing play third fiddle at best. Steele is a memoirist who has adopted travel writing as the platform on which she's going to bounce her personal recollections. And I rush to reiterate that she does a very good job with that balance, and this is quite an enjoyable piece of work as a result; even people who aren't fans of memoirs may find this one worth reading, if a little oversold. I can attest to this firsthand. ***","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J9D0QSRWDHPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481834983#wasThisHelpful","R2J9D0QSRWDHPG","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mary Biddinger, A Sunny Place with Adequate Water (Black Lawrence Press, 2014)I'm not entirely sure what more I can say about Mary Biddinger that I haven't said in my reviews of her previous two full-length books, Prairie Fever and O Holy Insurgency, and her chapbook Saint Monica.

"Jason Bovberg, Blood Red (Permuted Press, 2014)full disclosure: a copy of this book was provided to me free of charge by the author.I could tell you that I stayed up well past my bedtime the first night I dug into Blood Red, the first book in Jason Bovberg's trilogy of the same name, to see if I could get to the halfway point before passing out. (I did.) I could tell you I skipped meals on the second day I was reading Blood Red because I had every intention of finishing it. (I did.) I could tell you that soon after I finished it, I posted on Bovberg's wall and did something I have never, ever done before: asked him if I could alpha-read the second book in the trilogy. (I will. Despite the fact that I warned Jason that I used to be a professional proofreader and never got out of the habit.) Instead, I think I'll just tell you that if you're a fan of good, solid horror novels, you need to get your hands on a copy of Blood Red pronto.Rachel wakes up one Saturday morning, after having a fight with her father the night before over staying out too late with her boyfriend, and discovers that the world has gone to hell. Somewhat literally. A peek into her father and stepmother's bedroom reveals that Susannah, the stepmom, has suffered some sort of horrible trauma‚Äîand touching her causes Rachel to have some problems as well (that will haunt her throughout the novel). As if that weren't bad enough, when she goes outside to try and find help, she discovers that her stepmother is far from the only person who's having a problem. In fact, by the time she's started coming up with any sort of plan, she's half-convinced she's the only living person left in Fort Collins, Colorado. That turns out not to be the case‚Äîshe and Alan, a neighbor she never knew beyond nodding, find a young girl with far more extensive damage than Rachel and head to the hospital with her, where they discover a small band of survivors. Just when everything has calmed down a bit and they all turn their minds to figuring out what's going on...the legions of dead start twitching.No, it's not a zombie novel, despite Permuted's name being on the spine. (I won't tell you what it is, but I came to the conclusion the characters do towards the end of the book around page ten or so.) The reanimated dead have a few zombie-like qualities, but you will rapidly come to think of them more like the zombies in David Moody's first Autumn novel, before they start getting mad at the living, when they're still just wandering around looking emo. The zombie-novel structure is there, but Bovberg does some very interesting things with it‚Äîthings that, when you pause to consider them, make perfect sense. He also takes the tack of writing a book that straddles the line between adult and YA, and that strikes me as a very good move in today's book culture. (For the record, while I couldn't tell which market he was actually aiming for the entire length of the book, during the last chapter I tilted slightly towards adult‚Äîdespite said last chapter being exactly what one would expect from a YA novel. I still haven't quite figured out my thought process there yet.)As far as downsides go, well, I can't think of terribly many. I wouldn't have minded seeing a few of the minor characters fleshed out more, though whenever I have the criticism of the first novel in a series, I always assume they will get developed later on. There are a few stylistic choices I would have made differently, but that's always a personal thing and your mileage is guaranteed to vary. This is a solid trilogy debut, and I am greatly looking forward to seeing if the next two books are just as good. *** ¬Ω","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL4KM6JQASTP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JK1UW4E#wasThisHelpful","RL4KM6JQASTP0","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Skyfall (Sam Mendes, 2012)A little less than an hour into Skyfall, it was too late to stay awake, so I paused it and went to bed. The next morning, I asked on Facebook if I was the only one who found it a confused, muddled mess, and given the outpouring of love for it, wondered if it got better. The unanimous answer was yes, it got a lot better, so I went back to it that evening. Less than a minute after I turned the movie back on, there was Javier Bardem. Javier Bardem has the almost singular quality of making every movie he appears in a better work, and his presence in Skyfall was sorely needed. It stayed better after that, and for that I was truly grateful.As we open, Bond (Daniel Craig in his third outing as 007) is in the throes of trying to save a fellow agent, Ronson (TV stalwart Bill Buckhurst in his first feature appearance), who is in danger of death, against the express orders of M (Judi Dench) and Eve (28 Days Later...'s Naomie Harris), the third operative on the team. Things go south, and we end the sequence with Bond hiding away somewhere in the tropics, turning his love of a good shaken-not-stirred martini into a nightmarish bout with dependency until he chances on a new report about a terrorist attack on MI6 headquarters. Bond returns, only to have M tell him that before he can go back out into the field, he has to pass all the tests again. And all this while trying to figure out who's got MI6 on the defensive, and how he seems to know so much about their movements, defenses, and infrastructure...I ended up looking at that first hour as setup‚Äîa whole lot of setup. And I am not sure the movie would have worked without it. This is a very meta Bond; if you were to look at a spy movie where the main character wasn't known for quaffing martinis, the slip into alcoholism in the tropics wouldn't be nearly as meaningful, and that's only one of the places where the film pays lip service to updating the character for modern sensibilities. (The new version of Q, amusingly played by The Zero Theorem's Ben Whishaw, is the most notable bend in this angle; the new Q has dropped the focus on gadgets and is far more interested in cyberterrorism. For the good guys, of course.) This almost by definition makes the film vertical-market; if you are not already an established fan of the series, Skyfall will not only not do anything to convince you, it may well drive you off. And yet, once the film takes off, Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, and Albert Finney as Skyfall's caretaker (the film's namesake estate, the Bond family pile in Scotland) all turn in their A levels with aplomb. This is the Daniel Craig of Layer Cake, the Judi Dench of Iris, the Albert Finney of The Dresser. And Bardem? He just has to show up to bring his top-level game; I can think of a single Bardem movie I've seen where he didn't tear the screen apart (For the record, it was D√≠as Contados, I've seen eleven Bardem films, and he was the star of the movie that has topped my top 1000 movies list since 2000, Before Night Falls). Mendes directing his first non-R film may have been a strength rather than a weakness; he flirted with that line every chance he could, and in the process managed his most successful blend of talkiness and action yet. Well, seventy-two minutes of it, anyway. Pity about the first hour. If you're already invested in the series, you need to see it, but then you don't need a review to tell you that. If you're not, start with something more accessible‚Äîeither version of Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, and A View to a Kill are all good starting points for the series. ***","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CM0AWNBHU7SO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B5HQL50#wasThisHelpful","R3CM0AWNBHU7SO","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Butcher Boys (Duane Graves and Justin Meeks, 2012)I spend a decent amount of time trolling the bottom of my sorted (by average rating) Netflix queue, looking for those movies that have a horrible rating that are actually pretty good. I've come across a few here and there that are neglected for whatever reason. The Butcher Boys, Texas Chainsaw Massacre writer Kim Henkel's first feature script in eighteen years, is the latest of those. I have no idea what movie the public who rated this movie a collective one and a half stars were watching, but it must not have been Butcher Boys.Plot: Sissy (Breaking Dawn's Ali Faulkner) is celebrating her seventeenth birthday at a swanky restaurant in Austin, Texas, that's under protest by a band of radical vegetarians. (While I can't tell you why without spoilers, this becomes important later.) When she, her brother Mikey (Dear Sidewalk's Philip Wolf), and their friends Barbie (The Big Picture's Tory Tompkins) and Benny (Hallettsville's Derek Lee Nixon) are on their way home, a series of minor misadventures end up with them crossing paths with the Butcher Boys (also known as the Boneboys, which was the film's original title), who are out for the kind of good time that involves kidnapping random folks and taking them back to the basement of Austin's hottest new restaurant, J. Swift's.Okay, the movie's main drawback is very easy to point out, and is just as minor as it sounds: this movie contains two of the worst body-double shots in cinema history. If you combine the two, they take up less than a second of screen time, so that can't be what everyone's up in arms about. And the movie certainly does have its reliance on Henkel's older, far better-known script; before I realized Henkel had written it, I was planning on giving them a few snaps up for nailing modern takes on certain classic TCM scenes (the dinner, especially). They still deserve it. There are a few times this feels like ‚Äúwhat The Texas Chainsaw Massacre would have been like if it had been written as a comedy‚Äù; given the popularity, if not the quality, of the movie's many sequels (and a remake or two that took that tack), it's not a bad idea. IMDB's trivia section mentions that this was originally Henkel's script for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre II, but he pulled it out and re-worked it with the aim of turning The Butcher Boys into a new franchise. That, too, is deserved; given a little time and room to grow, this might grow away from its ancestor and become something even better than it is now. It's still singing in someone else's voice, but the lyrics are pretty darn good so far. *** ¬Ω","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3991MW8US6MDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EE6ICIS#wasThisHelpful","R3991MW8US6MDF","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Tribe, Abe Messiah (Sanctuary, 2001)[originally posted 19Feb2002]These days, it‚Äôs the rare country on the planet that hasn‚Äôt been made aware of the New Zealand young adult-themed show The Tribe. America is, unfortunately, one of those rare countries, thanks in no small part to the operating budget of the channel (WAM, a part of the Encore/Starz network) that has exclusive American rights to the show. The Tribe has been making waves all over Europe and Asia; the upcoming season 1 DVD releases are in the top 2,000 ranked Amazon purchases at amazon.co.uk on preorders alone. Why? Because aside from the obvious draw of soap opera, the show‚Äôs producers, Cloud 9 Entertainment, did their best to come up with a top-notch cast of actors. Most every main character in the show, and not a small number of minor folks, have a respectable number of film and theater credits backing them up given their ages. Some of them also have relatively extensive musical backgrounds. So the producers hatched on an idea‚Äîwhy not have the cast sing the John Williams-written theme song? Meryl Cassie (Ebony, on the show) took lead vocals on the opening theme, and the closer is an ensemble piece. Both hit the charts almost overnight. Next logical step: an album.I never thought I‚Äôd say it, but John Williams, phone home. Only a scattering of the other songs on the album approach the genuinely likable show-framers, ""The Dream Must Stay Alive"" and ""Abe Messiah"" (both here, thankfully). It‚Äôs hard to fault the producers of a TV show for teens and starring teens for coming up with the idea that they should try to imitate ‚ÄòN Sync and Britney Spears as much as possible, until you realize that one of the things that makes those first two pieces so fine is their complete lack of SyncSpearsness. Oops. The album also shows signs of the same overproduction that tried (and failed) to make just another pop star out of Michelle Branch; while the main vocalists here (Cassie, Caleb Ross, and Vanessa Stacey) are all at least in the same league as Branch on vocal delivery, it‚Äôs be nice to see what happened if Cloud 9 gave them a shot at writing their own material.Okay, now that I‚Äôve spent two paragraphs complaining about the album I should probably explain why I‚Äôm giving it three and a half stars. It‚Äôs above-average SyncSpearsness, and there are a few other tracks that are clearly worth repeat listens (""Abadeo"" and ""You Belong to Me"" being the first two that really caught me). Mostly, though, it‚Äôs for ""The Dream Must Stay Alive"" and ""Abe Messiah."" Hey Cloud 9‚Äîif you happen to be reading this review, you can quintuple (at least) your American fan baseovernight by releasing these two as a single and getting the show on a basic cable network. Trust me on this. *** ¬Ω","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38WZOJXKRJFKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000C6VW6#wasThisHelpful","R38WZOJXKRJFKX","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"George Lanning, The Pedestal (Avon, 1966)I first discovered Avon's series of red-spined quasi-horror tales in the very early eighties; I can remember where I was (North Carolina), and why (we were there with friends of my parents for Thanksgiving break), but the year eludes me. 1983? In any case, one of my obsessions in high school was used bookstores, and I found every one in the small seaside town where we stayed the week. In one of them, I found Helen McCloy's Mister Splitfoot, a 1969 gothic that was my first red-spine, and to this day is my favorite of the bunch. I have spent many years since going to used bookstores to hunt for more red-spines, among many other things. My most recent find was this little number, which has a great deal more in common with the trip I was on when I bought that copy of Mister Splitfoot than it does with Helen McCloy's estimable novel.Johnny Bayden and his wife Eleanor, formerly city dwellers, have repaired to the backwoods while Johnny recovers from a stay in the hospital. They are wealthy folk; they have a large house on the right side of the tracks, the only person not of their social stratus they interact with is their gossipy housekeeper, they tend to avoid going out where other people will be unless it's to the country club or church. You know the type. All seems well until they attend a local dispersal auction and, on impulse, buy a large, dark, hardwood pedestal. Johnny believes that the most pressing thing he will have to consider where it is concerned is what decorative item to put atop it, to best catch the light from the French doors in the conservatory. (Actually, I don't remember if he uses the word ‚Äúconservatory‚Äù, but the description pretty much screamed it.) He quickly finds that he is wrong. The first night it is in the house, he hears a scratching noise, but finds no one in the house. The next morning, he finds faint scratches around the base of the pedestal. As time goes on (and tensions between Johnny and Eleanor mount, exacerbated by an affair Johnny is convinced Eleanor is having), Johnny gathers evidence that points to the conclusion that the pedestal is in some way possessed, and is capable of moving about the house on its own. Gradually, through the housekeeper, rumors start filtering into the house of murders happening over on the other side of the tracks. And it doesn't take Johnny long to realize that every time one occurs, he's heard the pedestal scratching its way around the house...I stumbled upon Kirkus' (surprisingly effusive) [https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/george-lanning/the-pedestal/] review of this novel, which mentions that Lanning was, at the time, an editor at The Kenyon Review. I guarantee you I would never have pegged him as such. Not that the novel doesn't have literary pretensions; it does indeed, though Lanning had yet to master the art of the literature-with-a-capital-L ambiguous ending. (I did not appreciate this book enough to go see if he wrote any others/whether he eventually did master it). Given the timeframe and this new bit of information, however, a comparison I never would have thought about making suddenly crashes through the wall as if it were the Kool-Aid guy as played by Cthulhu himself: suddenly I can't see anything but Fred Chappell's 1968 southern gothic/horror novel Dagon. (Chappell‚Äîwho disowned Dagon for many years, keeping it out of print until Boson Books was allowed to publish a new edition in 2002‚Äîwas a professor at UNC-Greensboro when Dagon was published.) Dagon is the work of a young writer, and one who was at the time primarily a poet, and it shows; it's ham-handed and cheesy, and I wish I could find a way to work in a pumpernickel reference there, but above all it's fun. I have long considered it the direct spiritual ancestor of what is, in my opinion, the best southern gothic novel of all time, Tom Piccirilli's A Choir of Ill Children. I can't imagine Lanning's novel being the spiritual ancestor of anything, save possibly the need for an extra-strong dose of bromo-seltzer. Dagon, while touching on deadly serious themes that may be a bit too big for its britches, never loses touch with the idea that southern gothic is as much about vamp and glam as it is about darkness and despair. The Pedestal is consistently as serious as Parkinson's, and roughly as curable. By the time you get to the end, which makes Dagon seem a masterpiece of subtlety, you may find yourself wondering why you've spent the last hundred fifty pages with these sad sacks only to get to a Big Reveal so transparent you had it figured out by the end of chapter three. **","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSEW5MGWMUOIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007F7OLG#wasThisHelpful","RSEW5MGWMUOIO","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jordan Krall (ed.), Mighty in Sorrow: A Tribute to David Tibet and Current 93 (Dynatox Ministries, 2014)If you're a fan of British Dark Folk band Current 93, you don't need me to tell you you need this book. This isn't a review for the established fans; this is one for the folks who may not have ever heard of C93, or its brilliant, insane, workaholic, polymath of a frontman, David Tibet. Tibet is a man of wide-ranging, often obsessive interests, from the mundane (Enid Blyton's relentlessly optimistic elf Noddy, Louis Wain's cat portraits) to the dangerously ‚Äúevil‚Äù (the works of Aleister Crowley and Byron Gysin). All of which makes his music endlessly fascinating, once you've developed a taste for it. More to the point, it serves as the broadest of launching pads for a literary tribute. Tribute albums come out all the time, with other, usually lesser, bands covering the work of the masters. When's the last time you heard of a tribute book to a musician? The rarity of the concept alone should draw you in.I can't remember the last time‚Äîif ever‚ÄîI came across an anthology that isn't variable in quality. Mighty in Sorrow is no different, but I stress that this is a book that comes down heavily on the side of the angels. I've already thrown around very good words about the collection's centerpiece, excerpts from In a Foreign Town, In a Foreign Land, which Thomas Ligotti wrote in collaboration with Tibet during the nineties, and ‚ÄúMourn Not the Sleepless Children‚Äù, Bob Freeman's tale that, coincidentally, I ran across in Burning Effigy Press' chapbook Fresh Blood just a few months ago. I've also thrown around good words about a few other writers who appear in this collection, though not about these specific pieces, Nicole Cushing (whose How to Eat Fried Furries is a bizarro treat) and Hyacinthe L. Raven (whose closing poem here is not quite up to the level of the work in her recent collection Seventy Times Seven, but it would be cruel of me to hold just about anything up to that level and expect it not to wilt).  Of what is left, three new-to-me authors really stood out. Ross E. Lockhart's ‚ÄúA Garden of Cucumbers‚Äù is somber, middle Eastern, full of the mystic, the magic, and the mournful. James Champagne's ‚ÄúThe Withering Echo‚Äù is the most musical story in the collection, and perhaps the one that cleaves most closely to the spirit of Thomas Ligotti (who, in my head, is somewhat inseparable from Tibet); a chap obsessed with a sixties psychedelic rock band travels to their hometown and finds out far more than he expected to. The real winner of the collection, however, is one Ian Delacroix. I have never heard of Ian Delacroix before. He seems to be Italian; in any case, the only book Amazon lists by him as of this writing is in Italian, Il Grande Notturno, and costs sixty bucks used. But isn't that a title that says ‚Äúbuy me now!‚Äù? And after you've read ‚ÄúThe Man of Crosses‚Äù (a title that puts me more in mind of C93's labelmates Sol Invictus than it does Tibet and co., but I'm not complaining), you, too, may well consider trying to learn Italian just so you can pay sixty bucks for this book.As for the... less compelling...work to be found here, I won't say it's bad. But it doesn't hold a candle to the best work here. (Rule of thumb: if the title is all in lowercase, proceed with caution.)I will stress again, however, that the number of pieces in this book that won't make you wonder why it took you so long to buy this book is far smaller than the number of pieces that will. Sometimes creepy, sometimes funny, sometimes enlightening, always intriguing, Mighty in Sorrow is a collection that will have you wanting to hunt down more work by a number of the artists therein; that is never a bad thing at all. *** Ω","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A2OQEFJU7O0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615990045#wasThisHelpful","R3A2OQEFJU7O0D","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hell's House (Howard Higgin, 1932)Hell's House still exists in the public consciousness solely because of Bette Davis. That's a literal statement‚Äîthe movie was thought lost for years, until Davis passed away and her personal film collection was donated to the National Archives; a copy of Hell's House was discovered therein. It was Davis' sixth feature, made when she was still in her early twenties (all five of her previous features were made in 1931); it was also co-lead Pat O'Brien's sixth. But both of these big-name stars pale in comparison, in this potboiler, to the movie's real star, Junior Durkin. Durkin is very little remembered these days thanks to his untimely death in a 1935 road accident (he was only nineteen years old), but he was big business in the early thirties; his very little screen output included playing Huck Finn in both Tom Sawyer (1930) and Huckleberry Finn (1931) and Franz in Phil Rosen's 1934 adaptation of Little Men. While Hell's House is a potboiler, and Davis and O'Brien give it about the treatment it deserves, Durkin throws himself into the role in a way one rarely sees in movies like this. I mean, we're talking Edward-G-Robinson-in-Scarface here.Plot: O'Brien plays Matt Kelly, a bootlegger in the days when that was a profitable business. Durkin plays Jimmy, one of Kelly's hangers-on. After a job gone bad, Jimmy gets nabbed for a minor crime Kelly committed. After refusing to snitch, Jimmy is sent to a reform school that make the conditions on the Island of Doomed Men seem downright hospitable. While there, he befriends Shorty (the great character actor Frank Coughlin Jr. in one of his few credited roles), who has a heart condition exacerbated by the brutal treatment he receives there. Once Jimmy gets out, he enlists Kelly and Kelly's girlfriend Peggy (Davis)  to help spread the word about the deplorable reform school and bring its tyrant of a headmaster (James A. Marcus, another often-uncredited character actor) to justice.Yes, it's a genre thriller, predictable and manipulative, an otherwise forgettable product of its time save the fame its two leads would go onto and the once-in-a-lifetime performance given by a child star whose ascent to fame was cruelly ended. But those things make it interesting, at least, as a piece of cinematic history; if you're a student of the early days of film, it's worth checking out on that angle. Others can take it or leave it as they will. **","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG4BSB4WGZ18J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUSYTQW#wasThisHelpful","RG4BSB4WGZ18J","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One from the Heart (Francis Ford Coppola, 1982)One from the Heart initially stuck in my head because of Sneak Previews, the original Siskel and Ebert movie review show back when it was on public television. My favorite section of the show was always the Dog of the Week, at the end, when each critic would highlight the worst film he'd seen that week. I got a lot of recommendations from the Dog of the Week. That, naturally, led to a year-end list of the ten worst movies of the year. If a movie showed up on the Ten Worst list, I was almost guaranteed a good time. One from the Heart was on Gene Siskel's ten worst list for 1982; if I recall correctly, it was #1. (Pretty much anything that made their lists from that year is gold; they also included Inchon,  Pink Floyd: The Wall, and Halloween III.) But I'd never gotten a chance to see it until recently. While Coppola has always been an on-and-off director for me, I've found over the years that it's pretty hard to go wrong with Frederic Forrest, and with One from the Heart, Forrest gets a rare starring role. It's not the best movie in the world‚Äîcertainly not in the same league as Forrest's other major 1982 film, Hammett‚Äîbut it's certainly not one of 1982's worst movies.Plot: Hank (Forrest) and Frannie (Tootsie's Teri Garr) have been living together for coming up on ten years. The two of them have settled into boredom and routine, and Frannie has had enough; she announces, on the eve of their fifth anniversary, that she's leaving. Hank puts up token resistance, but when it comes right down to it, he's more perturbed by the disturbing of the routine. Soon after, the two of them meet their dream mates in Ray (Tempest's Raul Julia) and Leila (Cat People's Nastassja Kinski), but Hank soon realizes that dream girl or no dream girl, Frannie is the one he really loves. What lengths is he willing to go to in order to get her back?Read as a straight film, One from the Heart does indeed make very little sense. I hesitate to speculate on Coppola's mental state (or state of inebriation) at the time he was making this movie, but asking oneself ‚Äúwhat was everyone involved in this movie smoking?‚Äù on a regular basis will not put you too many standard deviations away from the norm. On the other hand, if you read this as Coppola's attempt‚Äîand one should always remember that Coppola began his career in the Corman factory with the similarly off the wall Dementia 13 almost twenty years before this‚Äîto make a psychedelic musical, the way L. Q. Jones had tried to make a psychedelic science fiction film seven years before with A Boy and His Dog, One from the Heart starts making a little more sense. The plot's fuzziness, the somewhat puerile sense of humor on occasion, the sometimes silly decisions made by the characters. It all falls into place. That doesn't excuse the movie's shortcomings, but at least it allows you to have some fun with them. ** ¬Ω","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q8JDXY7QH1PV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000YRL8K#wasThisHelpful","R1Q8JDXY7QH1PV","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Den du Frygter (Fear Me Not) (Kristian Levring, 2008)It would be possible to write an entirely accurate review of Fear Me Not in exactly eleven words. ‚ÄúUlrich Thomsen. Paprika Steen. What more do you need to know?‚Äù Amazon, however, required reviewers to write at least twenty, so I might as well go whole hog and tell you more, for those of you (there may be a few out there) for whom Thomsen (Adam's Apples) and Steen (Applause) are not automatic selling points.The two of them play a married couple, Mikael and Sigrid. Mikael has taken a leave of absence from work for an undisclosed reason; we can reasonably assume it has to do with his anxiety and depression, which he attempts to hide from Sigrid and their daughter Selma (Magi I Luften's Emma Sehested Hoeg) as much as possible. (He doesn't do a very good job of it, but the two of them are willfully blind to his condition, Sigrid more so.) One of the few routines he is still clinging to is rowing a few mornings a week with his friend and brother-in-law Frederik (Terribly Happy's Lars Brygman), a doctor whose hospital is about to start a trial of a new anti-anxiety medication. Mikael asks if he can get in on it; Frederik reluctantly agrees. At first, everything seems to be going swimmingly; Mikael becomes cheerful, connects with his family, starts talking about going back to work. But then, the changes start taking a darker turn.A few months before I watched Fear Me Not, I watched Side Effects, the latest (as of this writing) film from Steven Soderbergh, which covers, at least in its first third, a very similar scenario. I was not terribly fond of Side Effects, though I did like that first bit some. Fear Me Not has shown me why I was dissatisfied with a good deal of it. Soderbergh used this idea, of a drug trial gone hideously wrong, as the springboard to something else, and he put very little thought into that part of the film as a result; Rooney Mara's character went bonkers, and that set the scene for his real movie. Here, on the other hand, it is the real movie; this is what the press for Side Effects wanted you to believe it was, and Levring (The Intended) manages, with very little effort, to create a sense of palpable menace. Excellently-drawn characters working their way through a cracking script with a very mean heart. I say again: what more do you need to know? *** ¬Ω","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13WGM3PC13CDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040QYRTK#wasThisHelpful","R13WGM3PC13CDS","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jerry Bumpus, Special Offer (Carpenter Press, 1981)My last experience with Carpenter Press was Robert Fox's Destiny News, which landed solidly on the Worst I Read list for 2013 (at #12). So when I noticed that Jerry Bumpus' Special Offer was published by the same press, I approached it with some trepidation. I still cracked the cover; it's slim, it's short stories, and had it been as bad as Destiny News, I would have thrown it to the wolves after the fifty-page rule. Special Offer, however, is, in a phrase, everything that Destiny News is not.The book opens with the title story, and for the first two or three pages, I was wondering. Then, Bumpus lets loose, in his strange tale of a furniture store no one ever visits, and the travelers who decide to stop in. It's weird, but there's more than that, especially when you look at it in the light cast by Robert Fox's pale characters who do nothing; Bumpus' characters have sex (and not just sex, but weird sex), they don't talk in a monotone even when disagreeing, they eat and smoke and buy and sell and [censored for Amazon consumption] and spray one another with water (or, sometimes, acid) and in general act like real human beings. And Bumpus, in story after story, puts them in the weirdest imaginable situations.Ultimately, this is the book's biggest problem; while Bumpus published it some thirty years before the Bizarro movement became A Thing(TM), if Bumpus is not one of the movement's spiritual fathers, it's only because he's obscure enough that Bizarro's best writers just haven't heard of him yet. The downside is that, like much of Bizarro, Bumpus' stories often feel like there's no real anchor for all the weirdness; it just exists because Bumpus thought ‚Äúwhat if I put these characters in THIS stupid situation?‚Äù. A little of that tends to go a long way, and a couple of stories here go so far off the rails they might as well be set on other planets (‚ÄúThe Angel Business‚Äù stood out in this regard, as did ‚ÄúThe Fudgers‚Äù). Bumpus' stories work better when the realism he often clings to actually makes sense; the characters seem sharper, the situations more relatable. The anthropologist who narrates ‚ÄúWith the Mory Bot‚Äù is the kind of absurdly wonderful person you love sharing a beer with at the bar; the nutcase at the center of ‚ÄúPizeop‚Äù is hilarious and heartbreaking in equal measures.But if you're going to hunt a copy of this book down‚Äîand you should, even if it is far harder to do thirty-odd years later‚Äîyou're doing it for two of the stories here. ‚ÄúA Very Modern Home‚Äù is the closest thing to a traditional story you'll find here. It's a horror piece (many of these can be cast that way in the proper lighting), but it's a horror piece a la Shirley Jackson rather than A. Merritt. A real estate agent, recovering from a stroke and possibly developing Alzherimer's, finds herself in a position of having to show the house she was showing when the stroke hit her. The other, ‚ÄúMrs. Bell and Her Dog‚Äù, seems mostly normal‚Äîthe diction is a touch off‚Äîuntil you get about halfway through, and then Bumpus broadsides you with the book's only major twist. And it's perfect, and it turns the story into the kind of heartbreaker you knew he was capable of while you were reading the other ones.One other note: if you're not a fan of, shall we say, ambiguous endings, this book will drive you up a wall. Even if you are, a couple of the endings here may make you want to burn it. (The ending of the aforementioned ‚ÄúWith the Mory Bot‚Äù is probably the most gratuitous of these, but ‚ÄúMr. Spoon's Visit‚Äù runs a close second.) So while there are quite a few things here to recommend it to the discerning fan of weirdness, it's also a minefield. I found it worth traversing, but the individual reader will need to be the judge on this one. ***","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TEG811EBYJD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0914140086#wasThisHelpful","R3TEG811EBYJD6","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Damned by Dawn (Brett Anstey, 2009)Usually when I say ‚Äúthey weren't even trying‚Äù in a review, I'm talking about the worst thing about the movie/book/whatever in question. And when you've gotten to that level, there's usually not that much farther to descend. However, just as there's always at least one faster gunslinger out there, there's always one step below the worst thing you had ever thought you'd seen. When I say that Damned by Dawn's scriptwriter, director, and various assorted other connections weren't even trying to disguise the movie's status as a shameless ripoff of The Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn, I'm telling you the best thing about this movie. Yes, believe me (because unless you are a glutton for punishment you will never, ever want to watch this movie): it gets worse.If you've seen Evil Dead 2, the plot here will be very familiar to you. The only difference is the method of demon-infection, which here comes from a banshee (Bridget Neval in her big-screen debut). Other than that, it's pretty much identical‚Äîa bunch of young-and-beautifuls turn into demons and try to kill the final girl. You know, your usual weekend getaway.You sit there watching some movies, at least if you're me, and you keep asking yourself how in the world they got made. Damned by Dawn is one of those movies. At least it doesn't try to hide this; the DVD cover of the Australian version has the tagline ‚Äúsick of waiting for Evil Dead 4? Check out...‚Äù Nice to see that someone had a sense of humor about it, at least. I, on the other hand, didn't. Everything about this movie is awful.

"Howard Henkin, The Dot System (Dot Enterprises, Inc., 1980)[originally posted 4Nov2002]The Dot System has achieved almost legendary status among handicappers not for its content, but for its rarity and the stupid price it normally goes for when a copy is found on ebay. I finally managed to pick one up for what passes for dirt cheap in the business of rare vertical-market publications, and found that ‚Äústupid‚Äù applies to more than the price.As I mentioned in my review of Mr. Trifecta, there are handicapping tomes based on solid perceptions to be gleaned from the racing papers, and there are books that rely on more nebulous data. the Dot System takes a kind of middle-of-the-road approach; the basic idea here is to look at selections from a large number of handicappers and make your picks based on what they have to say. Don‚Äôt do any of the handicapping yourself; leave that to the so-called experts.To be fair, this method is not without its merits. I ‚Äúhandicap‚Äù harness horses that way on my rare trips to see the standardbreds (because I have no facility for trip handicapping, which is a necessity with the pacers and trotters), and it‚Äôll usually send me home a few dollars to the good.

"The Collection (Marcus Dunstan, 2012)I'm still not quite sure what led me to press play on Marcus Dunstan's The Collection. It's the sequel to his 2009 film The Collector, which I loathed. But since I watched it, I have read a number of reviews of it, and everyone else had the same reaction I did: ‚Äúwow, that first one was pretty awful, but The Collection shows Dunstan learned from his mistakes.‚Äù Well, maybe not in so many words, but the sentiment is there. I may be overplaying this; The Collection has a 37% rating at Rotten Tomatoes (critical), while The Collector has 30%. But hey, a seven-percent improvement is a step in the right direction, no? While ultimately The Collection is yet another serial killer movie, after the first few minutes Dunstan abandons all attempts at realism and turns this into the movie Saw II kind of wanted to be out of the corner of its eye (and I say this as an unabashed fan of Saw II, the last entry in that franchise I liked); you throw a bunch of people in a craaaaaaaaaaaaaaazy house with a demented killer and see what happens. Nothing that happens is new or original, but it's pretty fun.NOTE: The following plot synopsis necessarily contains spoilers for the previous film. If you have not seen The Collector and are planning to, you'll want to skip the next paragraph.When we last saw the Collector (24's Randall Archer), he was, of course, getting away scot-free. Otherwise, this would be a very short film. We open in a dance club with loud music and lasers and all sorts of chaos‚Äîso when a series of traps starts taking out the guests, very few people initially notice. Elena (The Social Network's Emma Fitzpatrick) is at the club, but has no idea what's going on out there; she spotted her boyfriend with another girl, stormed off into a random room, and found a big chest. When she opened it, she discovered the battered body of Arkin (The Dark Knight Rises' Josh Stewart), the Collector's‚Äîsupposedly‚Äîfinal victim in the previous film. The two of them escape, through some rather unbelievable stunts, the massacre out in the main room. Well, ‚Äúescape‚Äù may be pushing it a little, since while Arkin gets away by jumping out a window, Elena is grabbed by the Collector and spirited off to his place. The cops are more than willing to pin everything on Arkin, effectively blackmailing him, as the only surviving victim of the Collector, to take them through the house searching for Elena. Needless to say, while Arkin knows some of the Collector's tricks, he doesn't know all of them...Yeah, well, it's a ‚Äúput a bunch of people in a trapped house and sit back and watch the fun‚Äù movie. You know what? If you played Dungeons and Dragons as a kid and the infamous, utterly sadistic Tomb of Horrors tournament module was one of your favorites, you will get a lot of kicks out of this movie. (Unfortunately, no one thought to stuff a Sphere of Annihilation into a gargoyle's mouth here.) No, there's not a great deal of plot, but the horrors Arkin and his forcible cohorts discover are varied and far more imaginative than anything you saw in the first film; Dunstan learned from his mistakes, and did so relatively quickly. That's a rarity in Hollywood, and nowhere more so than in genre horror. Turn your brain off, sit back with a bucket of popcorn, and enjoy. ** ¬Ω","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXG24YJY8SF92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZTUUQK#wasThisHelpful","RXG24YJY8SF92","A2EDZH51XHFA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EDZH51XHFA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At first, I wasn‚‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sure I would enjoy this book. It seemed too pat, too packaged, too markety.

And the truth is, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m NOT the target market: this book is written for young women. However, I have a bevy of young women in my life: daughters and nieces and friends. Though this book is a perfect read for them √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d say from about 8th grade and older √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s also a book that moms and aunts and mentors can and should read.The book takes an in-depth look at three major Disney princesses: Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. From each of those, Terraccino draws out faith lessons that left me nodding. The connections she draws from these stories are creative and clever and applicable.There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a message in this book that every young woman needs: there is hope for being a princess! Your standards don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to be lowered and God does have a plan for your life. This is a book, above all, about the hope of authentic faith and femininity.Overall, an enjoyable read.

"John Paul II was such a giant of a man to many of us that it‚Äôs hard to picture him as a little boy, vulnerable and scared. However, that‚Äôs just how this book starts, and the humanity behind the great scholar and saint is revealed in the rather whimsical illustrations and the very down-to-earth writing.As I read this out loud to my four-year-old, I found myself getting a little choked up more than once. I was struck by how very tangible this modern saint‚Äôs life was, by how approachable ‚ÄúLolek‚Äù was. No longer was he the amazing man I had read repeatedly and admired, but suddenly a boy not much bigger than the one beside me. No longer was he the stunning intellectual, but rather a young man doing what he knew to be right. No longer was he a distant figure, comfortable in heaven, but instead a man who had struggled and suffered immensely.This book touches the heart of readers, young and old. In its simplicity of story, it parses the complications that we so often face when we look at the lives of great saints.

Younger children will be interested in the activity and adventures Benedict faced.Adults who find themselves in the middle, reading this out loud, may find themselves struck by how busy a man could be in the days before electricity.This is a book for the whole family, I think, and one that will last the years and be worth revisiting later, as the younger kids get older.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C35XP1ZIA823/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586179853#wasThisHelpful","R3C35XP1ZIA823","A1Y7M7Q37TSDJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y7M7Q37TSDJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The story deserves more than mention, but I want to just bring up the illustrations for a minute, because I have seen how they can engage my kids (and myself too!) in books that are truly well-done. And this is one such book.Cousins Lorenzo and Gianna are grumpy and stuck with an old uncle, who happens to be a Franciscan brother. He turns a walk through Assisi into an adventure where they learn about Saint Francis.We‚Äôre a map-loving family, and the fact that the inside of the book has a map of the walk through Assisi only adds to the appeal. Sprinkled throughout are quotes from Saint Francis ‚Äî not as part of the story, but as supplements.The journey through Assisi isn‚Äôt just beautiful, it‚Äôs also a bit of a guessing game. Brother Antonio, the uncle who serves as guide, engages both his two young companions and those of us reading along by always asking for input before sharing the story.

"Yes, it's true. A well-known, highly published, and hugely popular Catholic priest is encouraging all of us to spend Lent with the devil. And I can tell you, having had a taste of the journey, that it's one that will be well-worth the effort.Fr. Dwight Longenecker, whose wisdom graces the webpages of many well-esteemed Catholic sites (including his own very popular blog, Standing on My Head), has released a new book that is designed to take you on a journey through Lent with none other than the devil himself.Slubgrip Instructs: Fifty Days with the Devil, while a sequel to Longenecker's Gargoyle Code, stands alone and does the ""make you think twice about everything in your life"" job quite nicely.It's a fast read if you sit down to read it, but I would encourage you to take your copy (because, I assure you, you need one!) and savor it.

And while this book helps us do that, it does it by using storytelling as craft. You won't be able to put it down, and once you finish, you'll wish there was more. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10EOYVA5996SU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0F9MUC#wasThisHelpful","R10EOYVA5996SU","A1Y7M7Q37TSDJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y7M7Q37TSDJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was hugely leery of the price of this, and since I reviewed it for Amazon Vine, I didn't have to pay for it.That said, my mother-in-law was over when I took it out of the box, and she was beside herself about it. Even when I told her the price, she didn't care.This is made so sturdily, and it has a dual purpose ability:  you can close up the little drain thing and use it just as a rack, or you can use it to dry your dishes (which is why I was interested in it). It folds up, but without being flimsy about it.It's bigger than my standard dish drying rack was, and the dishes sort of sit down in it while they drain, so I'm going to have to wipe it out regularly. That said, did I mention it's sturdy? This is well made in a way I don't know that I've seen in a dish rack.The gray triangle plate rack thing folds down flat, if you want to use it that way, and there are legs on the back that can prop it up so it drains out (and if you snap them off, as I accidentally did, they go right back on and stay on without breaking!).I'm highly impressed. I suspect my mother-in-law's going to be getting one of these soon as a gift.

"No one was more surprised than I was when Jeff Young wrote and asked me if I would endorse his new book, Around the Table with the Catholic Foodie: Middle Eastern Cuisine. Of all the people who know me, Jeff knows that I‚Äôm, uh, NOT a foodie. At. All.But I like to eat. (So when I have the chance to have Jeff cook for me, I‚Äôm ALL OVER IT.)Confession: I haven‚Äôt read the entire book. But I have drooled all over it, and I‚Äôm going to be trying more than a few of the recipes in it.But wait, it‚Äôs not just a cookbook. Far from it. This is a book that also journeys through the Holy Land: that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs focused on Middle Eastern cuisine!I cook because I have to, and Young‚Äôs book (and his Catholic Foodie apostolate) is an inspiration to me to try to make more of it. His goal? To get families around the table for dinner. And one of the ways to do that is to inspire great foods from them.This is a book that‚Äôs designed for all of us‚Ä¶and that makes it even more special than it would otherwise be, I think.

"Jennifer Grant, in her new release Wholehearted Living: Five-Minute Reflections for Modern Moms, begins by outlining a few things that get my momsense stirring and my momtuition raving...in a good way.She calls the book ""a 'pause' button for mothers who want to take a break from talk of juice boxes and snow pants in favor of confronting their fears or reconnecting with their dreams.""The book delivers what it promises. I'll admit I didn't have the time to read all 365 of the daily reflections, but I did sample through them enough to know this is the kind of book that:1. Most moms need to read and dip into and out of.2. Will be a great gift for quite a few of the moms I know.3. Won't go out of style anytime soon.The book divides the year into three parts: Reflect, Risk, and Rest. You begin in January with reflection, and then, as May begins, you start to look at risk, and you end the year, just as school starts up in September, with rest.It's a pattern that spoke to my life, to the way the ebbs and flows of my own experience of momness.While Grant references talk that makes me think of moms with younger children, I don't necessarily think this book is limited to the scope of young moms or moms with young families. That's the place she's writing from, and it's a place many moms have been and/or are. It's a hard place, a crucible unlike any other.The reflections aren't long; their brevity is almost unparalleled in a book of this sort. And yet, as Grant herself notes, ""a good five minutes actually makes a difference, affecting how we relate with others and how we perceive our lives for the rest of the day.""Opening and using this book ‚Äî whether you dip into it or swim around for a while ‚Äî won't leave you with something else to do. Grant has explicitly avoided doing more than giving you a reason to sit and reflect with her for five minutes. She's planting a seed in those five (or less) minutes, one that may just sprout into more throughout your day.Though this book has many Catholic undertones, it's not explicitly Catholic in the way that many books I endorse and read are. You could as easily give this to any Christian friend (practicing or not), and she would appreciate the quote or scripture that opens each day, the short reflection, and the one or two reflection questions that close each day.This truly is a book, as Grant says in the introduction, ""for moments when you feel drawn toward the divine, as well as for those times when you feel like your frailties are holding you captive and you really just want to stand in the corner, face the wall, and scream.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DXX2UVMR4XRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0829440542#wasThisHelpful","R3DXX2UVMR4XRD","A1Y7M7Q37TSDJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y7M7Q37TSDJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Trusting God is easier said that done, at least for me. I always seem to think I know better. Or that I can do it myself, which puts me at about the same level as my three-year-old.Over the years, I‚Äôve become quite a St. Therese fangirl, though I will admit that I struggle sometimes. Her Little Way doesn‚Äôt seem little in terms of effort or difficulty. Her philosophy trumps me. And yet I keep coming back to her.So I was intrigued by Connie Rossini‚Äôs new book Trusting God with St. Therese (Four Waters Press). Rossini seems to be a highly practical person, so I didn‚Äôt expect a lot of flowery advice that I won‚Äôt be able to follow anyway.Rossini manages to make St. Therese, the great Doctor of the Church, into someone accessible, and she does it in part by sharing her own story in conjunction with Therese‚Äôs. Suddenly the Little Flower becomes not just a saint who either bordered on whiny or who was so perfect I stand no chance of being inspired, but someone who I can turn to in prayer and maybe even hear speaking to me as I read about her.At the end of each of the 13 chapters, there are reflection questions that would be ideal if you were using the book for a study group or even for journaling inspiration. Rossini has also included at least two, and sometimes as many as four, practical suggestions at the end of each chapter, too.Reading about Rossini‚Äôs experiences through the lens of St. Therese was inspiring, true. Beyond that, though, it also motivated me to consider how my own experiences can be viewed in light of the saints who impact and inspire me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32QHFCKZ80JSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692248528#wasThisHelpful","R32QHFCKZ80JSW","A1Y7M7Q37TSDJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y7M7Q37TSDJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How many times, asks the back cover of The Quick Reference Guide to the Catholic Bible, have you wanted some context and background about a book of the Bible but didn't have the time to wade through a long commentary?Well, I answer, plenty. Isn't that why we have the internet?Oh lo, the internet and the imperfections of searching for scriptural help online. It's a crapshoot at best and a dangerous game of roulette at worst.I didn't have time to give this book a complete and thorough reading; instead, I did a little dipping into it with a few of my favorite books of the Bible, starting with Ruth.Just as the back cover promised, there's a summary of the book, including a little bit about why in the world Ruth is even important in the context of scripture. There's also an At a Glance section that answers Who, What, When, Where, and Why in a sentence or two. Then comes a section on the structure of the book, a listing of the major themes found within it, authorship, and the literary form. There's also a part about key passages and the chapter on Ruth wraps up with food for thought.This is all well and good, and if you're like me, you've already thought of three people who need this as a gift. However, let me say this, and say it loudly: this book is written for the rest of us: the rest of us who are reluctant catechists, the rest of us who are parents seeking answers to hard questions, the rest of us who like the idea but not so much the practice of studying the bible.I'm glad I didn't try to read this book cover to cover, because I suspect I would have done it a disservice. This isn't a cover-to-cover read: it's a reference that will, I hope, encourage more than just me to snuggle up with my big ole bible and crack that cover. It's just enough reference to get me interested in reading the source material. I call that a success.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRHK4X6I5B3WR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593252587#wasThisHelpful","RRHK4X6I5B3WR","A1Y7M7Q37TSDJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y7M7Q37TSDJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What The American Catholic Almanac does is brilliant. One page per day for one person.None of the people highlighted are stuffy or boring. Most of them are either (a) people I hadn't heard of or (b) people I didn't know were so stinkin' interesting. Even with the people who are so well-known as to be patrons of my kids, I learned interesting facts that made them more human.And the history I've gotten out of this book! I can only compare it to when I read The Frontiersman many years ago at my husband's behest.I've never been much of a fan of history. It was nothing but boring in high school, so I skipped it in college.In the last 15 years or so, I've learned more from great stories than I ever learned in high school history, and I think The American Catholic Almanac would be well placed in a history classroom.I had NO IDEA the work and hardship that early American Catholics had to work through and put up with! I had NO IDEA what kind of investment mission priests and religious made in the United States! I had NO IDEA how many inter-stinkin-esting people there were in the annals of American Catholic history!Thanks to The American Catholic Almanac, I've had a taste. (In the interest of full disclosure, I'm not all the way through the book. Though I will be soon.)This isn't a book for the bookshelf. It is, however, a book to share and reread and quote.

"This is a daily flip calendar that can be used perennially. Each day has two entries: a Bible verse for your morning, with a little one or two sentence injunction from Fr. Larry Richards.I have a love-hate relationship with desk calendars. I love the idea of them, but I tend to not be consistent with them these days, in part because I do my work at my desk and at the table, on the couch, in the kitchen, at the library, at a friend's...you see how it is.But I love the idea of taking a little bit of scripture before breakfast and before bed. Says Fr. Larry in the introduction,""This perpetual calendar will help you begin and end each day with an encounter with Jesus Christ in His Word. I encourage you to pray to the Holy Spirit before you read the verse every morning and every night, so that it is God Himself who reveals His Word to you.""Let's take a look at September 26 to get a sense of it. The calendar tells me that it's the feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian.""Much will be required of the person entrusted with much."" (Luke 12:48)We all have been given much‚ÄîJesus Christ‚Äîso much is expected from us!~ ~ ~I will be glad and exult in you; / I will sing praise to your name, O Most High. (Psalm 9:2, ESV)Let tonight be about praising God, not us. Pax.By my calculations, this calendar is asking for about two minutes of my morning and two minutes before bed. It's so simple that I can't help but think it's brilliant: many of my devotional failures are because I try to overcomplicate things.This isn't complicated. It's not hard. But it is an invitation to something very important.And if I fail...well, there's always the next day.

"You don‚Äôt have to turn far to see a discussion of same sex attraction. It‚Äôs everywhere, and it‚Äôs heated wherever you turn. People who seem to be otherwise calm and orderly suddenly sprout extra appendages and the ability to use words you‚Äôve never heard.So I was interested to see a small publisher release a book early this summer tackling this topic. In 200 pages, The Lion‚Äôs Heart, by Dena Hunt, combined masterful storytelling with uncomfortable topic matter.The story: Paul‚Äôs a gay guy, and it turns out that so is Max, though he doesn‚Äôt know it until he meets Paul. Wrench: Max is happily married. Another wrench: Paul is friends with the family.Don‚Äôt roll your eyes yet, because I‚Äôve not only oversimplified, I‚Äôve also left out the excellent writing. This could be a terrible story (all the elements are there), but it‚Äôs truly one that was crafted. The reader isn‚Äôt just carried along, but has to do some thinking and concluding.The premise of the book is the love affair between two men, but it‚Äôs about more than just what I think we‚Äôve all come to expect. Instead of focusing exclusively on what‚Äôs wrong with these two men, Hunt explores the impact their adultery‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs what it is‚Äîhas on their families and the people around them. She takes a theory that many of us have heard‚Äîthat what we do matters to more than just ourselves‚Äîand weaves it into a reality that‚Äôs hard to deny.This book grapples a topic that‚Äôs not only hot but that gets people hot. You‚Äôre probably not going to let your teen read it, but you should. This is an honest, candid, painful look at the humanity behind the terms that are tossed around. These characters are people, not numbers. They have depth and believability. They have problems that most of us are only spitting distance from having ourselves.Hunt does what few authors are able to do, and even less do well, she leaves well enough alone and she leaves the reader alone to make some important decisions and conclusions.This book is one of the most honest books I‚Äôve read, and that‚Äôs what makes it one that I‚Äôll share. It‚Äôs not pretty, it‚Äôs not easy, and it‚Äôs not lying. There‚Äôs no shying away from the pain for any of the characters, but there‚Äôs also a glimpse at what the beauty of love can really yield.

"I have been meaning to read this book for...well, I think it's been almost a year. And last week, I did. It's a quick read (I read it in about a day, without really rushing myself), and it's not bad overall. I tend not to read romances, but this is as much about relationships, with a bit of a mystery-ish thrown in. It reminded me, in good ways, of when I was in high school and picked up Nicholas Sparks's The Notebook. I half wished I'd been sitting on a beach when I read it, because it strikes me as a definite summer read.

So if this book hadn't landed in a pile I was committed to reading, I probably would have skipped it.And if I had done that, I would have missed out.Bishop Paprocki could probably write about just about anything and I would be following along enthusiastically, but I wouldn't have known that if I hadn't read this book. Paprocki writes in a down-to-earth, man-on-the-ice way, and he ties it in in a way that's decidedly not preachy.

"Can you say ""new favorite book for a Catholic you know""? Because that's my short review of this gem. If I was still teaching 5th grade religion classes, I would probably be petitioning to have copies of this for all my students.

"Now that my oldest, who's nine and in the third grade, is an avid reader, I'm always on the lookout for ways to introduce her to Bible stories, again and again. So when the Adventure Bible Handbook, by Robin Schmitt & David Frees (Zondervan, 2013) came my way, I was thrilled.I was even more thrilled by the way my nine-year-old took off with it and carried it around with her. Dare I hope that this might rate up there with the Magic Treehouse books?There are a few things I really, really liked about this book.It's pretty. The illustrations are reminiscent of what's in all the graphic novels that my daughter loves and the text is informative without being borrrrrring. You'll find beautiful maps in addition to the cartoonish stuff, photographs of Bible places, and paintings/illustrations that depict other aspects of Biblical life.The pages are full-color semi-gloss and it's a hardbound book. While that makes the price higher, it also makes it a book that will last. And that's a priority for me, because I want my other kids to enjoy it too.This is a way of making the Bible fun. The Word of God is the most important text we have, right? But...it's not always the easiest or most accessible text. That makes a book like this something I'm glad to have sitting around. Though I don't find the graphic novel stuff the easiest to narrate aloud to my younger kids, the many sidebars and extra stuff give it layersDid I mention there's not just one index, but three (and possibly four, depending on how you categorize things)?

Or...something altogether different?Turns out, the answer is yes.This is a book of lessons, yes, but it's also a book of insight. So much has been said about Pope Francis. The man can't say a sentence without people jumping in to interpret and explain.Lowney takes a different approach. He has Jesuit training and shares some important background with Pope Francis, so he uses that as the lens through which he considers what we can all learn from Pope Francis.It's hard to believe, really, that this is based off of a year. In some ways, that's the beauty of it.It's not overwritten or stretched out: this is a book that's tightly written and well-researched. It reads like a book off the NYT bestseller list, minus the snark and cynicism.I found myself appreciating Jesuit spirituality more, because Lowney explains it.

"It's been some time since the Mars-bound spaceship carrying Chief Engineer Henry Starrett vanished. In the book before this one, ""A Doorway Through Space,"" Henry's wife - Captain Ellen Starrett - headed out in her ship hoping to find out what happened, only to vanish at the same coordinates. Their children, Donald and Lucy (from whose viewpoint most of the scenes are written), teamed up with a family friend and renowned but offbeat scientist to follow both Henry and Ellen in the belief that rescue was still possible. With their vessel destroyed, the trio wound up on board a one-man warship captained by a young military pilot named Scott, who as this second book opens has become Donald's best friend and Lucy's suitor. Yes, she's still in high school; but Scott is still a teenager himself, and the two find each other enthralling.Ellen Starrett and her crew were rescued from the alien planet where they'd been imprisoned and marked for execution. Rescued and rescuers returned to Earth in triumph, and all was well. But now, Ellen and Dr. Hartwick - the family friend whose scientific genius made the previous books' events possible - are working on a time machine. It's summer, and with Donald off on his own Ellen and Lucy find themselves saddled with Lucy's cousins, mischievous twins Romi and Remi. The site of the time machine project is in Italy, near Rome. Hear any echoes yet?Judith Bourassa Joy understood that if you show a gun in the first scene, it had better go off as the story progresses. Yes, there's meaning in those names.

"Three teenaged boys do what teenagers have always done, one night on a lake in northern Minnesota. They paddle their kayaks to a place that legend says is evil and dangerous, Windigo Island, so one 13-year-old can carry out his vow to spray paint a love message onto a rock that can be seen with binoculars from the lake's shore. Before they can leave, a tremendous wind comes up out of nowhere; and while his friends flee in terror, the boy wielding the spray paint breaks his ankle and finds himself trapped. He's sure he hears the Windigo - a flesh-eating monster of Ojibwe myth - call his name, and he's also sure he sees another monster, Michi Peshu, coming toward him out of the lake. What actually washes up on the shore, to be found by the rescue squad that retrieves him, is the corpse of a long missing teenaged girl.That girl vanished a year ago, in company with a friend who is related to former Tamarack County sheriff Cork O'Connor. Cork, who is one-quarter Ojibwe and very much committed to that heritage, now works as a private investigator and maintains a home for his daughter, Jenny, and her adopted 3-year-old son. He's still reeling from an attack by a vengeful stalker who put a paralyzing bullet into his 17-year-old son. Stephen is recuperating at a physical therapy clinic, where he's just learning to walk again. The last thing Cork needs right now is a client who can't pay him; but family is family, and he hates what he knows probably happened to the missing girl, Mariah Arceneaux. Jenny, who's in her late 20s now and working on a novel when she isn't managing the O'Connor family's summertime burger stand, comes along when Cork hears the story at the remote cabin of his long time mentor, an elderly Ojibwe healer called Henry. Jenny is so moved by Mariah's likely plight that she insists on joining her father when Cork heads for the Bad Bluff Reservation to see what he can do for Mariah's mother.What follows is a tale that explores the consequences of Ojibwe and other Native American tribes having their cultures shattered, and their lives defined by white men's values. It's a world within a world, where women expect to be used and where having a future means playing by someone else's rules. Henry's enigmatic response to Mariah's mother, a one-legged diabetic who hardly dares to hope for her daughter's safe return, puzzles both O'Connors and infuriates Jenny. We see parts of the story through her eyes, and I found it interesting to view Cork from Jenny's perspective. One of the best aspects of this novel, for me, was Jenny coming into her own and working beside her father - even when Cork did his best to prevent her from doing so.This is the sort of book that I can't put down in order to go to sleep. I started it in the evening, the more fool me; and I finished it at almost 2 a.m. In other words, an absorbing tale indeed!--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Three young people gather in a southern Sweden nature reserve, a place where they can expect privacy at night, to celebrate Midsummer's Eve in costume. A fourth expected to join them, but can't due to sudden illness. For no reason that the reader can tell at that time, a man shoots all three to death and buries their bodies inside the reserve. As far as their parents and the rest of the world are concerned, the trio has vanished; but one mother insists that the post cards she subsequently receives from various cities in Europe, purporting to be from her daughter, are forgeries.Six weeks later, Ystad Detective Inspector Kurt Wallander wakes from his sleep certain that his colleague Svedberg's uncharacteristic absence from work on the preceding day - and failure to answer his telephone, or otherwise check in - means something is horribly wrong. When he goes to Svedberg's flat and gains entry, he discovers the man dead by shotgun blast and the flat obviously searched. Almost at the same time, a couple visiting the nature reserve discovers the six-weeks decayed corpses of the missing young people. Where were they during the time they were missing? Who sent the forged post cards, and why would their killer conceal their bodies (not to mention where) and then present them to be found?Wallander is reeling from his father's recent death, and he's also alternately denying and trying to cope with a diabetes diagnosis. The Ystad homicide squad's members find it difficult to investigate Svedberg's murder, and it's especially so for Wallander. No one imagines the murders of the young people in the nature reserve may be connected to Svedberg's killing. No one except Wallander, whose natural intuition has been finely honed by his decades of work; and who cares so much that he just may kill himself while getting the job done.This is gritty reading indeed, but I found it fascinating. Wallander's character, and that of the killer, are both gradually revealed through their behavior - we're shown, not told, what makes both tick. As usual with Mankell, Swedish culture in its then current state is more character than background. A fine installment in a series that continues to hold my interest.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Swedish detective inspector Kurt Wallander agrees to check on the odd situation because everyone else in his small town's police department is busy, and the elderly farmer who called in the report seems to need attention. There's a teenaged girl sitting in the farmer's rape field. She's been there ever since the farmer first looked into his field, at 5 a.m.; and when the old man tried approaching her, she fled to another part of the field. It doesn't look like much of an emergency to Wallander. Not until he approaches the girl himself, intending to ask her business and persuade her to vacate the farmer's property - because that's when she douses herself with petrol and strikes a cigarette lighter into flame.That horrifying scene was the first Wallander tale I encountered, in the PBS adaptation of this book. I've waited a few years before giving the novels a try, and now I've reached this fifth installment in the series. As should be the case with good fiction adapted for film or television, the books have more depth and tell a more complex, more nuanced story; but I now know that the scriptwriter did an excellent job. The Wallander books, this one included, tend to have many plot threads that ultimately come together. They can be - not difficult to follow, but perhaps challenging is a better word? Because I enjoy the complexity; it doesn't frustrate me. Wallander is an intriguing character, a reluctant hero who has done his best to break free from his increasingly unpleasant police career but who repeatedly discovers that he's doing the one thing with his life at which he truly excels. And at which his talents are desperately needed, too.One of the best installments I've read so far in a highly enjoyable series.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"On a rural road outside the small Swedish city where Chief Inspector Kurt Wallander works as a police detective, an estate agent tries to locate an unoccupied house and winds up stopping for directions at another house that is supposed to be vacant but isn't. The man whom she asks kills her with a single shot to the head. It takes time for the Ystad police to locate her body, and during that time the killer and those with him in the house have disappeared. The one clue left behind: a black man's severed finger.That's the beginning of a tale which shifts back and forth between Sweden and South Africa, a case that drives Kurt Wallander to the edge and then over it. Set in the time between Nelson Mandela's release from Robben Island and Mandela's becoming South Africa's first black president, it's a taut suspense yarn in which Wallander isn't present for at least half of the time; but in this case that's fine, because without hearing the South African characters' stories the action in Sweden would make no sense. Wallander faces his greatest fear, that his work may place the one person he loves most - his adult daughter, Linda - in peril. Will he have to face his work causing her death? And will Wallander himself survive, psychologically as well as physically?Mankell never leaves threads hanging, and I appreciate that. This book's ending leads naturally into the next volume in the series, but it does have an ending; and everything works despite the many shifts in viewpoint. My one question is whether or not the story works as well for a reader who doesn't remember the time about which Mankell is writing. I hope it does, because I enjoyed it thoroughly.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Patrolman Kurt Wallander is 23 years old, and he longs to leave the beat behind and join the Homicide Division as a detective. The first story in this anthology of five tales introduces him to the woman he will marry, and launches him on the career that already amounts to an obsession. The man he's becoming is already there, and that man develops through the subsequent stories until in the final one - the title piece of this volume, THE PYRAMID - he's familar to readers of the series, and to viewers of the PBS adaptation. We see him as a young father, as a bewildered husband on the verge of his marriage's breakup, and as his artist father's put-upon son. THE PYRAMID leads directly into the opening of the first novel in the series, FACELESS KILLERS.I'm sure most readers began long ago with the series itself, and that I'm unusual in having started with this book even though the author states it was put together last. My local library has it marked as Book One, and that's why I began with it when I decided to give Mankell a try. I'm now deep into FACELESS KILLERS. The first story didn't hook me, really; but the others did. Mankell's writing is very light on dialog, and he does a great deal of telling rather than showing; but somehow he makes it work despite ignoring those two supposed cardinal rules for the novelist. Wallander is a haunting figure, and my only dissatisfaction is that from time to time I get the feeling I'm hearing Mankell's political and social views as words put into the mouths of his characters. That jolts me when it happens, but it's by no means distracting enough to spoil the read overall.Looks as if I'll be reading the whole series!--Reviewed by Nina M.

"In 1650, the Spanish colonial city of Potosi sits above the treeline - so high in the South American mountains that European babies can't survive their first months of life in its thin, cold air. A woman who wants her child to live goes lower to deliver, and stays there until the baby is a year old. Potosi is a large and very busy city, in spite of its harsh location, because it's founded on the silver mines that are its only real industry. Now, though, the mines are starting to run out. The city's most powerful men, the mine owners, do not want this known. What has that to do with the mysterious death of a 15-year-old girl? Inez de la Morada died alone in her cell at the convent of Santa Isabella de los Santos Milagros, and because she locked herself inside the powers that be want to rule her passing a suicide. That will serve admirably the Inquisition's desire to declare Mother Abbess Maria Santa Hilda a heretic. They've been watching for such an opportunity, because Maria Santa Hilda makes no secret of her unconventional views on women's abilities in this society where a secular woman's only task is to produce children for the man she marries. Inez took refuge in the convent to escape her father's wrath; and so did the daughter of her father's bitter enemy, who came there to stop her own father from marrying her to a man he has chosen and young Beatriz doesn't even know.That's the setup for a debut novel that I found it hard to see as such. Alfieri writes with assurance, her setting rendered meticulously and her characters beautifully developed. It's a mystery, yes.

"Emily Allen began having the nightmares on Halloween, when she was 16 years old. She woke up screaming in terror, because the burning of a building with a six-sided cupola on top (surely it must be a church?) seemed completely real. It's years later now, and Emily is a former advertising agency employee who has quit her job for good reason and moved from Portland, Maine to the small town of Farley Bend. She's rented one of the first apartments to be renovated from the town's old, long abandoned mill, because the minute she drove into its parking lot the building felt to her like home. When she experiences the familiar nightmare on her first night in residence there, she's disappointed; she hoped that changing her life so drastically might stop the dreams permanently, instead of giving them a hiatus. But Farley Bend still seems like home, and Emily is determined to make it so. She isn't expecting what happens when she begins to research the old mill's history. That's when she learns that the fire in her dreams was a real one, and the building with the six-sided cupola isn't a church. It's the mill, as it was before fire destroyed all but the watchman's house where her landlady now lives and the structure that now houses her apartment.First-time novelist Lugner weaves an intriguing and sometimes eerie tale that mixes paranormal elements with mystery, enlivened by just the right amount of romance. Wisely, she refrains from trying to explain everything her characters experience. Instead she lets Emily and the people of Farley Bend, past as well as present, take her and her readers along on a nicely paced adventure. I found it a quick and thoroughly enjoyable read.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Chris Bohjalian began his career as a mystery writer, and has since found considerable success as a mainstream novelist. Those are meaty, thought-provoking books, rich in sense of place and characterization. This collection of his weekly newspaper columns (plus a few other things) is quite different, and yet hauntingly similar. I recognized the source material his Armenian grandparents provided for THE SANDCASTLE GIRLS, for example; but this book possesses a much lighter tone than the novels.

"Victorian scientist Dudley Kynaston's household is short one ladies' maid on a morning when 13-year-old scullery maid Maisie goes outside at 5:45 a.m., performing her usual early morning chores, and discovers blood and clumps of hair on the back steps. There's no dead body, but the hair - torn out by the roots - looks like that of the missing ladies' maid, Kitty. Only because of Kynaston's importance to the government (he is a researcher into the possibilities presented by submarines) is this anything but an ordinary case for the police. But Kynaston is exactly that important, so Special Branch Commander Thomas Pitt must investigate.Pitt came to Special Branch from the regular London police, and he's still the best detective many people know. More often than not, the cases he investigates now are top secret and can't be discussed with Charlotte, his well-born wife; but this one he does talk about with her, and Charlotte sees an opportunity to involve her bored and unhappy sister, Emily Radley. Emily is the widow of a titled, wealthy aristocrat, and the current wife of a member of Parliament. She has access to the Kynastons' social class; and through her, so does Charlotte. As they did many times before, when Pitt was a police detective, the two women make their own inquiries. They learn a lot about the Kynastons' marriage, and some especially interesting things about Ailsa Kynaston, widow of Dudley Kynaston's beloved brother.I love Anne Perry's work. I had grown a bit tired of the Pitt series, though, because the saga of Thomas being forced out of his police superintendency and into Special Branch was just too rife with conspiracy theory for my taste. The book before this one promised things might get back on track; and this book really delivers in that respect. Victor Narraway, former holder of Commander Pitt's current position, has become an interesting character now that he's more illuminated and less mysterious, and the Pitts are once again behaving as they used to behave. The story resolves in a clear and believable manner, and Perry once again does what she's best at: she gives all of her characters multiple dimensions. The ""villains"" aren't entirely evil, and the ""heroes"" aren't entirely good.This one's a keeper!--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Brian and Marcia Middleton sell their New York City apartment and purchase an old house in the hamlet of Deering, Vermont, to make a new start after Brian confesses to an affair and Marcia decides to forgive instead of leaving him. The locals make them welcome; but something about the house isn't right, and Marcia knows it on her first day there alone. After a well-meaning neighbor tells them the house's story during a Saturday night visit, Marcia awakens early Monday morning to find her husband missing from their bed...because he's hanged himself in the attic.Burlington detective J.P. Burrows grew up in another Vermont hamlet like Deering. The 30-something bachelor is initially unhappy about being assigned to investigate Brian Middleton's obvious (or so it seems) suicide, because he's forced to abandon another on-going investigation; but soon he finds himself not just interested, but positively obsessed. Not only does he learn intriguing bits of information from his retarded brother, who has worked in the house as helper for a renovation company and who briefly knew the victim; he also becomes powerfully attracted to the newly widowed and increasingly terrified Marcia Middleton.This is part ghost story, part mystery/suspense novel, and it's top drawer despite being its author's second published book.

"In 1981 Vermont, 34-year-old midwife Sybil Danforth finds herself trapped by an ice storm at the home of a patient who needs to be transferred to a hospital. Sybil has never hesitated to take that step when it's been warranted, and the physician who acts as her backup has complete trust in her judgment after years of seeing her decisions proved sound. This time, though, the weather and inoperative phone lines conspire to keep Sybil's patient from getting to the hospital in time to save her life. So the midwife, who has no surgical training - she's never even seen a C-section performed - asks her assistant and the baby's father to bring her the sharpest knife in the house. Meanwhile, she verifies that the mother no longer has a heartbeat or respiration. The woman has died, and the only hope for her baby is to get it out as quickly as possible.That's what Sybil does. But just hours later, after the improving weather allows her to get both patients - deceased mother and living infant - to the hospital, her young and inexperienced assistant telephones the backup physician and unburdens herself: she thinks the mother may have been alive when Sybil cut her open. Soon the State Police are at the Danforth home, and Sybil finds herself charged with manslaughter that could be elevated to second degree murder.The story is narrated by Connie, Sybil's 14-year-old only child, who has since become an obstetrician. It's a tense tale, authentic to its rural setting and to the times when former hippies like the Danforths were raising their families and finding ways to apply their 60s values in a 1980s world. Part of the story is about Connie's maturing toward womanhood, and part of it is about Sybil. Is it about midwifery as a life's work? (I can't say ""as a profession,"" since Sybil is unlicensed and apprenticeship trained.) To some extent, yes. But mostly, it's about how people with non-mainstream values perceive themselves and how the larger culture perceives and treats them.If gray areas make you uncomfortable, this isn't likely to be the book for you.

"Journalism professor, master's degree candidate, military wife for 13 years, mother of three young boys. Newspaper columnist Sarah Smiley has her hands full during the year of husband Dustin's deployment, and that's an understatement for sure. Navy Lieutenant Commander Smiley is stationed at the Bangor, Maine Naval Recruiting Center, so for the first time in her married life Sarah has no base with other military families to understand what her life is like and provide empathy as well as support. Actually, make that for the first time in her life, really; for Sarah is a former military ""brat"" as well as a Navy wife.Being the only adult in the house means never fully relaxing, even into sleep. ""How do you do it all?"" is a question Sarah answers, to herself at least, with another question: ""How can I NOT do it all?"" For there's no one else. She struggles with small things her husband always took care of before, like knowing when to tip and how much; but it's the big things, like having the sewer back up and flood the basement, that send her off the rails. Still, even from thousands of miles away in Africa, Dustin manages to give her a surprising amount of support. One thing he does even before leaving is encourage a random idea for helping his family pass the time constructively: Why not invite someone to fill his empty chair at the dinner table, one night a week? Someone interesting, who may be famous and important; or who may be important only to the Smileys, such as an elderly neighbor or youngest son Lindell's preschool teacher. They start with Senator Susan Collins, and before the year ends and Dustin comes home they've also entertained three former governors and a congressman. Not to mention a long list of others, some chosen for what they can teach the Smiley youngsters; and some for what the Smileys can give to them.This is an honest book. Achingly so, at times. At the end Sarah's afterword speaks about that honesty to her oldest son, for whom this was a preteen year - difficult enough even without his father being away. She also speaks about the photographer whose work illustrates the story, who became part of the family (a surprise to everyone, photographer Andrea included). Sarah Smiley writes engagingly, in her newspaper columns as well as here. This is nonfiction not to be missed.--Reviewed by Nina M.

She's known nothing but education and work, and she is now herself a brilliant surgeon. But Cherijo discovers something about her father that drives her out of his home and away from Earth, where he could still control her. She contracts her services to a colony world where Terrans are a small and not particularly valued minority of the population, and where she will be one of a pitifully small number of physicians caring for people whose species vary so much that some Cherijo doesn't even recognize as people until she's told that is what they are.Can she make it on her own? Can she learn how to treat nonhuman patients without receiving formal training - by figuring it out as she goes, sometimes at a breakneck pace? That would be challenge enough, but her father is determined to force her back to Earth. Then there's the epidemic that strikes the colony, a contagion which doesn't turn up on medical scanners and doesn't seem to care what species it attacks. Among the epidemic's victims is the handsome alien warrior whom Cherijo has swiftly come to love, to whom she has betrothed herself. Can she save his life, and stop the epidemic? And what will happen after she learns another and even more frightening of her father's secrets?This first novel in a series is crackling, fast-paced science fiction that reminds me of old-fashioned space opera.

"Ten years after her kidnapping and eventual rescue, Elizabeth Smart wrote this book (with ghostwriter Chris Stewart) to tell her own story. This is a different book entirely from the one published by her parents, and it should be. Elizabeth's viewpoint is that of the survivor, and ""survivor"" is the right word. ""Victim"" is not.I've read with interest some reviews in which readers express bafflement that Elizabeth should feel the need to defend her actions during her captivity. I don't find it surprising at all. Unfortunately, there were at the time - and there still are - far too many other people who express puzzlement that she didn't find a way to escape, or that she didn't take what seem to those people clear opportunities to ask for rescue. Elizabeth is clear with both herself and her readers: she did what she felt she had to do in order to survive. And she did survive. She also managed to heal. I'm not going to argue with how she did those things, because they worked for her. And that is what matters.With that said, the book is well written and well organized. Elizabeth understands what happened to her, and why; and she expresses herself clearly. It's difficult reading at times because of the subject matter, but ultimately it's a story of triumph. Love and faith were enough to bring this young woman through, and love and faith have also been enough to sustain her afterward.As for whatever she chose not to share with those of us reading her book - she has that right.

"In 2004 Chicago, a long retired Parks Department employee buys an opera ticket and an antique gun - a German Luger - so he can complete a self-assigned mission. He wants to force opera patron, businessman, and beloved philanthropist Elliot Rosenzweig to admit he's really Otto Piatek, a Nazi war criminal. The twist is that the retiree, Benjamin Solomon, and Otto Piatek grew up as foster brothers. Seeing ""Rosenzweig"" on a PBS broadcast, and realizing the man who betrayed both Ben and his family is not only still alive but living a prosperous and respectable life in the same city where Ben has lived since emigrating after the war, is more than the old man can take. He has to prove, in public, that this civic leader is both a butcher and a thief.Attorney Catherine Lockhart works impossible hours for a top-paid law firm, representing corporate clients. She's only two years past a breakdown, and happy to have a job at all - let alone one as prestigious and lucrative as this. But when asked by her lifelong best friend, a private investigator who believes in Ben Solomon's cause, she first reluctantly hears the old man out; and then she becomes equally determined to bring Otto Piatek to justice.I'm surprised that this is a first novel, because the writing is competent the techniques the author uses work well.

"A criminal genius targets forensic psychologist and Washington, DC detective Alex Cross, delving into Cross's life without his knowledge and then using what he learns to torture Cross by kidnapping his family. That's become almost a tired device for this series, but - to my surprise and pleasure - it works very well in this book nevertheless.Is the man's name really Thierry Mulch? What does he look like without a disguise? Is he, with or without his partner and lover's assistance, responsible for one series of gruesome murders, or for two such series? Cross has been on Mulch's trail for weeks before the mastermind moves against Cross's family - 91-year-old grandmother, second wife who's also a D.C. detective, teen-aged son and daughter from his first marriage, and grade school son by a lover who's no longer part of his life. Mulch models himself on the protagonist of CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, and his goal is to convince Alex Cross that life has no meaning. That the only valid reason for anyone's actions can be stated as: ""Because I can.""By the time this book ends (sort of; it's actually a monumental cliffhanger), Munch has put Cross through the ringer. While I understand very well the reviewers who've come away from this read feeling angry and cheated, I came away feeling relieved by the direction the plot turned during the last few pages; and although I don't like having to wait for the next book, I'm more than willing to do so.

So the 10 adopted Bennett children, their Irish nanny Mary Catherine, and Michael's grandfather Seamus (who entered the priesthood as an aging widower) have gone into the witness protection program. They're hiding on a remote high desert ranch, and in some ways Bennett's delighted with the effect of country life on his kids. But they all miss New York City, and the adults know that it's only a matter of time before Perrine's far reaching organization locates them. Nowhere is truly safe.Meanwhile, Perrine has declared war on the Mob. In a series of daring and terrifying raids, his people murder leaders who have angered Perrine by refusing to do business with him. The FBI decides it needs Michael Bennett's expertise, desperately enough to bring him out of hiding. They assign Federal marshals to protect his family, and Bennett goes back to work - only this time, it's for the Feds. Can he bring Perrine down before the drug lord's operatives find his family? That's the question.This is James Patterson at his best, in a fast paced, deftly plotted thriller that's all the more enjoyable for its depiction of the Bennetts.

"Belfa ""Bell"" Elkins grew up in Acker's Gap, West Virginia, and thought she'd never want to return. She and husband Sam headed off to Washington, D.C. with toddler daughter Carla, and not long after they settled there Bell became restless. So she went to law school, and joined Sam's profession. But Bell, unlike Sam, didn't want to spend her career taking care of lobbyists - she found herself needing to go home and fill the terrible needs in Acker's Gap for people with her training and her passion for justice. Now she's the county's prosecutor, and her closest friend is still the local cop who took her under his wing on the night 10-year-old Bell lost everything.People in Acker's Gap have long memories. Of course they know who Bell Dolan's people were. But the local cop who was a rookie when Bell was 10 years old is the sheriff now, and Bell herself has become an accomplished and respected professional woman. Her chosen battle is against the prescription drug trade that's brought big city crime to the hills, but even she doesn't at first view it as a likely motive when three old men are gunned down in a local eatery one Saturday morning. Carla Elkins, now a sullen teenager, is among the witnesses. Carla thinks she may have recognized the shooter. Does she tell her mother that, though? Or anyone in law enforcement? Of course not. She's a teenager, and she needs to do whatever she does on her own. She has no idea what kind of danger she's courting. Nor does Bell know how much danger she's placing herself in by pursuing her crusade.This is a rich novel, one that feels just as literary as mystery-like. Author Keller knows the people and place of her setting intimately, and she writes about them with an honesty that's both beautiful and frightening.

"Claudine Burroughs, a well-to-do woman who childless marriage has proved to be loveless and frustrating, has found fulfillment working with ill and injured prostitutes at a clinic run by former Crimean War nurse Hester Monk. Claudine's position in society still requires her to attend a round of holiday social events that, while they often bore her, at least offer chances for her to raise funds for the clinic. She's at such a gathering when she happens into the company of poet Dai Tregarron, who charms her even though she's surprised to see him where he clearly does not fit. Soon afterward, a prostitute lies dead on her wealthy host's terrace. Three young men who do belong at the gathering according to their social class claim that they saw Tregarron attack the woman, and that it took all three of them to subdue him - too late to save her life. That isn't what Claudine believes happened. As Tregarron tries to stay ahead of the law, and Christmas rapidly approaches, Claudine takes on the job of investigating the crime (since the police aren't likely to consider any story except the one the socially prominent young men have told them) and hopefully proving Tregarron innocent. She seeks help in doing so from the Portpool Lane Clinic's bookkeeper, a former brothel owner who started out disliking her but who has over time come to accord her a grudging respect.This is a bittersweet short novel, with its protagonist looking back on her own life and acknowledging its errors as she does her best to help another woman avoid them. That thread makes the story work. It's a quick, easy read, but one that should make any 21st Century woman think about how fortunate she is to have been born to this era instead of to Claudine's.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Charlotte ""Charlie"" McNally, veteran investigative reporter for a Boston TV station, has just become engaged to private school teacher Josh Geltson. The two of them have plans to tell the divorced Josh's young daughter, Penny, about their decision; but as usual, Charlie's personal life has to take a back seat when she finds herself in possession of a possible scoop. She believes that someone is ""cloning"" auto VINs (vehicle identification numbers) in order to make stolen cars vanish from law enforcement's radar. She also thinks that rental agencies and used car dealers alike may be putting customers at risk of renting or purchasing cars with unresolved safety recalls, and cars that have had their air bags stolen and replaced with newspapers. Of course Charlie has to pursue the investigation. But in the meantime, she's moving from her condo into Josh's faculty housing on his private school's campus. There's something strange going on there, too. Josh doesn't want Charlie to investigate, and no one seems to want the police involved; but when threatening phone calls to staff and faculty members expand to include students' parents, and when two beloved members of the school's staff die mysteriously, Charlie can't help herself. As she told her mother when she was a little girl reading the final chapter of a Nancy Drew book first: ""I hafta know!""Charlie at 47 has never before confronted the difficult job of balancing a partner and child's needs with the demands of her career, and she certainly has never before been a faculty spouse. Besides which, her producer, working partner, and dear friend Franklin is acting odd; and Charlie, who hates secrets, has to keep a huge one after her boss insists that she do so. Even from Franklin.This fourth novel in the series is the best one yet. Ryan's plotting and characterization are both deft, and the book's ending is both surprising and - as the ending of a good mystery ought to be - somehow inevitable. More Charlie McNally, please!

"Charlotte ""Charlie"" McNally, investigative reporter for a Boston TV station, fights her way off an airplane awaiting departure because she thinks she's scented a developing story. When she learns that she's mistaken, and finds herself stranded overnight, she discovers the silver lining in the disappointing situation when a different story presents itself. She realizes that something strange is happening with baggage claims at Boston's Logan Airport. Also, a woman who's collecting luggage from the same carousel as Charlie lets the reporter know that she can buy designer purses (or rather, knockoffs of those designs) on the cheap if she attends a ""party"" in the small town of Great Barrington.Charlie and her producer, Franklin, plot to air their fashion espionage story even though it's not what Channel 3's management (as personified by ""consultant"" Suzanne) wants them working on. Meanwhile, Charlie and the divorced private school teacher who's been her lover for the past year hit inevitable conflicts in their developing relationship. Can Josh accept Charlie as she is, work life that eats up private time and all? Can Charlie find a way to balance her growing commitment to Josh and his young daughter, Penny, with the career she chose 25 years ago and cannot even imagine giving up?This third novel in the Charlie McNally series once again includes a romance, and it's pivotal to the main character's life; but the book itself isn't a romance novel, no matter how the publisher chose to classify it.

"Senator Kerry Kilcannon learned politics in his boyhood, tutored by his godfather. He never really knew his much older brother, James; but after an assassin's bullet brought Jamie down during his run for the presidency, Kerry stepped into the role. Now Kerry is fighting to win the Democratic Party's nomination. As he races from event to event, he's stalked - without knowing it, of course - by an assassin of his own. One who has history with Kerry.He also has a secret to keep. The incumbent vice president, his opponent, has learned through a counselor's confidentiality breach that several years ago, Kerry's affair with a lovely reporter ended in the woman's choosing to abort his child. Kerry is divorced now, but he was still married then. And now, once again, Lara Costello is covering his campaign. Both careers, the candidate's and the correspondent's, will go down if the Mason campaign leaks their past history to the press.Those are the two major plot lines of this political thriller that, while it didn't have me on the edge my seat, nevertheless demanded that I finish it. It's a fine book. I skimmed my way through much of the two later books in the Kilcannon trilogy, with enough interest in Kerry and Lara remaining for me to give this initial volume a try. I really did enjoy it. Well written, well plotted, excellent characterization. I'll have to give Richard North Patterson's less political novels a try, since I love his writing despite my lack of enthusiasm for political intrigue.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"TV reporter Charlotte ""Charlie"" McNally has her hands full, as usual. Her station's hired a consultant to implement changes meant to attract a younger audience, and that consultant decides to treat July as if it were the November sweeps for ratings purposes. Her mother's not only in town, but hospitalized at an upscale plastic surgery clinic where Mrs. McNally - who will soon remarry - has undergone several procedures at once. When she's contacted by attorneys from an organization dedicated to reversing the convictions of prisoners it believes innocent, she and her producer, Franklin Parrish, jump on the chance to interview a notorious convicted murderer. If Dorinda Sweeney confessed falsely to killing her husband, then interviewing her in prison could provide Charlie with top ratings. But what happens if Dorie doesn't want to be interviewed, and isn't interested in having her conviction overturned? Why do people connected with the now three-year-old case start dying, and is snoopy Charlie going to be next?This fast-paced mystery's subplot continues Charlie's romance (begun in ""Prime Time"") with Josh Geltsen, as the divorced teacher introduces his 8-year-old daughter to his girlfriend. Charlie has no idea how to get Penny to talk to her, much less warm up to her and accept her relationship with Josh. Author Ryan does a good job of weaving this conflict into the primary plot, using Charlie's conflicted relationship with her own mother as the link.Well written and well paced.

"Attorney Caroline Masters left her family's summer home on Martha's Vineyard over 20 years ago, and has returned this summer for a solitary sailing vacation. She hasn't, in all those years, visited the family's permanent and historic home on Masters Hill in Resolve, New Hampshire. Nor has she been in touch with anyone from her earlier life. She moved to San Francisco, put herself through law school, and didn't look back. She had powerful reasons for making that drastic choice - but now, she can do nothing else but answer her aging father's summons. Even though doing so for this particular reason puts her nomination as a Federal appeals court judge in jeopardy.Caroline's niece, Brett Allen, stands accused of murdering her boyfriend. As the story unfolds, we learn that Brett Allen is Caroline's niece by adoption; but she is also Caroline's daughter, born 22 years ago and given up to Caroline's sister and brother-in-law at the age of three days. Caroline has no intention of telling Brett who she really is, but she cannot do otherwise when her father and sister (and brother-in-law Larry, whom she once considered a friend) ask her to help the girl avoid being charged with the crime - or, if this does happen, to defend Brett in court. It's not wise for a lawyer to take on the defense of someone close, and the possible adverse publicity from doing so could cause the president to withdraw Caroline's nomination. Caroline knows all that. So does the retired judge who is her father. But she can't help herself; she must do all she can for Brett, at any cost.I made the mistake of reading a political book as my introduction to Richard North Patterson, and I almost decided he wasn't the right author for me. Still, that first book - ""Protect and Defend"" - included such an intriguing character in Caroline Masters that I wanted to read the earlier novel in which she's the protagonist. That's this novel, and it is superb. Long, yes; but no scene is wasted, and the story twists and turns as Caroline struggles with the moral dilemma of her life. Will she be able to protect Brett? Is Brett innocent or guilty? And how badly will Caroline have to tarnish her own integrity before she's fulfilled her duty to her secret daughter? An absolute page turner of a book. I still don't care much for political novels, but if Richard North Patterson has more works like this then I must read them!--Reviewed by Nina M.

"TV reporter Charlotte McNally needs a story that will bring her Boston station top ratings during the November sweeps. In her middle 40s now, Charlie knows that winning a series of Emmys doesn't mean she can stop worrying about someone younger and cheaper taking her job away for her. She'd better keep on winning, both awards and ratings. But one story keeps pushing other leads aside; and unfortunately, it's a story that her young boss has ordered her not to pursue.Charlie's producer and good friend, Franklin, proves to be her faithful ally as she investigates a series of mysterious e-mails that seem connected to the death of a man in an apparent single car crash. Refinancing spam, right? Wrong. So Charlie suspects; and as she becomes certain, she realizes that the car crash was murder, indeed. Figuring out exactly who's behind the mystery waits, though, until very close to the book's end.Hank Phillippi Ryan wrote this book long before her two wonderful Jane Ryland novels, and I ordered it doubtfully when I noticed it was classified as a romance. It does include a romance, one that's funny and poignantly easy to believe, but it is actually a mystery. A well-plotted, well-written mystery, not as deft as either Jane Ryland book but a highly enjoyable tale nevertheless.

"They're on their way to the Italian mainland from their base in Sicily. The year is 1943, and this planeload of nurses and medics from the 807th Medical Air Evacuation Transport Squadron expects to land, performs its usual duties, and then return to base. Instead, fierce weather conditions and a lack of the codes required to get help from the ground combine to send them far off course. Only after their crash landing in mountainous terrain do they learn that they've strayed all the way across the Adriatic Sea, and have come down in Nazi-occupied Albania. While no one has died, there are injuries; and a long, dangerous distance stretches between the stranded Americans and the coast. Friendly partisans appear right after the crash, but the conflict between Albania's two ""freedom fighter"" groups may prove just as deadly to the survivors as the winter weather and the lack of food for even the kindest villagers to share.After the war, the nurses and medics of the 807th - it's no spoiler to say that they were, eventually, rescued - kept silent about their ordeal. Not only had they been ordered to do so, orders that the war's end did not change; Albania in the post-war years remained a perilous place for those who had helped the Americans, and silence was the only way to protect them. Finally, though, came the collapse of Soviet Communism in Europe as well as in the USSR itself. At last the one remaining 807th medic, now an old man living in a retirement community, could talk to author Cate Lineberry. So could the survivors of the other former captives, as some of them discovered unpublished materials - even a completed memoir manuscript, in one case - left behind by their deceased parents.I've been reading World War II nonfiction since I was a high school freshman, and that was going on 50 years ago. This isn't the best written book of its sort that I've encountered, but it tells a previously unknown and important story well enough so that I gulped it down in an evening. I especially valued finding out what the post-war period brought to the partisans who helped the stranded Americans. The cost of their escape was a high one. As the daughter of a World War II Pacific theater veteran who until he grew very old also ""just didn't want to talk about it,"" I value books like this one for what they capture while those who experienced this war are still with us to share their memories.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Claire Elliot moved to Tranquility, Maine several months ago, hoping for a new start with her teenaged son after the boy started getting in trouble. Noah didn't want to leave Baltimore, and both mother and son are still grieving two years after Claire's husband died of cancer. Tranquility does not take kindly to newcomers who move there year round. Although she bought the practice of the man who was the only local doctor, after his death, most of her patients have been summer visitors; and now, as winter approaches, Claire has far too open a schedule. She also has too few friends, but she knows she must keep her distance from the local police chief. Who is separated from his alcoholic wife, but still feels responsible for the woman - and who has, for Claire, the potential to become something closer than a friend.The town's teenagers grow restive as autumn wears on, and Claire finds herself patching up kids who have injured themselves or others in uncharacteristic outbursts of rage. When the outbursts turn serious, she starts wondering about rumors of something similar happening 50 years ago - so long that although the town's older residents remember it, the current generations of younger adults and children only know that they've been told to stay away from certain people. People like Claire's newest patient, an old man who comes to her notice during a very public seizure that causes his neighbors to draw away from him in terror instead of helping him as Claire knows they would anyone else. What is going on? Can she solve the mystery before it affects Noah, and before it gets her driven out of a town that would much rather ignore the mystery no matter what that may cost?Tess Gerritsen's competence as a writer made this book work quite well for me despite a final plot twist that I just couldn't accept.

Julian is a student at the Evensong boarding school in rural Maine, where every faculty member (Maura learns) belongs to the Mephisto Society. The students have one thing in common: every one of them has been the victim of violent loss. The three most recent arrivals have an additional similiarity. First, each survived the massacre of his or her family two years ago; and second, each has survived the recent murder of a foster family.

Then Maura calls her for help when strange and frightening things start to happen at Evensong, and soon Jane is putting together the pieces of a puzzle years old and spanning an ocean.Taut, well plotted, and intriguing, this book had me suspending what might otherwise be entirely reasonable disbelief.

"Sir Oliver Rathbone hasn't been a judge for long, and he's still adjusting to being separated - unwillingly - from his wife, Margaret. The unsavory case that cost him his wife's love does not appear to be harming his career, but the memory of it lingers. Arthur Ballinger, Margaret's father, operated a secret ""club"" for gentlemen who enjoyed forcing themselves on small boys. After Ballinger was convicted in spite of Rathbone's best attempt at defending him, Ballinger was murdered in prison. For that, Margaret blames Oliver, who has managed to protect her from knowing the worst about her father. Ballinger's final revenge was leaving his collection of pornographic photos to his son-in-law. Those photos were taken as the price of each member's admission to his ""club,"" each photograph showing the would-be member performing an illegal act with a child.Rathbone often wishes he had destroyed the collection as soon as it was delivered to him, but so far he has not been able to give up the power over evil men that it represents. When a case before his court is clearly going wrong, with a clergyman who has defrauded and impoverished his flock about to be acquitted although Rathbone is certain of the man's guilt, the judge does what he knows he has no business doing. He takes from the collection an image of the defense's most vital witness, and uses it to influence the case; and he does so without recusing himself. Soon after that he finds himself under arrest for perverting the course of justice.River Police Commander William Monk and his wife, Hester, a former army nurse who operates a clinic for sick and injured prostitutes, have been Rathbone's friends for years now. They are also the foster parents of 13-year-old Scuff, who was a street urchin and one of Arthur Ballinger's captives. Helping Rathbone now is risky for them, but Hester played a key role in launching the case of the fraudulent clergyman; and Monk, by his nature, feels driven to seek the truth even after his superiors order him to have nothing to do with the accused and imprisoned judge. As for Scuff, the boy is still learning to trust his new parents' love and the safety their home offers. If they let Rathbone go down in order to keep themselves from sharing his disgrace, what lesson will they teach Scuff? That love is always conditional?My one criticism of Anne Perry's latest Victorian mystery is the amount of time it took to get to Rathbone's disgrace and arrest. For me the book dragged during the long courtroom scenes leading up to that moment; but I don't know how the author could have avoided those scenes, or shortened them, without sacrificing vital elements of her plot.

"It will soon be Christmas in northern Minnesota. In Tamarack County, an elderly woman - wife of a retired judge - disappears, leaving her car out of gas and abandoned. Her husband, who left the bench under a cloud, appears to be fast spiraling down into dementia. Private investigator Cork O'Connor, who used to be sheriff, doesn't immediately connect this possible crime with another that happens nearby, on the Ojibwe reservation. A friendly dog who's being cared for by the family of a man serving a short county jail sentence is lured with meat and then decapitated. One possible serious crime, assuming that Evelyn Clark hasn't simply become lost in the blizzard that closed down shortly after her disappearance, and one chilling but legally not-so-serious crime; both of which Cork investigates because that's what he does. When it becomes clear that the woman who was dog-sitting is being stalked, or that her teenaged daughter is the target (which, Cork can't immediately tell), the concern hits close to home because Cork's teenaged son is experiencing his first love with that pretty girl. Or is either the mother or the daughter actually the stalker's target? Meanwhile, Cork's middle child - daughter Anne, always the calm and sunny and grounded one - comes home early for Christmas, because she may be abandoning her long quest to become a nun. The widowed lawman is also unsettled by the loneliness and uncertainty of having a woman he may love, and who may love him in return, go away and not ask for or give promises. Not about how the two of them should behave during their separation, and not about when (or even whether) she'll return.This newest installment in Krueger's excellent series lived up to my expectations, and then some. It had the twists and turns I've come to expect from this author, and it also had first rate characterizations of not just the O'Connors and their long time associates; as usual, it also did well with characters newly introduced. Krueger's work always has a depth to it that goes beyond the bounds of genre.

"Quebec's top homicide investigator, Chief Inspector Gamache, has had a difficult year. First he nearly died in a raid that went wrong, and his beloved second-in-command - a surrogate son, and prospective son-in-law - became addicted to prescription drugs after being gravely wounded in that raid. Then, as Gamache wrapped up the case of a cloistered monk's murder, his relationship with Jean-Guy Beauvoir went completely off the rails. Beauvoir went back to pill popping, egged on and even supplied by none other than the Surete du Quebec's commander in chief - a man who proceeds to transfer Gamache's people, one by one, to other divisions or otherwise get rid of them. Gamache is being sidelined, and his new detectives treat him with disrespect that sometimes becomes outright contempt. None of it seems to bother Gamache, though. Is he finally getting ready to retire? That's what everyone seems ready to assume.Meanwhile, an elderly woman named Constance Pineault plans a second visit to the southern Quebec village of Three Pines. She fails to arrive, and the woman she was to visit contacts Gamache because he's an old friend. Digging into the disappearance, which quickly turns out to be murder, reveals that ""Pineault"" was what Constance called herself; but not her real surname. Which some of the quirky Three Pines villagers already know...but to others, the truth is a shocker when it's revealed.Gamache has two cases on his plate by then, as he realizes that the apparent suicide of a government clerk was actually a murder. A murder committed to hide a conspiracy decades in the making, that will - unless Gamache can unravel the mystery it presents in time - result in an act of domestic terrorism that could shatter the Dominion forever.I always enjoy two things in particular about Louise Penny's novels. First, I love her characters. They have layers and nuances; no one is a cardboard cutout, or even comes close to being one. Second, I love the way she draws apparently unrelated plot threads together so that by the book's end it is clear to me that they always were related.

He's come a long way from the alcoholic rookie detective who finally won over his first partner, a veteran cop nicknamed Pickles. When that man's daughter calls Beaumont on New Year's Eve and asks if she may bring him something she found while cleaning out her parents' home following her mother's death, Beau isn't expecting what the woman delivers. Pickles aspired to write a book about his career; and his daughter wants Beau to have the chapter about their partnership.That's the framing story for this novella that does a fine job of contrasting the young man Beaumont once was with the mature detective he eventually becomes. I read it at the hairdresser's; it's a quick one, due to its brief length, but it's a ""don't miss"" for series fans.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Sarah Fontaine wakes to a ringing telephone, and learns that her husband of two months has died in a hotel fire. The problem is that Geoffrey is supposed to be staying in London, on business; but the State Department caller says he died in Berlin. What is going on? Sarah sets out to answer that question, and soon Nick D'Arcy - the man who called her with the news - finds himself on involuntary leave, and following her as she heads for London in search of answers.This is definitely a romance novel, not a medical thriller. It's one of Tess Gerritsen's Harlequin titles, written before she changed genres; and taken on its own terms, it works fine.

"Recently divorced Julia Hamill digs in the garden of her 1830s Boston cottage and finds a skeleton. While it's too old to be a medical examiner case, it's definitely a murder victim - but whose skeleton is it?In 19th Century Boston, medical student Norris Marshall struggles against an impoverished background to get his education and enter a profession for which he has both passion and aptitude. More aptitude, in fact, than some of his much wealthier classmates. In order to fund his studies, he assists a grave robber. That's how the medical school gets cadavers for its students to dissect. Norris watches the way women in the teaching hospital's maternity ward are treated with disapproval, sympathy, and even horror; for it's an era when doctors do not know they need to wash their hands. He takes an interest in immigrant Rose Connolly, who has come to the hospital with her married sister for the birth of the sister's baby. Aurnia dies following her daughter's difficult delivery, a victim of childbed fever - the infection doctors commonly spread from patient to patient, without knowing themselves to be the cause. Rose takes her newborn niece and runs when the hospital's head nurse informs her that she must give the child up; and Norris soon realizes there's more going on than charitable services deciding Rose isn't suited to care for a baby alone. Meanwhile, people in the hospital's neighborhood start dying. Rose, witness to one of the first in a series of murders, therefore has added reason to hide herself and Meggie.That's the setup for this story which switches back and forth between centuries, a device that works surprisingly well. The difficulty I had with this book was caring about its characters as I needed to care in order to enjoy it fully. I didn't get on board with that until a present-day octogenarian joined the cast. It did happen then, though!A good story overall, but not as compelling as other Gerritsen thrillers I've read.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Boston medical examiner Maura Isles has reached a turning point in her life. She knows it's time to end her clandestine love affair with a Roman Catholic priest who clearly isn't going to leave his church for her, and leaving town for a few days to attend a pathology conference in Wyoming gives her time in which to think about her future. It also prompts her to consider changing her usual careful way of behaving. When an old classmate from medical school invites her to join him, along with his 13-year-old daughter (he's divorced) and two of his friends who are a couple as they head for a ski lodge instead of flying home promptly after the conference's end, Maura accepts. She soon regrets it, though. Her old classmate insists on driving where the GPS in his rented Suburban directs him, and the result is the group becoming stranded high in the mountains as winter's first major snowstorm closes in. They take shelter in a settlement that's clearly designed for off-the-grid living, and wonder why its inhabitants abandoned it so abruptly that they find meals still on dining tables. Abandoned pets now long dead, and vehicles stowed inside garages. What can possibly have happened, and who were these people, anyway? And without cell phone service, how can Maura and her companions hope for rescue before the seasonal road reopens when spring arrives? Those questions are scary enough. But the worst part is that they're not alone in the valley, after all.This installment in the Rizzoli and Isles series has the usual taut suspense, and having both lead characters carry the story - in alternating chapters (or blocks thereof) - always works well. Jane Rizzoli and her husband, FBI agent Gabriel Dean, search for their friend even after everyone else has given up; and even when a charred body found in the wreckage of a Suburban is identified as Maura, Jane is sure something's wrong. The tale's ending has a tragic but effective twist, and characters introduced in recent books appear again here in ways that make real contributions. This a series I'll continue to follow for sure.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Mark E. Nickerson always wanted to be a Maine State trooper, like his father before him. His father wanted Mark to be a dentist. Mark followed his own chosen career, and now - many years later, as a retiree - he has written about it. I don't remember meeting him during my own many years an employee of the State of Maine, but I do remember the era; it was mine, too. That added to my enjoyment of this volume of reminiscences gathered from Mark Nickerson's newspaper columns, but I suspect I would still have found it an interesting read if I'd come to it without that common background.Being a trooper isn't like being a TV cop. Especially, being a trooper on patrol in rural Maine isn't like being a law enforcement professional elsewhere.

"The Discovery Channel is filming as a Boston hospital donates the services of its CAT scan laboratory to the examination of a mummy discovered in the basement of a local museum, and medical examiner Maura Isles is on the scene as an invited guest. She soon goes into official on-duty mode, though, because the scan shows two things it shouldn't. First, the mummy has modern dental work; and second, it's got a bullet embedded in one leg. A mummy it may be, but ancient Egyptian it's not. So how did it get into the Crispin Museum's basement, and how long has it been lying there?Homicide detective Jane Rizzoli isn't on the best of terms with her friend Dr. Isles, because even though Jane doesn't believe in the Roman Catholic faith of her childhood she nevertheless disapproves heartily of Maura's more or less secret liaison with a priest. Still, the two women must work together as usual on this case that soon widens as more meticulously preserved bodies are found; and as investigation ties the corpses to disappearances of young women, all of similar appearance, over a wide geographic span and over a period of 25 years.This one cost me the best part of a night's sleep. I made the mistake of starting to read it in the evening, and I found myself unable to fall asleep until I'd finished. While the regular characters from the series were in good form, I found myself drawn in and held by the characters introduced for this story only. THE KEEPSAKE is a fine mystery, for sure.

"Two young women are dead, and at both murder scenes Boston homicide detective Jane Rizzoli has found apparently satanic symbols. The murders themselves are horrific and ritualistic; they definitely aren't the work of a killer who's simply become angry enough to snap. Still, the very earthbound Rizzoli doesn't buy it at all when a mysterious organization that calls itself the Mephisto Club involves itself in her investigation. Medical examiner Maura Isles doesn't buy it, either; she's a scientist, and does not wish to believe in anything she cannot prove through evidence. Yet the Mephisto Club wants Dr. Isles as a member, and the killer must be aware of her because he (or she?) marks Maura's house. What's the involvement of Lily Saul, a young American woman on the run in Europe? From whom or what is Lily fleeing; and is she right to be afraid?This book's graphic detailing of violence and its aftermath might well have overloaded me (I haven't the world's strongest stomach) if author Gerritsen had not made this material such a necessary part of the story she had to tell. While I found the ending a bit disappointingly convenient, it retained enough creepiness to keep me from feeling truly let down. It takes a lot of skill for a writer to mix speculative fiction with another genre such as mystery/suspense and pull it off. Gerritsen does so here, and in fine style, too.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"How could this have happened? Dr. Maura Isles, Boston's medical examiner, asks that question after she discovers that the inhabitant of a body bag in her morgue is alive. The public wants answers, too; but things really get interesting when, once in the hospital, the ""corpse"" proceeds to take hostages. One of those hostages is a friend of Maura's, homicide detective Jane Rizzoli. Jane is there as a patient - she's been admitted to have her baby. The ""Jane Doe"" with the gun (stolen from a security guard who wasn't actually employed by the hospital) has an Eastern European accent, and she means business. Jane Rizzoli's husband, FBI agent Gabriel Dean, insists on working with the Boston PD crisis team that takes command of the situation; but he soon discovers that he's not the only Federal agent on the scene. Something strange is going on, and Gabriel fears that whatever it is may get priority over keeping his wife and unborn baby alive.This thriller demanded that I read it straight through. I like the ways in which Maura Isles is being fleshed out, as she continues as a major character in the series that started with Jane Rizzoli alone.

"Dr. Maura Isles, Boston's medical examiner, already knows she's adopted. She knows nothing about her birth family, though; so when a woman who looks exactly like her is shot to death while sitting in a car parked in front of Maura's house, she's astonished. She had an identical twin, and never knew it.Now it's up to Detective Jane Rizzoli and the rest of Boston's homicide division to solve the murder of a woman whose very name proves to be a mystery. Was she even the killer's target, or was Dr. Isles the intended victim? Maura now not only wants to know everything possible about her background; she needs to know, because that may be her key to staying alive. As the murder investigation and Maura's own search proceed, the pathologist begins to realize that her birth mother may be a convicted and mentally ill murderer. That the blood of killers may be running in her veins. How can she, a law enforcement professional as well as a scientist, deal with such knowledge?This book is decidedly Isles-centered, and it's a fine thriller. I found it a bit too bloody for my taste, but I'm squeamish and I know it; other readers will no doubt take those scenes in stride. The mystery works well, and author Gerritsen is wise not to try to explain evil. I guessed wrong about the final plot twist. Good; I hate it when I guess right every time a particular author tries to fool me, which Gerritsen does with success.

"Two nuns lie on the floor in the convent's chapel. The young one, a girl of 20 who had yet to take her final vows, has been beaten to death. The older one, age 68, is still alive despite the beating she's taken. Boston homicide detective Jane Rizzoli does not enjoy being inside a convent; she stopped practicing her family's Catholic faith long ago, and besides that she is dealing with a secret dilemma of her own. Medical examiner Maura Isles, who attended Catholic schools as a girl, feels the old awe of nuns as she does her own job in this ugly situation. Did the murderer believe he'd killed both victims? Why did this happen, anyway? And, after Dr. Isles performs the autopsy and discovers that the 20-year-old nun had just given birth, what happened to the newborn baby?Author Gerritsen presents the reader with several different, apparently unrelated plot threads, and brings them together in ways that seem inevitable when it happens. Jane Rizzoli grows as a character, not necessarily becoming more likable but definitely becoming far more understandable and human. And as for Maura Isles, this is the book in which the medical examiner develops from a minor character into a major one. Her friendship with Rizzoli also develops, and those aspects of the book are just as satisfying as the mystery itself. Another keeper.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Jane Rizzoli, Boston homicide detective, has learned fear from a serial killer nicknamed the Surgeon. A year ago she apprehended him, and he's now behind bars; but she remembers far too well what it was like to become prey. Pinned to a cellar's dirt floor by scalpel blades driven through her palms, helpless until the victim she was seeking to rescue managed to shoot and disable their assailant...Jane checks her apartment every time she enters it, now. She has nightmares. And when a case she's investigating starts to show similarities to the Surgeon's M.O., she recognizes those similarities and speaks up about them - to the consternation of both her lieutenant, and FBI agent Gabriel Dean. This new serial killer, nicknamed the Dominator, also has his own M.O.; but soon the two merge, not long after the Surgeon escapes from prison. Now Gabriel Dean knows Jane Rizzoli is the pair's target, as the two serial killers work together, and Rizzoli doesn't seem interested in protecting herself if the cost of doing so must be thinking of herself as a victim. Rizzoli has never done that. And she doesn't want to start now.This taut thriller follows THE SURGEON, and it builds on that book's story in ways that might make it an awkward stand-alone read. Jane Rizzoli gains added dimensions as a character here, and two new arrivals - medical examiner Maura Isles, and FBI agent Gabriel Dean - become part of her life. I found Rizzoli authentic as a woman working in a ""masculine"" profession, in a generation for which this makes her a pioneer. I know about that; I wasn't a cop, but I did that, too.Scary and well paced, and I loved the foreshadowing at the story's end. I don't normally appreciate an author who makes me read the next book in a series; it usually makes me feel manipulated.

"Boston homicide detective Jane Rizzoli has spent her lifetime battling for acceptance in male dominated settings. She's learned to fight hard for the credit, when a male detective would not have to worry about receiving it; and she's learned those women who appear to be victims get nothing but scorn. She's also learned that a woman's physical appearance matters more than her skills and abilities. So she doesn't much like Dr. Catherine Cordell, the beautiful and gifted surgeon who relocated to Boston from Savannah two years earlier. Dr. Cordell crosses Jane's radar when a series of homicides shows marked similarities to an attack on Catherine Cordell, one in which she became the sole survivor of a madman's killing spree that ended when she managed to shoot him dead. Dr. Cordell has told no one in Boston, not even her partner and friend Peter Falco, about Savannah. But now, just as she thinks she has found a new life she can live in safety, either the Surgeon (so-called) has risen from the dead or a copycat is at work. In any case, soon he's taunting Catherine in ways that make it clear to Jane Rizzoli and fellow detective Thomas Moore than Dr. Cordell is the killer's ultimate target.I had my doubts about reading a thriller written by a physician, because blood and gore doesn't appeal to me. However, a tautly plotted book with characters worth caring about appeals to me very much indeed; and that's what I found THE SURGEON to be.

"San Francisco homicide detective Lindsay Boxer gives birth at last, at the age of 40, to a beautiful daughter. She does this during a storm-induced power outage, at home with a crew of firefighters helping her. Husband Joe Molinari, former Deputy Director of Homeland Security, arrives after the big event; but he's the one who stays at home with baby Julie, after his consulting contract is canceled due to budget cuts and Lindsay shows signs of needing to go back to work as soon as possible. She's a distracted new mother nevertheless, and even the awakening from coma of a convicted serial killer doesn't hold her attention when Julie has to be hospitalized with a mysterious blood condition. This particular killer has become obsessed with Lindsay, and he promises to reveal the dumping ground where he left his victims only if she will participate. Is he playing with the cops in general, and Lindsay in particular? Probably. Yet Sergeant Boxer can't refuse even a chance of finding those missing bodies and giving closure to the women's families.Meanwhile, medical examiner Claire Washburn - Lindsay's best friend - has to step aside for a hopefully temporary replacement after a body disappears from her morgue. A security guard also vanishes, and the investigation goes nowhere. Lindsay and partner Rich Conklin investigate a professor who claims he can ""see"" murders before they are committed; and ADA Yuki Castellano prosecutes a man who's on trial for murdering his wife and his young daughter. The wife's body has been found, but the daughter remains missing.As usual, there's a lot going on in this latest installment of the Women's Murder Club mysteries. Lindsay Boxer's crisis with her newborn has harrowing moments, and the murderer who's trying to mess with her mind (and to some extent succeeding) is downright creepy. I have to give this one five stars because I read it straight through. Couldn't put it down, and that is the simple truth. But I do hate it when a book ends with a cliffhanger...and this book does.

"San Francisco homicide detective Lindsay Boxer is pregnant at almost 40, after finally agreeing to marry her long time lover, former Deputy Homeland Security Director Joe Molinari. She's supposed to slow down, take it easy, and stay safe. But Boxer loves what she does, and she doesn't know how to dial it back when she and partner Rich Conklin must investigate two cases at once. First there's the garden at a famed actor's mansion, where heads are buried. Many heads, and the police still wouldn't know about them if someone hadn't dug up a couple and left them on display for the housekeeper to find. Second, there's a string of executions of known drug dealers; and the evidence strongly suggests a rogue cop is the shooter. Boxer's boss, Lieutenant Jackson Brady, thinks the shooter may be Chief of Police Warren Jacobi, who's on medical leave following hip replacement surgery. Who's also Boxer's former partner, a friend so dear to her that he gave her away at her wedding.The rest of the Women's Murder Club gang is very much part of this story, of course. Medical examiner Claire figures into it on her own, while ADA Yuki Castellano tries to figure out how to deal with two things about her new love, Jackson Brady. First, he's Lindsay's boss. And second, he's married. Reporter Cindy Thomas is now living with Rich Conklin, and that means she's pumping two ""unnamed police sources"" in her quest for newsworthy information - friend Lindsay plus partner Rich.The resolution of one mystery felt awfully convenient to me, but the other was both logical and just plain tragic. Lindsay's relationship with Joe plays a large part in the story, and I was sorry when (mild spoiler alert, stop reading if you don't want to know! line break to help with that)the case was solved before Joe started working Lindsay's case in his role as outside consultant.

"A teenaged girl stumbles along a remote road in the dark of night, clad only in a rain poncho and bleeding in the aftermath of giving birth. When passersby call 911 and she's safe in a hospital, she tells differing stories to San Francisco homicide detective Lindsay Boxer; and veteran investigator Lindsay is sure none of those stories is true. What she does know is that somewhere out there the girl's baby, a boy (that much remains consistent), may still be alive. If Lindsay can find him in time.Meanwhile, ADA Yuki Castellano - also one of the four members of what reporter Cindy Thomas has jokingly dubbed the Women's Murder Club - prosecutes a case that she's sure she can win, because the evidence against the defendant seems overwhelming. When Lindsay Boxer learns there's new information about this case, and follows it up because one of Lindsay's subordinate detectives handled the investigation, Yuki is incensed. She needs this win, and besides that - she's sure the right person is standing trial. But Lindsay isn't sure; and until she figures things out to her own satisfaction, she will pursue the case in spite of orders from Lieutenant Jackson Brady to stand down. Brady and Yuki Castellano are dating, and that makes the whole thing even more uncomfortable for Lindsay.This is the book in which Lindsay Boxer finally marries her long time love, former Homeland Security Deputy Director Joe Molinari. She's pushing 40, and her biological clock starts going off big time now that she has the right partner. So dealing with a missing newborn bothers Lindsay even more than it normally would; and it's just as hard on her best friend, Claire, San Francisco's medical examiner, who has a baby daughter of her own as well as two much older sons. The anniversary referenced in the book's title is that of Claire and Lindsay's friendship, and I liked the idea of celebrating a relationship that for these two women is one of life's enduring touchstones. The plot threads sometimes get a bit entangled in this one, but overall it's a great read.--Reviewed by Nina M.

Kitty strikes while the wealthy owners of each burglarized home are downstairs entertaining, and his or her target is jewelry kept in a bedroom safe upstairs. Wealthy people usually leave such a safe unlocked while the lady of the house is wearing some of her finery, so Kitty can take the rest without delay or difficulty - until the Dowlings, a famed actor and his wife, walk in during the robbery.

Meanwhile, homicide detective Lindsay Boxer and her partner are charged with solving a nasty string of shootings. The victims are always a young mother and her infant or small child, the venue is always a public place such as a parking garage, and the killer leaves behind a cryptic message written in lipstick. What does he want? And what will it take to stop him?Lindsay's engagement to former Deputy Director of Homeland Security Joe Molinari carries the couple into a transition period in their relationship, as they live together now that Joe has changed jobs and relocated to be with Lindsay. Her relationships with others are in transition, too; especially the one she shares with her handsome and considerably younger partner, who's thinking about moving in with her good friend Cindy.I liked the way PTSD figured into this book's plot, and I found the ways in which the two cases tied in together more credible than is sometimes true for this series. ""People aren't always what they appear to be"" forms one of the book's themes. On to #10! This series has its flaws, but I'm finding it addictive just the same.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Once again the women who jokingly call themselves ""The Women's Murder Club"" have different cases to deal with. Assistant District Attorney Yuki Castellano is hoping her losing streak may end with the conviction of a woman who bludgeoned her father to death and left her mother for dead - how could that go wrong, since the defendant's mother has identified her assailant in a video shot just after the crime? Homicide detective Lindsay Boxer is investigating the supposed death of a missing adolescent, Michael Campion, at a prostitute's home and place of business. Michael Campion is the son of a beloved former governor, and the heart defect he's had since birth makes his death during his first sexual experience all too plausible a possibility. Lindsay also has a serial killer or killers on her hands, as someone is talking his or her way into the homes of wealthy couples and committing robbery followed by murder. Murder by arson, leaving the victims bound and helpless to escape. Medical examiner Claire and reporter Cindy are less involved in this book than in some others of the series, although Claire goes on performing autopsies despite her advanced state of pregnancy.Lindsay's personal relationships go up and down in this story. She's finally living with her lover, former Homeland Security Deputy Director Joe Molinari, and he's given her an engagement ring; but she cannot bring herself to wear it, and accept his marriage proposal. She continues to struggle with sexual chemistry between her and her new partner, who's 10 years younger but doesn't care because he has an almost overwhelming crush on her. Will she ever dare to commit to Joe, despite knowing that she really does love him? And if not, how long will he wait after changing his whole life in order to be a day-to-day part of hers?It's possible for even a reader who loves Lindsay's character to get a bit impatient with her, and where Yuki is going I don't know after this book. However, as usual the plot threads came together by the story's end; and I really liked the final scene, in which readers find out something that Lindsay presumably never does.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"She was once a student at an exclusive private school, the acknowledged although illegitimate daughter of a rich and powerful man. When her father died, though, ""Pet Girl"" and her mother learned he'd made no provision for them. Suddenly they were poor, and decades later the adult she's become must use her girlhood connections to make a living by doing dog walking and other errands for women who were once her classmates. None of them hesitates to let her know how much they despise her now. ""Pet Girl"" has plans for them...all of them. Plans she's only now beginning to carry out.Wealthy, prominent couples are dying mysteriously, and autopsy results confound San Francisco's medical examiner. Homicide detective Lindsay Boxer has never seen her best friend baffled before, but this time Claire hasn't a clue why the men and women on her autopsy tables are dead. Meanwhile, reporter Cindy Thomas - another member of the ""Women's Murder Club"" - investigates the death of a street person, a man nicknamed Bagman Jesus and apparently beloved by all the fellow homeless folk who knew him; and Assistant DA Yuki Castellano starts falling in love for the first time in years. She's not thrilled that this is happening to her with a physician from the staff of San Francisco Municipal Hospital, where her mother died and where Yuki hates to see anyone treated. But that's where the man works, and it's been far too long since she felt this way about anyone.The twists and turns in this book kept me turning pages, as novels in this series usually do. I found the resolution, at least the part that tied two of the cases together, a bit too convenient; but otherwise the plot worked well. Lindsay's feelings about partner Rich's attraction to Cindy surprised me a lot less than they surprised Lindsay, and I liked the way that part turned out. I'll find the next chapter in Detective Boxer's life very interesting, I think. I plan to start reading it tonight.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco Police Department's homicide squad has multiple cases on her hands, apparently thanks to two serial killers. The ""car girl"" murders leave attractive young women dead of suffocation, dressed in expensive clothing and posed inside luxury cars whose owners have nothing to do with the crimes. Meanwhile, at San Francisco Municipal Hospital, patients admitted through the ER die when there's no good reason for them to do so. Most of them are like Keiko, mother of Lindsay's friend Yuki Castellano. The 55-year-old woman is recovering well and due to go home the next day when she suddenly dies due to an accidental dose of a blood thinner - a massive dose, that ends her life just as surely as an equally erroneous dose of insulin ends that of a boy who isn't a diabetic. Each patient who dies due to such mysterious ""human error"" has buttons placed on his or her closed eyes, buttons with the medical profession's symbol on them. The hospital does not want anyone to know about the buttons, and it presents the deaths as tragic but genuine cases of medical treatment gone awry. Lindsay suspects and pursues the ER's head physician, while successful defense attorney Yuki stops going to work and obsesses about her mother's death to the point where her friends fear for her health.This taut thriller has plenty of twists and turns, and I enjoyed getting to know Yuki better. The ""car girls"" case wraps up a bit faster and more neatly than I would have preferred, but the ER deaths case has just the right resolution. A good one, all in all.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Some time ago Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer asked her captain to put her back on the street as a detective, and let someone else command the San Francisco PD's homicide squad. When she finally gets her wish, though, she's no longer certain the demotion is what she wants - especially when the new lieutenant turns out to be her former partner and close friend, Warren Jacobi. She finds herself paired with the handsome young detective who was Jacobi's most recent partner; and when she breaks off her long distance romance with Deputy Director of Homeland Security Joe Molinari, sparks start flying that could burn both detectives. Meanwhile, there's a case to be investigated; and one of its victims is Lindsay's best friend, the city's medical examiner. Claire survives the shooting on board a ferry, but others aren't so lucky when a former mental patient uses his gun to right some perceived wrongs.Is the man sane in the legal sense, or is he incapable of understanding what he has done? That question proves vital as this story plays out. Meanwhile, Lindsay also investigates the kidnapping of a little girl whose father is the publisher of reporter Cindy Thomas's newspaper; and in Cindy's new apartment building, someone is killing anyone and anything that makes too much noise.Three plots sounds like too many to keep straight, but I didn't find it so as I read.

"When her former partner comes to the restaurant where Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer is relaxing with friends, off duty and enjoying a few margaritas, she tells him that she's been drinking but is not impaired. He agrees with that assessment, and the two detectives head off in pursuit of the Mercedes that has been seen at an otherwise lead-free crime scene. The pursuit ends with the Mercedes crashing, and its occupants - two young teenagers - bursting into tears. The cops holster their weapons and start rendering aid to what they now see as a pair of terrified, injured accident victims. So when the 15-year-old driver pulls out a gun and shoots both detectives, Boxer has to get at her own weapon again and fire it from the ground. By which time the young passenger has also pulled out a gun and used it to put bullets into a cop.Boxer shoots the young girl dead, and the boy - the girl's brother - winds up paralyzed. Although Internal Affairs quickly determines her use of deadly force to be justified, and although Boxer's partner barely survives and Boxer is herself seriously wounded, the kids' parents sue for police brutality. As she awaits her trial, Boxer leaves San Francisco for her sister's home in Half Moon Bay. Caring for a vacant house while her sister and family are away on vacation, in a picturesque coastal town, sounds perfect. Unfortunately, though, Half Moon Bay has its own string of unsolved murders going on; and Boxer soon realizes they may have a connection to her very first murder investigation, which still remains open. She can't help meddling. Which, of course, puts her in danger as the killer realizes she just may be able to do what the local police can't.Sometimes I want to shake Lindsay Boxer for not being able to resist temptation. Yet in the end it all comes out well for her, every time; and of course if she did behave herself, there'd be no story (or not much of one) for me to read. This tale is well paced, has a good twist at the end, and does a great job of bringing in a new ""Women's Murder Club"" character to take over the empty spot following Jill's death.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Unemployed former banker Jonathan Southard can't stand it. He's married to a woman just like his mother, something he realizes as Esther lets him know she's leaving him - but not until his 401(K) pays out, so she can share in its proceeds. Jonathan believes his mother, Abigail, did the same thing to his father; and that's what makes him snap, and kill his family. He leaves Thousand Oaks, CA after turning his home's air conditioner down to preserve the bodies as long as possible, and he heads for Tucson, AZ, where his mother has settled and remarried. He's going to settle that score, on his own and his now remarried father's behalf, before he crosses the border to a new life in Mexico.Angelina Enos is four years old, and she's delighted that her mother's boyfriend has included her in an outing that will take them to the annual party for the botanical garden's Queen of the Night bloom. That's a cactus which looks dead and ugly until the one night of the year when it opens fragrant white buds, into flowers that close before dawn. Far out in the desert, Angelina hides in a parked vehicle while someone kills her mother and her mother's boyfriend because they've happened upon the scene of two planned murders - that of the former Abigail Southard, and her second husband.Meanwhile, retired sheriff Brandon Walker takes on the one case that his long time friend and fellow retired detective couldn't solve. ""Geet"" is dying now, and old though the case is he actually has a new lead that he's medically unable to follow up. Brandon has his own concerns as well as the case, which he takes up under the auspices of The Last Chance, a charitable organization which attempts to solve cold cases in order to give families closure. Brandon is desperately afraid that Diana Ladd Walker, acclaimed writer and his second wife for more than 30 years, is developing dementia. He knows what that looks like, because it caused his father's death. He's afraid to broach the subject even with Diana, despite the warning signs he's been seeing for some months now; and he certainly isn't ready to discuss it with his stepson, David, an attorney who's in the middle of a divorce. Nor with his adopted daughter, Native American medical doctor and medicine woman Lani Walker - who finds herself involved in the case of Angelina Enos, when an Apache border patrolman brings the little girl to Lani's hospital emergency room.Some of this story's resolution seems awfully convenient, but it works nevertheless. The characters are interesting and easy to care about, and I enjoyed seeing Lani learn to appreciate an individual who happens to be half Apache - the tribe so hated by her own people that their words for ""enemy"" and ""Apache"" are exactly the same. This is the tale that brings the Walker saga up to date, and while it isn't quite as compelling as DAY OF THE DEAD, it is every bit as good in its own way.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Dr. Larry Stryker and his wife, Gayle, have been honored by their community as man and woman of the year. They've long operated a charity called Medicos for Mexico - an organization that exists to provide free medical care to impoverished people who would otherwise never see a doctor. These are good people. Friends, as far as Diana Ladd Walker is concerned. So why does Brandon Walker, unwillingly retired former sheriff and Diana's husband, dislike and distrust them?The Strykers, we learn early in this novel that's billed as suspense and at times comes close (in my opinion) to horror, have had secret lives since 1970. That was the year Larry learned he had impregnated a mute Native American girl who was his patient, and the year when Gayle cleaned up after him by killing the girl and disposing of her body. Ever since then, the couple's relationship has become more and more perverted; and so have their pleasures. Now Gayle's lover for the past five years, a much younger man who owes his job and lifestyle to her patronage, decides he wants a normal life. Gayle can't allow any man to break off with her. She sets out to frame him, and the detective who investigates the case manages to do what the Strykers cannot imagine possible. Brian Fellows, partly thanks to his own investigatory skills and partly thanks to his close relationship with Brandon Walker, makes the connection between the 30-year-old cold case and the current one. For Brandon Walker has a new career at last, donating his time and skill to an organization that investigates cold murder cases; and it just happens that he's recently taken on that of the mute and mysteriously pregnant girl found dismembered in an ice chest.Yes, I know this book is rife with coincidences. Somehow I didn't care, and once I began reading I found myself unable to stop. I had to keep turning pages until I finished it, far into the night. Was it because I'm the same age as Brandon Walker is in the story, and I understand a little too well how this major character feels about finding new purpose in life? Was it because the Strykers came across as all too believable, to someone who knows how Native Americans were treated only a generation or so ago? I'm not sure. I just know that it grabbed me and held me. I found the two previous Walker family books worth reading, but this one I couldn't put down.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer, head of the San Francisco Police Department's homicide division, is out jogging when a house explodes in front of her. She fights her way inside after hearing someone crying, and she carries out a 10-year-old boy who's the only survivor. The subsequent investigation brings in the Deputy Director of Homeland Security, and it also pulls the ""Women's Murder Club"" - as the four friends call themselves - back together in crime solving mode. Lindsay is joined by Claire, a medical examiner; Cindy, a reporter; and Jill, an assistant district attorney. This time, though, something is wrong with Jill. Or has that something been wrong all along, and her friends are only noticing it now?As the case progresses, the mysterious organization that takes responsibility for the bombing commits other murders and makes sure the world knows it deserves the credit. Clues come in via e-mails and instant messages to Cindy at her newspaper. One of the four Women's Murder Club members becomes the very personal target for vengeance by someone killing on behalf of the radical organization. Very personal, also, is Lindsay's possible relationship with the visiting Deputy Director. Is she ready to let someone else into her life, after what happened to the last man she allowed herself to love?This third installment in the series drops some interesting threads, but picks up new ones as the plot weaves Lindsay's personal and professional lives together. The idea of 60s radicals returning to business decades later is an old and tired one, yet it works well in this book because it's approached in a different way. I found the way the plot resolved just a bit contrived, but that wasn't enough to spoil the read. Not by any means.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Diana Ladd Walker and Brandon Walker are about to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary, and their long marriage isn't going through an easy phase just now. Diana's writing career has taken off with the publication of a book co-authored with Andrew Carlisle, the professor and madman who nearly killed her after his release from prison 21 years ago. Carlisle was mentor to Diana's first husband, Gary Ladd, who fathered her son David - now 27 years old, and just graduating from law school in Chicago, where he has lived in quarters provided by his father's wealthy mother. David is on his way home to Arizona now, to his mother and to Brandon Walker, the only father he has ever known. Of Brandon's sons by his first marriage, ex-convict Quentin is estranged from the family; and Tommy disappeared years ago. The couple's only child together is an adopted Native American girl, Lani, who's 16 now and beautiful. But not yet wise enough to recognize the danger is agreeing to pose for painter who has become familiar to her simply by being parked in his RV along Lani's daily route to her summer job - for Lani has no clue the man who seems perfectly all right to her, and who paints such realistic portraits, is Andrew Carlisle's long time cell mate and carefully trained successor. Carlisle died in prison, but Mitch Johnson is out now and bent on carrying out Carlisle's charge where the Walker family is concerned. When Lani disappears, the current sheriff isn't interested in pursuing the case any sooner than he has to - which means waiting 24 hours and even then starting with a simple missing person report. Brandon Walker, who used to be sheriff until he lost the most recent election, knows his daughter's disappearance needs to be investigated vigorously and immediately. So he starts calling in his markers from people who owe him, and as he works he becomes more and more convinced that Lani's vanishing is connected to the book - the evil book, in Brandon's opinion as well as that of local medicine man ""Fat Crack"" Ortiz - that Diana wrote with Andrew Carlisle.Fast paced and creepy, this is definitely a novel of suspense rather than a mystery. We readers know from the start who the villain is and what's motivating him. What we don't know is who will survive, or how. I found the flashbacks awkward to follow at times, but otherwise the structure worked well. I'll be interested to read the two succeeding books in this series, since these characters' stories definitely aren't over at this novel's end.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Inspector Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco Police Department hasn't seen anything worse, and she's seen a lot in her career so far.  The killer came to the newly married couple's hotel room door, got inside on a ruse, and stabbed the groom to death before first stabbing and then violating the bride.  Boxer comes to the crime scene from a medical appointment at which her doctor tells her that she's ill with a potentially fatal blood disease.  As she pursues the case, and other newly married couples die in different cities around the country, Boxer struggles with treatment and with the knowledge that her illness may kill her.  She shares that knowledge reluctantly with three other women.  First there's the medical examiner who has long been her best friend; then a young reporter whom she's just met; and then a driven, brilliant assistant district attorney, someone Boxer has known for some time but to whom she's never before been close. The foursome works the case together, and they nickname themselves the Women's Murder Club.  Meanwhile, the new partner who's assigned to Boxer temporarily - and much against her will - turns out to be someone she just may be able to love, which she isn't willing to do if she can help it.  Partly because of the diagnosis hanging over her head, and partly because of the divorce from which she has yet to recover.I suppose that reviewers who claim the women are stereotypes may have a point, but for some reason I wasn't bothered.  I liked Lindsay Boxer and found her response to her personal situation realistic for the character as she's written.  The mystery ended with a nasty twist, one that I didn't really see coming even though I knew something still wasn't right.

"San Francisco detective Lindsay Boxer returns to work after both medical issues and a serious personal loss, newly promoted to lieutenant and head of the homicide division. Her first case in that capacity feels close to home. The apparently random shooting of a little black girl is followed by the staged suicide of a black woman, and Boxer learns that both the girl's uncle and the woman's dead husband were San Francisco cops. And so the pattern continues, with Boxer's existence becoming complicated off duty by her father - former cop Marty Boxer - coming back into her life many years after he disappeared from it. What does he want from her now? Is it a relatively simple matter of an aging man searching for redemption, or is his reappearance connected to the case?Once again Lindsay Boxer calls on her three friends, a medical examiner, a reporter, and an assistant district attorney, to help her solve a dangerous and convoluted puzzle. The Women's Murder Club, as they've nicknamed themselves, is back in business. And someone wants at least one of them dead.This second book in a series moves along smartly, and each of its main characters has a very personal stake in the case's outcome. A good, solid mystery, with a protagonist who's flawed yet easy to care about. Definitely, I want to keep reading about Lindsay Boxer and her three friends.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Diana Ladd's life has been in limbo ever since her husband, creative writing graduate student Gary Ladd, committed suicide rather than face murder charges along with his professor, Andrew Carlisle. The pair stood accused of the torture killing of a young Indian woman. Carlisle was convicted, and he's been a model prisoner. Now he's out - released without any word to Diana, or to the victim's grandmother, either. That grandmother, Rita Antone (who was known in her girlhood as Dancing Quail), has become a beloved member of Diana Ladd's household and a second mother more than nanny to Diana's son, Davy, who is six years old now. Diana found out she was pregnant after Gary's death, so Davy did not know his father. But he's still on Andrew Carlisle's target list. Within two days of Carlisle's release, the body count stands at two; and the all too sane appearing madman finds it laughably easy to discover the current address of the three people he most wants to kill. But only after reducing Diana Ladd to abject and total submission.According to author Jance, this re-write of her first novel is her favorite among her works. It was published long after her J.P. Beaumont series made her a favorite with readers, and I am glad I didn't read it first. Had I not already been familiar with her writing, I might not have kept reading until this one pulled me in. It did that, but not at first; and that's because the characters seemed so unpleasant. It took awhile for me to get to know them well enough to start caring. Once I did get involved in the story, though, I had trouble putting it down. I particularly liked the way Jance handled the book's climax (which is violent and cathartic, indeed).

"J.P. ""Beau"" Beaumont, retired from the Seattle Police Department and now a member of the Attorney General of Washington's special homicide investigation unit, must find the person who gunned down a former (and wrongly convicted) prisoner when the man opened the door to his mother's home and was met with a fatal bullet. Beau's partner (both as an investigator and in the romantic sense), Melissa ""Mel"" Soames, must be kept in ignorance of what he's doing because that is the AG's personal order. Mel has her own case, attempting to tie cold murder investigations to missing persons. She quickly discovers that an unexplained number of released former prisoners are dying as they become murder victims. Is Beau's man, wrongly convicted though he was, one of those? It's difficult for him to keep what he is working on secret from Mel, whom he loves. For a time he uses being on bereavement leave to cover his activities, after his grandmother dies and he's willingly tasked with helping her second husband - who also happens to be Beau's AA sponsor - get through the loss. But with two veteran cops both living and working together, it's inevitable for their cases to come together.I'm so glad author Jance found a way to give Beau a new life after his long career with the Seattle PD hit its breaking point. Unconventional has always been the word for Beau; and in the AG's special unit, he can do what he does best without being boxed in. He can also work with the woman he's come to love so deeply, which certainly would not be possible anywhere else. I enjoyed the way the three cases in which Beau and Mel are involved here play out, and as always Beau's personal life sees developments, too. Plot and character drive each other.

"He's the grandson of the ""First Gentleman"" of Washington State. Josh lives in the Governor's Mansion, but his difficult background - including time spent in foster care - makes him an all too natural target for harassment from his supposed peers. How do the Governor's daughters, one older than Josh and the other younger, feel about this relative by their mother's marriage who lives with them but holds himself aloof? And where did the snuff film come from, that's found on his cell phone? By the time Josh commits suicide, leaving a note about not being able to ""take it"" anymore, Attorney General Ross Connors has already assigned two special investigators - retired Seattle P.D. detective J.P. ""Beau"" Beaumont and Beau's wife and working partner, Melissa ""Mel"" Soames - to the case. What began as an attempt to find out the source of the cell phone file and the identity of the apparent murder victim turns into a search for the causes of Josh's despair. For although his own hands knotted his grandfather's ties into the rope and he stepped off the chair by himself, someone is responsible for his death nevertheless.I figured out the mystery just about when I suspect the author meant for me to figure it out, and doing so only made the resolution of the story more enjoyable. Jance has noted somewhere - her website, I think? - that the difference between a mystery and a novel of suspense is that a mystery solves a puzzle, while a novel of suspense examines good and evil. The latter description fits this book perfectly. Intriguing, gritty, and difficult to put down.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"J.P. ""Beau"" Beaumont has retired from the Seattle Police Department, but he's still a detective. He now works for the Attorney General's Special Homicide Investigation Team (yes, that is exactly the acronym). When the AG himself assigns Beau to a repressed memories case, the seasoned investigator doesn't think much of the idea until he talks with the hypnotherapist and patient involved. ""Freddy Mac"" and Sister Mary Katherine, a mother superior who used to be called Bonnie Jean Dunleavy, were both Beau's high school classmates. Sister Mary Katherine has been experiencing screaming nightmares that wake the whole convent, and it looks as if they're due to the surfacing of memories she has kept buried for over 50 years. Since, as a small child of four or five years old, Bonnie Jean witnessed a murder. One that remains unsolved.Meanwhile, Beau's best friend and former partner - paraplegic Ron Peters, who's become second in command of Seattle PD's Internal Affairs Division - wants to plead guilty to the murder of his ex-wife. Someone stabbed Rosemary Peters to death soon after she filed a petition to gain full custody of her younger daughter by Ron, Heather. The older girl, Tracy, is too close to 18 for such a suit to work; but Heather isn't yet 15 years old. Rosemary's death ends the threat of Heather being forced to leave the only parents she has known - Ron and his second wife, Amy - and her sister and small half-brother. But will Ron and Amy's marriage survive this crisis, on top of the one already in progress thanks to Amy's difficult older sister taking up residence in their home and showing no intention of leaving?Beau is in top form here, as being ordered away from the case doesn't stop him from acting as a good friend to Ron and a good ""uncle"" to the two girls he's known since they were small and who are almost as dear to him as his own grown children. His initial disgust at the whole idea of hypnotherapy and recovered memories gives way to belief as the evidence mounts up, thanks to his determined pursuit - a pursuit that defies efforts of people still living to cover up what happened 50 years ago. Despite his determination never to work with a partner again, Beau also has a new one here: Melissa ""Mel"" Soames, a colleague who may be turning into something far more personal.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"Retired Seattle detective J.P. ""Beau"" Beaumont has a job offer on the table, from the Attorney General of Washington for a position on his elite homicide investigation squad. Beau may well accept that offer; but first he's agreed to go with his grandmother, Beverly, on her honeymoon. Beverly has married Lars Jenssen, Beau's AA sponsor, following the death of Beau's grandfather. The elderly lovers both think it wise to have a younger relative along on their Alaskan cruise, in case either should need help. Beau has always been a terrible sailor, but Beverly insists she has just the right remedy for seasickness. Which turns out to work, to Beau's agreeable amazement; and that's a good thing, since he soon finds himself working a case even though he's no longer employed. He just does not know how to stop being a detective, which means that fellow passenger Margaret Featherstone's disappearance sends him into investigation mode. The same thing happens a bit later in the story, when an Alzheimer's patient named Mike Conyers is pushed off the rear deck of a sightseeing train just as it enters a tunnel.Transitions are tough in fictional life as well as in the real version. Beau is making the one from active duty with the Seattle Police Department into retirement, which may or may not be something he wants at this point in his life; and Beverly and Lars Jenssen are making the transition from being widow and widower to being wife and husband. Neither transition avoids bumps in the road. I found the story a change of pace for one of my favorite fictional detectives, although the two plots didn't come together quite as smoothly as in some other books in the series. As for Beverly and Lars - they're a delight. Both together, and separately.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"It looks like a simple case of an old woman smoking in bed, setting her house on fire, and dying as a result. Things start to look different, though, when a search of the garage turns up a refrigerator stuffed with $300,000 in cash. Soon Detectives J.P. ""Beau"" Beaumont and Sue Danielson are investigating a case of murder, with arson as the cause of death and blackmail as the likely motive. They're also trying to solve the mystery presented by human bones found in a Seattle park, being used by a role-playing group in a most bizarre and disrespectful fashion. The bones may belong to a long dead Native American shaman; and if so, a visitor from the tribe tells Beau, everyone who has handled them is in serious danger. Meanwhile, Captain Powell's sudden retirement due to his wife's terminal illness places Beau's nemesis - Detective Paul Kramer - in the squad commander's chair. Temporarily, at least; and it may well become permanent.This book's events take Beau to a major turning point in his life. He's grieving for his former wife, Karen, who recently died of cancer; and he's worried about Sue Danielson, whose abusive ex-husband has resurfaced with a demand that she let him take their two sons (whom he has failed to support and failed even to contact for some years now) to Disneyland. Beau wonders what Richie Danielson will do when Sue puts her foot down, and refuses to let the boys miss several days of school because their father insists he can't schedule the trip during their vacation.Things come together explosively, with Beau making a major decision as a result. This decision sends his life in new directions both personally and professionally. I found BREACH OF DUTY riveting.--Reviewed by Nina M.

"J.P. ""Beau"" Beaumont, Seattle homicide detective, has little difficulty learning the identity of the ""floater"" found underneath a pier on New Year's Day. No one's sorry the biotech executive is dead, and one person - an eccentric, wealthy, well-connected elderly lady - confesses to the murder, in a most public (and therefore embarrassing, since she's lying) manner. Nevertheless it proves to be a complicated investigation, and it gets more so when Beau visits the dead man's apartment and finds the man's estranged wife dead inside it. Who actually did the deed, or deeds (assuming the same person killed both husband and wife)? Who was the mysterious ""wheelchair woman"" shadowing the executive in the days and nights before he died? Those are just a few of the questions Beau needs to answer, and having Detective Paul Kramer - his nemesis - also assigned to the case doesn't help one bit.One of the things I love about J.A. Jance is how her characters change due to events in their lives, and ""Beau"" does a lot of changing in this book. The recovering alcoholic suffers a relapse, for one thing; and for another, he has to face the death of his first wife, who remains the mother of his children and a major player in his history despite the decade since their divorce. New characters, his widowed grandmother and his crusty and elderly AA sponsor, begin playing larger roles in his life here, too. The mystery is just fine, but Beau is what makes the whole thing work.

"It's been a long time since Seattle homicide detective J.P. ""Beau"" Beaumont was a high school kid, but he hasn't forgotten the people of the neighborhood where his single mother raised him. Ballard is no longer quite the same enclave of Norwegian fishermen and their families, but the case to which he's currently assigned brings him back in contact with people he once knew. They include a former high school cheerleader who's become a widow thanks to that case, when someone handcuffed her husband to a table aboard his fishing boat and set the boat on fire after torturing him.Beau has a new partner here, Detective Sue Danielson, and he's in recovery from alcoholism. The trail the two detectives follow leads a long way back, all the way to World War II and its aftermath. Who was the murdered man, actually? Did even his wife really know that, or will what Beau finds out come as news to her? And what kind of danger does their young adult daughter face, now that death has brought her home after several years of estrangement?Forcing Beau to look back into his past, at himself as a teenaged boy, works well here for two reasons. First, he's at the stage of alcoholism recovery where looking into the past makes sense; and second, Sue Danielson is a single mother struggling with a difficult teenaged son of her own. The mystery interested me even more than usual because of its World War II background. I've been fascinated by that time and place in history since my early teens, and Jance has done her homework here. Top notch!--Reviewed by Nina M.

The wrappers are good quality, heavy duty paper with crisp, clear printing.But, I'm kind of struggling with whether or not I would actually buy this kit and keep it around for emergency gift-giving situations. I mean, for one thing, me having chocolate around without eating it is very, well, not me at all. It would be a struggle. And I'm not sure I see myself handing someone a wrapped chocolate bar and saying, ""Happy birthday,"" or ""Congratulations.""

"This cushion does make your chair feel sort of like sitting on a balance ball. It does provide the ""active seat"" that the product description claims and it does make you use your core muscles if you sit up straight balanced over the center of the cushion.The cushion is made of sturdy material and I think it will old up well. It came already inflated. It was too firm for me and I found it uncomfortable to sit on for more than 5-10 minutes. But, after I let a bit of air out, I found it much more comfortable. But, it's still not as comfortable to sit on as an exercise ball. I think that's because with the exercise ball, you can roll it around a little bit to relieve pressure points. With this cushion in your chair, you can't really reposition your seat. Also, I did not like sitting on the knobby side. I flipped it over to the smooth side and liked that better.If you can't sit on an exercise ball at work, this cushion will give you some of the benefits.

"First, I want to comment on all the Battlestar Galactica fanboys reviews blasting this novel for ""ripping off"" Battlestar Galactica. Apparently none of these BG fans are old enough to remember the fuss over the original BG ""ripping off"" Star Wars.  When BG first came out, Universal Studios was sued by 20th Century Fox for stealing ideas from Star Wars. Universal countersued, claiming that Star Wars stole ideas from Silent Running and Buck Rogers. And Isaac Asimov was quoted as saying ""Star Wars was fun and I enjoyed it. But Battlestar Galactica was Star Wars all over again and I couldn't enjoy it without amnesia."" (Quote courtesy of Google and Wikipedia)So yeah, maybe this book does ""borrow"" a few ideas from past science fiction novels/movies/TV shows. So what? It's not the first and won't be the last. And maybe a few things could be considered ""paying homage,"" rather than ""ripping off.""Now, on to what really matters: is this book any good? I say ""Yes. Yes, it is.""

I was not sure I was going to bother reading the whole book. But, once the aliens showed up in our Solar System, the story really got rolling and I was hooked.

The only compliment that I can pay the book is that the author did do a good job of describing the setting and some of the issues facing Israelis and Palestinians.Despite the fact that this should be a gripping thriller, there was never a moment when I had trouble putting the book down to go do something else. This was one of the slowest moving ""fast paced"" books I've ever read. Even events that passed in nearly the blink of an eye or would have been described by a person on the scene as ""frenzied"" slowed, on the pages, to a crawl.The main character is a bit of a superhero, which isn't, in itself, a big negative for me, but she, and all the other characters were one-dimensional. And to make things worse, most of the characters seemed bent on doing things that made little sense.Finally, the book contained too many points of annoyance for me to really enjoy it. For example, the main character, Raisa Jordan, makes her first appearance in Chapter 4. But, the author doesn't explain who she is! If I hadn't read the book jacket, which tells you that Jordan is an agent for the US Diplomatic Security Service, I wouldn't have known who she worked for.This is the author's first book and it seems to be setting the stage for additional books featuring Raisa Jordan.

"When I took this watch out of the box, I was taken aback by the size. This watch is huge, as you can see from the picture of this watch and my regular watch, side-by-side on my wrist. The case is large and surprisingly thick. The band is wide and long.  I had to remove three of the links in the band and I am by no means a petite or small-boned individual. It is also really heavy, to the point of being somewhat bothersome. Due to the size and the fact that the watch is not particularly feminine in appearance, I was initially convinced that I had been sent a men's watch by mistake. But, a friend later assured me that ""big"" is the fashion for women's watches right now and that this watch was very likely indeed a women's watch.That aside, this is a nice watch. The quality seems good. It is very attractive and the black face nicely sets off the white hands, which also glow in the dark. The band is sturdy and the clasp has a safety latch that requires two steps to get it open, so you don't have to worry about it accidentally popping open - a good thing given the heavy weight of the watch. The bezel is fixed, so it's just there for appearances. I would say this watch is as much fashion accessory as it is time piece.The watch comes in a nice box and is presented well in the box, so it would make a nice gift - just maybe not the best choice for a petite woman or younger girl.I don't think I will wear this watch much because of the size and weight.

"Protocol Zero is a ""turn your brain off"" fast snowmobile dash across the Arctic tundra. Once it gets going, the story zips along at top speed, as Marine Colonel Dr. Joe Rush tries to figure out if a series of deaths are due to a natural epidemic or are murders in which the murder weapon is a virus. And, if the first, how the epidemic got started or, if the second, who is behind the deaths and why.The first part of the book was marred by the time spent on the relationship between Joe and his fiancee, Karen, which made me want to send each of them to their rooms to sit time out. I was having flashbacks to middle/high school. And in the end, none of it really mattered, so I was tortured for nothing.The biggest problem with this book, for me, is that after I finished it and got off the snowmobile ride, I realized that none of it made any sense. And the more I thought about it, the less sense it made and the more it annoyed me.I like the basic premise of this series. I like Joe and his buddy, Eddie. I liked the first book in the series. If the author writes a third book, I will read it. But, if the third has the same problems that Protocol Zero had, then I'm done.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10CZWEPO6EDS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425276341#wasThisHelpful","R10CZWEPO6EDS8","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This soup isn't bad, with lots of noodles and big chunks of carrot, but the spices used in the preparation are just not to my liking. The soup had a slight taste that I associate with the poultry seasoning my Mom uses in the dressing at Thanksgiving and it had a bit too much ""bite"" for my tastes (too much black pepper?).I like the packaging. It's definitely tough - the container was shipped to me via UPS in a barely padded envelope. I couldn't believe it survived intact. It is also easy to open if you follow the directions, although I admit it took me a moment to figure out exactly what corners I was supposed to pinch together.The container is supposed to be two servings. I ate the whole thing for lunch, with a little broth left over for the dog, and was satisfied - not overfull, but I didn't need anything else with it.

"The appearance of this chair is quite striking. Half the people in my office stopped to look at it and most sat down to try it out. Unfortunately, it is a classic example of a great concept with poor execution.On the plus side, the slightly stretchy web makes a very comfortable surface upon which to sit and lean. The pneumatic adjustment allows the chair back to recline and come forward easily and smoothly. And with the open webbing, the chair is much cooler than a regular office chair. I never noticed how my regular chair heats up until I sat in this one for comparison. Another thing I appreciated is that the seat of the chair is short enough that it doesn't dig into the back of my knee when I sit all the way back in the chair - with my relatively short legs this is a common problem in chairs, sofas, car seats...However, this chair has a fatal flaw that makes it useless to me as an office chair. Even with the chair raised as high as it will go, it is not high enough for me to comfortably use my computer keyboard. Now, my keyboard does sit about 4 inches higher than on a typical office desk with a keyboard drawer that hangs below the desk surface, but my current generic office chair raises up high enough for me to type comfortably without even being fully raised. This chair doesn't even come close.My other major complaint about the chair is that the lumbar support is no where near the lumbar area of my back. In order to sit comfortably in the chair for any length of time, I had to put a lumbar support pillow above the lumbar support on the chair, which kind of defeats the purpose of the stretchy web straps. I could get the lumbar support into the right spot be reclining the chair back, but by the time it hit the right spot, I was in ""put your feet up and watch TV"" position, not ""work at your desk"" position.I also don't like the way the arm rests swivel so easily. It seems like every time I put my hands on the arm rests for any reason, they swivel out. Not a big deal, but a minor annoyance.Assembly of the chair is well within the capabilities of the average person, but just difficult enough to be annoying. It's easier with two people.This chair was a disappointment. I really like the way it looks and I like the stretchy web seat and back. But, I'm not going to be able to use it as a desk chair.Edited to add that 5 other people in my office have now tried this chair and it has yet to find a permanent home. Most people had the same complaint I did - it doesn't raise up high enough to type comfortably. One said it didn't sit upright enough for a work chair.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H6H2Y2RND8IR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZY8DOCY#wasThisHelpful","R3H6H2Y2RND8IR","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have wood floors throughout the house, except in the bathroom. I also have a cat and a dog, so lots of hair. I use a vacuum for serious floor sweeping and rely on a regular dry Swiffer for in-between sweeping, mostly to pick up pet hair. This ""Sweep and Trap"" sweeper works well for this purpose, better, in fact, than the plain old Swiffer because the hair balls get caught in the ""trap"" instead of simply being pushed around the floor.This sweeper is not good at picking up bigger debris from the floor. However, it does a great job of picking up crumbs and dust along with the pet hair. The tray of the trap is not very deep and it is easy to tip over when trying to remove it for emptying. You have to pay attention to what you're doing and hold the sweeper upright and still while removing the tray.I like this floor sweeper. It works better than the plain dry Swiffer for my purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REBTGMNV4NTQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBP7GPM#wasThisHelpful","REBTGMNV4NTQU","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic set for the occasional recreational snorkeler.Fins: I wear women's shoe size 7.5-8. I selected size L/XL because I wanted fins big enough to fit over neoprene booties. The L/XL fit well with my booties and were comfortable. The straps are very easy to adjust, both tightening and releasing. However, if you really need size L/XL to fit your feet and you have wide feet, you might find these to be a bit of a narrow fit. I like the overall size of these fins - enough fin to be useful, but not so much that it's awkward to manage.Snorkel: I love the dry top and the purge valve makes it easy to get rid of any water that does leak in. The flexible neck is softer and more flexible than any of the other snorkels I own. I also really like the quick release mask attachment - one the snorkel has been attached to the mask, all you have to do is press the quick release button and the snorkel slides loose from the mask. My only dislike is that the mouthpiece itself is quite small and very flexible. I'm used to using a snorkel with a more substantial mouthpiece and this one didn't feel a secure in my mouth. This is probably something that isn't going to bother anyone who hasn't already formed an attachment to a different snorkel and may even be an advantage for someone who is petite and has a smaller face and mouth.Mask: I have kind of a round, broad face and this mask fit me well, forming a comfortable and effective seal. The visibility is good and the silicone around the mask is softer and more flexible than either of the two masks we already have. It is comfortable to wear and the strap is extremely easy to adjust - the easiest of any mask I've ever used. I don't really love that the silicone of the mask is black. I have another mask that is similar in design but has clear silicone and I prefer the ""view"" from that one.Mesh Bag: The mesh bag is really handy for carrying this set to the beach. The string handle is long enough to toss the bag over your shoulder, freeing your hands for coolers and beach chairs. The holes in the mesh are big enough that the sand easily falls out.I highly recommend this snorkeling set for people who like to do a little snorkeling while on vacation or coastal dwellers who like to keep a spare set of gear on hand for company.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDSK8IVIPSA2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLE3GMA#wasThisHelpful","RDSK8IVIPSA2W","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case is very good for what it is. It is well made, sturdy, and sleek. It is great for storing your small laptop and for carrying it to a meeting or down to your local free wifi coffee shop.However, I do think the manufacturer's touting of the case's ""thick interior padding"" and ""hard EVA shell"" is a little overblown. The padding isn't that thick and the shell isn't that hard. Yes, it will likely protect your laptop against minor dings (a valuable quality) and help keep it clean (unless, like me, you tend to eat a muffin at the coffee shop while surfing the internet), but I'm not sure it's much more protective than the padded laptop pocket inside my daypack.The two drawbacks to this case for me are the carrying handle and the lack of room to take along the cord.  The long strap that goes over your shoulder is fine, but the only thing to grab if you want to carry the case in your hand is a web strip along the back. I find it to be very awkward to hold. I do understand the design choice, because foregoing a more traditional handle keeps the case trim and sleek, so it may be perceived as a positive by some users.In addition, the case is just big enough to carry my 11.6 inch laptop. There is no room inside for the cord. My little chromebook has great battery life (my little Windows laptop, not so much) and there is no need for the cord if I'm just going to be using it for a few hours at a meeting. However, it causes me some anxiety to go off without the cord and it kind of defeats the purpose to carry an additional bag for the cord. Yeah, that's my own personal hangup, but there it is.  This also reduces the usefulness of the case for storing your small laptop at home because you can't keep the cord with the laptop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV8T634PLJG1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKN4B36#wasThisHelpful","RV8T634PLJG1I","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product has exactly the same active ingredients as Frontline Plus for cats, so it should be equally effective. The fleas aren't very active right now, though, so I can't really speak to the product's effectiveness.I normally use Frontline, but really dislike the Frontline packaging. With Frontline, the small container that holds the liquid is sealed inside another layer of packaging. You cut the outer package open, remove the inner container, then snap the top back to dispense the liquid.

"How much do I like this mattress? Enough to buy one for myself. I got this mattress for the twin bed in the guest room, where we were trying to compensate for an uncomfortable mattress with not just one, but two mattress toppers. My Mom slept on this new mattress for a week and I tried it out for two nights. We both loved it and slept very well on it. I usually wake up multiple times during the night to roll over or adjust the pillow, or rearrange the covers. With this mattress, I found that I slept longer and woke less frequently. I'm going to order one for my bed.This twin size mattress came in a box small enough to fit in the front seat of my truck. Because I had already read some reviews that commented about an odor when the packaging was opened, I took it out to the workshop and let it inflate and air out there for a couple of days. By the time I brought it in the house, the mattress itself still had a faint chemical odor, but once we put the mattress cover and sheet on it, you couldn't smell anything.With respect to the firmness of the mattress, I don't think you can use the terms ""firm"" and ""soft"" with memory foam mattresses in the same way you do with a regular innerspring mattress. I prefer a soft mattress, as does my Mom. But, while this mattress feels firm when you first lay down on it, you sort of settle in to the memory foam as you lay on it and I found it to be very comfortable, with none of the morning aches and pains I feel when I sleep on a firm mattress.Note that, at 6 inches, this mattress will sit much lower than something like a pillow-top mattress.

"Anonymous Soldiers is a scholarly account of the role of terrorism and terrorist organizations in the establishment of Israel.  It is meticulously researched, exhaustively referenced, remarkably even-handed, and impressively detailed. The latter is evidenced by the fact that well over half of the book is devoted to just the last three years of the struggle.In content, Anonymous Soldiers focuses narrowly on the activities of the two Jewish terrorist organizations, Irgun and Lehi, as an example of the impact a dedicated campaign of terrorism can have on a government's actions and policies. It is not a comprehensive history and the author makes clear in the preface that that was not his intention. I see this book as an essential addition to the libraries of serious scholars of either the history of Israel or the use of terrorism as a political tool. I found the book to be impressive, educational, and thought-provoking.With respect to my personal experience reading this book, I found it to be much more readable than I expected (feared?) it would be. I frequently found myself engrossed in the unfolding events. At times it was like watching a slow-motion train wreck - so many misunderstandings, missteps, and missed opportunities among the British, Arabs, and Jews in Palestine. However...somewhere around the 2/3 point, I got really bogged down. The level of detail began to become somewhat oppressive. I had to take a week off and come back to finish it. I think this book is best for readers who have a high level of interest in the subject.I dithered between giving this book 4 or 5 stars. As an addition to the body of scholarship on the formation and history of Israel, I think it warrants 5 stars. However, a rating of 4 stars better represents my personal reading experience.

"I have mixed feelings about this microwave. I was really excited to be offered the opportunity to review it because, in my small kitchen, I have room for one, and only one, counter top appliance. I kept my microwave (and then put a toaster on top of it) but there are times that I really miss my convection/toaster oven. This unit offers multiple cooking modes and the possibility of getting my microwave, toaster oven, and convection oven all in one.I have thus far baked cookies using the convection oven setting, cooked frozen, breaded mushrooms using the SlimFry setting, and heated up leftovers and water for tea using the microwave setting. I've also experimented with, but haven't completely cooked anything, with most of the other modes of operation. I have been fairly underwhelmed by this ""Jack of all trades, master of none"" unit. Yes, it can bake cookies, but can it do so better and faster than my regular oven? Yes, I can make crispy breaded mushrooms with SlimFry, but is it better than just using my oven to bake them? I'm inclined to say, ""No."" I haven't yet decided whether or not to allow it to take up permanent residence in my kitchen.Things you need to know if you are thinking about buying this convection microwave:The instruction book is inadequate, at best. If you aren't comfortable with the concepts of ""cook it until it's done"" and ""let's put that pan in there and see what happens,"" then you will not like this unit. The book also contains some contradictory information (e.g.telling you not to use metal in the microwave, but instructing you to use a metal rack and crisping pan for the SlimFry mode, even though it says that SlimFry is a combo of the grill, convection, and microwave modes).For some of the cooking modes, you cannot select a cooking time, just a food type, which is associated with a preset cooking time (and you don't know what that time is until after you select the food type). For example, when I used SlimFry to cook my mushrooms, I used the ""frozen potato croquettes"" preset because it seemed closest in food type (back to that inadequate instruction book) and it set a cooking time for me. I had to set my regular timer to check on them at intervals and ended up pulling them out about 2 minutes before the end of the preset time because they were definitely done.The ""grill"" mode should more properly be called a ""broil"" mode. A heating element in the top of the oven is used for ""grilling."" I did not grill (broil) anything because 1. it just seemed to me like it would create a huge mess inside the oven and 2. I wouldn't broil without an exhaust fan over top, and the only exhaust fan I've got in my kitchen is over the stove.This thing gets hot on the outside - really hot - when you use the convection oven, SlimFry, and grill modes (or any combo mode that uses convection or grill modes). You need to set it somewhere with plenty of clearance around it.It isn't a true toaster oven because it doesn't have top and bottom heating elements. You can toast bread in it, but you'll have to toast it one side at a time.The convection oven is supposed to bake faster than a regular oven. It doesn't. My sugar cookies came out perfectly, though. Nice and crispy, just the way I like them.The microwave works well.The cord is really short. You need to find a spot to put it where it is close to an outlet or use a heavy duty extension cord with a three-prong plug.Operation is not intuitive - prepare to keep the instruction book handy for a while.Would I recommend this counter top convection microwave? I'll give a qualified yes, because I can see some circumstances where this multi-purpose oven would be useful. If, for example, you have a tiny studio apartment that doesn't have an oven and you only have room for one counter top appliance. Or maybe an office break room, where the primary use would be as a microwave, but other cooking modes might be useful once in a while (hey, who doesn't occasionally have the urge to make some ready-to-bake chocolate chip cookies on a bad day at work?).However, for the average kitchen, I think you are better off sticking with a regular microwave, toaster, and regular oven.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRS5AGL10DYU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NN136NQ#wasThisHelpful","RRS5AGL10DYU3","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This very short book is a collection of 12 different essays about the Civil War, 10 of which have appeared in other publications in the past. The individual essays are all quite good and cover a range of topics. I learned quite a bit and have a whole new respect for Abraham Lincoln and a much deeper understanding of the magnitude of the tragedy that was his assassination. The quality of the individual essays is why I rated this book 4 stars. I especially like Chapter 1, an essay that addressed the concepts of negative and positive liberty.However, I am much more interested in the ""Why the Civil War Still Matters"" part of the book's title than the ""The War That Forged a Nation"" part and in that respect, this book was a disappointment. In my opinion, only 3 (4 in a stretch) chapters of the book explicitly address ""why the Civil War still matters."" Any efforts to tie the other 9 chapters into this theme fall squarely on the shoulders of the reader. I would have been much happier if the author had either included a few extra paragraphs in each essay to tie them into this overall theme or penned a 13th essay in which the contributions of the individual essays were all pulled together in a discussion of why the Civil War still matters.I highly recommend this collection of essays to anyone who is interested in the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln. A lot of information is contained within this small volume. And, for students of Civil War history, two of the essays are devoted to countering the claims made by some other Civil War historians. However, if, like me, you are more interested in current political and sociological issues and this book caught your interest because of title's ""Why the Civil War Still Matters,"" then you will likely not find this book particularly satisfying, although a couple of the individual essays are excellent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MFQLO2VHNAZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199375771#wasThisHelpful","R1MFQLO2VHNAZC","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"White Plague is a medical mystery, espionage thriller, military novel set almost entirely in the Arctic. The book also gives us a dose of history and a bit about climate change. There is plenty of action and the author does a great job of describing the arctic environment. The plot twists and turns. I did not figure everything out in advance and the book managed to surprise me a time or two, which I really appreciated.In general, character development is good, although better for some than for others. My initial response to Joe Rush, the main character, was guarded - I wasn't entirely sure I was going to like this guy. But, I came to appreciate him as the story went on and look forward to future Joe Rush novels. One aspect that I did like with respect to the characters was that the author was willing to let them be complicated. Few of the characters were one dimensional ""good guys"" or ""bad guys.""The book was not perfect. I had a few quibbles with the science (e.g. chemical weapons are not the same thing as bioweapons, a vaccine is not a cure). The flashbacks were sometimes kind of clunky. But, for me, one of the big factors in deciding whether or not to give a book 5 stars is the ""stay up late on a work night"" factor. For White Plague, I stayed up late and on New Year's Day, I kept sneaking in to read another chapter or two. So, in spite of the few weakness, I really did love this book and can't wait to read more in the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2407HQL56BP1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425276325#wasThisHelpful","R2407HQL56BP1P","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used nothing but Dove soap for years. Like my regular Dove, this Go Fresh Revitalize Bar lathers well, even in my hard water, doesn't dry my skin, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.So, if this soap performs just like similar Dove bar soaps, the decision to purchase this particular one will likely be based on scent. In my household, we fall into two camps in the scent: love it and hate it. I don't like strong scents. I prefer my soaps and lotions to be light and fruity and I found the scent of this soap to be overpowering and slightly unpleasant, close to veering into industrial air freshener territory. My Mom, on the other hand, prefers stronger scents in her lotions and perfumes and she loved the scent of this soap.Considering the soap aspect alone, this mandarin and tiare flower Go Fresh Revitalize Bar is great soap. If you like the other Dove soaps, you will like this one - unless you are sensitive to or dislike strong scents. If you are, then stay away from this soap.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QB6UUEZNJ7IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q70QYW0#wasThisHelpful","R2QB6UUEZNJ7IW","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good things:The big handles make it easier to hold and push down to cut through fruits and vegetables. I've had a cheaper apple corer-slicer that was really hard to push though the apple because the handles weren't big enough to really get a grip on it.The interchangeable blades give you two options without having to buy two separate cutters.It works...mostly.Bad things:The blades are slightly recessed in the ring, which means that it doesn't cut cleanly all the way down to the cutting board. With the apple corer/slicer, it's not a huge deal because you can just pull the cutter  up off the apple and pull the slices apart. But, with the vegetable blade, the potato slices remain stuck in the blade. The easiest and safest way to deal with this that I could figure out was to take my measuring cup and push the bottom of the potato up into the blade so the blade cut all the way through. I still had to pull the slices out the top, but it was more manageable that way. Still kind of a pain, though.These blades are sharp. Really sharp. You cannot handle this gadget casually. You have to be careful and on your guard every time you handle it. My Mom cut herself twice in the space of two days - once washing it and once putting it in the cupboard. The second time was a pretty significant cut. There has to be a way to design something like this to reduce the likelihood of cutting yourself.Other comments:Perhaps I'm just not sufficiently coordinated, but I had to cut the end off the potato to get a flat end to make it stand up so I could slice it without tipping (possibly my fear of getting my fingers too close to the blades was affecting my slicing technique).In case I haven't yet made this point clear, the blades on this cutter are really sharp and very easy to cut yourself on. Honestly, I was ready to throw it in the trash after the second time my Mom cut herself. I'm storing it in a plastic container so no one reaches in the cupboard and accidentally touches the blades.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZQ6L5TIYDPVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPXKN3W#wasThisHelpful","RZQ6L5TIYDPVX","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blue Warrior, the second Troy Pearce novel, is both better and worse than Drone, the first book in the series. Better, because I didn't notice as much of the uneven writing quality that bothered me while reading Drone. Blue Warrior is more consistent and doesn't have as many eye-rolling moments as I remember Drone having.Worse because the author crammed too much into this book. There were way too many plot threads and I still can't figure out why the author thought some of them were necessary, since the story could have proceeded essentially unchanged without them. The author should have saved some of those good ideas for the next book or two.Overall, though, I liked the book. Like Drone, Blue Warrior is a fast paced techno-thriller with nearly non-stop action. The tech, especially the drone and weapons tech, is fascinating. I also found the computer hacking to be interesting since I just finished reading a on-fiction book on that subject - it's all kind of scary.I don't think it's essential to read Drone before you read Blue Warrior, but I think it would increase your enjoyment of the book if you did. I recommend this book to all fans of the techno-thriller genre, especially if you prefer them heavy on the tech. While there is some character development, the book is really all about the tech and the action, so if you prefer a more character-driven novel, this may not be your best choice.Blue Warrior wasn't quite what I hoped for as a follow-up to Drone, but I will definitely be looking forward to book 3.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NOVVCDCJEJC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167390#wasThisHelpful","R2NOVVCDCJEJC1","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every time my neighbors mow their pasture, mice invade my shed. Mice usually also try to move into the shed a couple of times every winter. So, I was really glad to be offered the opportunity to evaluate this mouse bait station.I really like the design of the bait station and the fact that it is refillable. The bait station has a child-safe screw-off cap. The baits themselves have a hole in the middle. Inside the chamber where the bait is placed, there is a peg. You remove the lid, insert the bait block over the peg, which holds it in place, and then screw the top back on. Mice can enter the trap from both sides.Be aware that the bait station itself is quite large, compared to the disposable single bait stations I have purchased in the past. If you need to put a bait station in a tight space, this bait station is probably not the best choice.Like several other reviewers, I also noticed the odd packaging choice of leaving the bait blocks loose in the resealable bag while the bait station was wrapped in plastic. I think I might have made the opposite choice, wrapping the bait blocks in plastic and leaving the bait station unwrapped in the bag.I can't yet comment on the effectiveness of this bait station. I haven't seen any evidence of mice eating the bait, but I haven't yet seen much evidence of mice making their seasonal move into the shed, either. I will update when I have more to report.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ2M7NJ589Z9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GIEI73O#wasThisHelpful","RJ2M7NJ589Z9T","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These disposable washcloths are indeed unscented, something that is important to me. They are also thick, much thicker than the generic wet wipes I'm currently carrying in my car. And, as advertised, they do not leave any discernible residue behind, nor, to me, do they feel soapy. They are a bit smaller in size than a standard washcloth, but still have a substantial feel. Heating the wipes in the microwave before using does make the washing up experience more pleasant on a cold day.I can think of many situations in which I would find these disposable washcloths handy to have. I usually try to keep a package of wet wipes in the car for spills and sticky fingers associated with snacking and minor cleanups after visits to the park, barn, or beach. I also like to stick a package of disposable wipes in my briefcase for business travel for everything from cleaning off the drop-down tray on the plane to freshening up in the airport restroom after a long flight. These wipes are also substantial enough to do a quick clean up after a lunchtime walk or workout during my work day.I would definitely purchase these wipes to carry in the car, keep in my desk drawer at work (along with the toothbrush/toothpaste and antiperspirant I currently have stashed there), and stick in my briefcase before heading for the airport.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F8ZY8IKMI17K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYRXINI#wasThisHelpful","R1F8ZY8IKMI17K","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't yet comment on the tooth cleaning effectiveness of these treats since we've only been using them a few weeks. But, I can tell you that my dog LOVES these treats. He is always excited to get one and immediately settles down to chew it up.I also like these dog chews because they do not have a strong odor. One of the things I dislike about many dog treats is that they have an overpowering odor of meat and spices. I'm sure that helps make them attractive to the dog, but it bothers me to the point that I'm not a repeat customer for dog treats that turn out to have a strong odor.One thing that I see expressed often in reviews of dog treats is concern over where the treats are made. I checked the Milk Bone web site and found this statement:All Milk-BoneÆ Dog Biscuits and dog treats are produced at our facilities here in the U.S. The majority of ingredients are sourced from the U.S. Like most pet companies, we source a limited amount of minor ingredients, such as important nutritional supplements or preservatives, from other countries due to limited availability in the U.S. We want to assure you that our strict U.S. quality and operations standards apply equally to all of our ingredients, regardless of the country of origin.I would definitely purchase these dog treats in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PQYLXFGAQ2LQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INTTDWG#wasThisHelpful","R2PQYLXFGAQ2LQ","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before you order this product, look at the diagram and installation instructions shown above in the product description, then go take the top off your toilet tanks and make sure your toilet tank looks enough like the one in the diagram to be able to install the device. Mine does not (the connection of the tube to the overflow pipe is different). While I'm sure I could have made it work, just wasn't willing to get in there and start taking things apart.However, that ended up being a good thing, because I took the Kaboom Continuous Clean System in to work and put it on the toilet in my office, where it got a much more rigorous tryout. The tank of my office toilet looks exactly like the one in the diagram and installation instructions and I had no trouble at all installing it. Pull out the existing tubing, hang the cartridge on the back of the tank, attach the two new tubes, insert the cleaning tablets, and it's ready to go.I recommend using a pair of scissors to carefully cut open the wrapper holding the cleaning tablets. If you just grab it and rip it open, like I did, you will generate a little puff of dust, which you will then inhale. It's kind of like sniffing bleach. Not pleasant. Several other reviews have commented on this product leaving their bathroom smelling strongly of bleach/chlorine. I did not find this to be an issue during use. If you take the top off the tank, then yes, it smells quite strongly of chlorine. Also, if you stand right over the toilet when you flush, you can briefly smell it. However, in regular use, I never noticed it much.Now, I'm not willing to use this product instead of regularly cleaning my toilets with a brush and toilet bowl cleaner, but I do think this is a great supplement for between cleanings. I can tell that it's working, though. The toilet I installed it in is an old toilet and it had some blue stains from some previously used toilet bowl cleaner. Within a week or so, I noticed that the blue stains were beginning to lighten up. They are now just a shadow and I hope will disappear entirely over time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q2Z2YZNBX6PK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPEO64G#wasThisHelpful","R1Q2Z2YZNBX6PK","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have not yet read book 1 of this series, Timebound, do not read this book. You will hopelessly confused. If it has been a while since you read Timebound, you might want to read it again before you start Time's Edge. There were a number of times while reading Time's Edge where I was confused because the author assumed that the reader remembered some detail from book 1 that I had forgotten. For example, there were a couple of times when the characters would say, ""we can't do/must do that,"" and I would be pretty sure I remembered that being addressed in book 1, but I couldn't remember exactly what was said so I didn't know why.And speaking of confusion...while reading this book, I was often reminded of one of my favorite Star Trek captains, who once said, ""... the future is the past, the past is the future, it all gives me a headache."" There was a lot - a lot- of hopping back and forth in time. I don't know how some of the characters were able to keep track of what they were doing and when they were doing it.In spite of a few minor complaints, I did enjoy reading this book, especially once Kate and Kiernan got started on their runs to retrieve the lost Chronos keys. I thought the beginning was a little slow, but it definitely got better as it went along. I don't think Time's Edge was quite as good as Timebound, but it is still a good book.

"With respect to content, this book presents an important topic with wide-ranging implications and the author has clearly done a lot of research in order to pull this information together. Individuals, businesses, and governments are all threatened by hackers, who themselves run the gamut from anarchists to criminals to agents of foreign governments (both friend and foe) to agents of our own government. However, while I think understanding the potential for disaster is important, I have to confess that I most appreciated the descriptions of ways in which the cyber skills of the military and businesses were used to effectively combat attackers ranging from insurgents in Iraq to Chinese government hackers.With respect to the writing, I thought the author did a good job of creating a very readable account of a complex subject. I also appreciated the way that the author presented most of the information without passing judgment, leaving me free to pass my own. (I still can't decide exactly how I feel about the NSA.)I thought there was a bit too much repetition in the book, but, on the other hand, this subject is a bit of a tangled web and some repetition may be unavoidable. I did start wishing about 2/3 of the way through the book that I had a big flowchart tacked up on the wall to help me keep track of who was who, who did what, and when they did it. I don't see this as a fault of the writing so much as a by-product of the complex subject.In summary, I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in cyberwarfare and what is going on behind the scenes in cyberspace. However, in spite of the fact that I consider this book to be quite readable, I do agree with the other reviewer who noted that you will need a pretty high level of interest in the topic to stick with it through the entire book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LA7FPROHO93V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544251792#wasThisHelpful","R2LA7FPROHO93V","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Often, when I have the chance to review some brand name product, I like it, but end up going back to my usual cheaper generic version. I don't think that will be the case with these trash bags. The plastic is thick enough to stand up to heavy and oddly shaped trash. Even boxes with sharp corners haven't yet poked any holes in the bags. The scent is perfect. So many scented/odor-control bags have an overwhelming scent to them that I don't like, but these bags' scent is pleasant and mild. They also keep odors associated with the fishy empty cat food cans under control.While I like everything about these bags, it is one particular feature that sold me and will make me go out and purchase them: the stretchy drawstring top. Unlike my usual trash bags, these are both easy to stretch around the top of the trash can and fit snugly once I've got it around the top.I've looked at some of the other reviews in which people have complained about the drawstring breaking. I'm about half way through the box and have not experienced this at all. I will note that I do not use the drawstring to lift the full bag out of the trash can. I tie up the bag while it is still in the can, then grab it by the top of the bag and lift it out, so perhaps that is why I've had no problems with the drawstring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AV71H409BGGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFU6YM4#wasThisHelpful","R2AV71H409BGGG","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The main character, Sonja, is interesting and easy to root for. And, it was a treat to read an action-adventure novel in which the standard strong, silent, tough guy hero was replaced by an equally strong, silent, tough gal heroine.Another thing that I appreciated about The Delta is that the author managed to surprise me several times with an unexpected twist or revelation that, once revealed, made perfect sense (i.e. the good kind of surprise, not the kind that leaves you scratching your head and wondering where that came from).I stayed up late several nights reading this book.

"I've loved most of the previous Jack Reacher books and at least liked the few I didn't love. But, the past couple of books have left me less than fully satisfied, so I was very happy to find myself firmly back in love with Child's work in Personal. That said, Personal was a bit different from most of the previous books due to the introduction of Casey Nice, a rookie agent whose presence leads Reacher to take on the role of mentor. Because of this, Reacher does a little bit more explaining of how and why he does what he does than we usually get.However, in other ways, Personal is classic Reacher. Jack is tough, smart, and supremely pragmatic, not afraid to do whatever needs to be done. As usual, Jack manages to strip away the gray in most any situation, leaving us with the fundamental black and white. And I'll admit it, sometimes it just feels good to have the bad guys get what they deserve, while the good guys ride away in their white hats - no remorse, no regret, no second guessing.As usual, Lee Child's writing is crisp and clean, with good attention to detail. Personal is a fast, easy read that is hard to put down.I've read all of the previous Jack Reacher books in order, which is the way I recommend that people read them. But, having said that, Personal is probably not a bad choice for someone unfamiliar with the series who wants to jump in without starting at the beginning.

"Like my T-shirt says, ""Michigan is My Great Lake,"" so I was happy to have the opportunity to review this book, which is set on the shores of Lake Michigan on Wisconsin's Door Peninsula and Washington Island. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy ""North of the Tension Line"" quite as much as I hoped.I do like the author's writing style and I thought she did a good job of describing the area and assembling a nice cast of secondary characters. There is humor, mostly related to the presence of Robert the goat, who was probably my favorite character. The story is low key and sweet, but very slow paced.However, while I liked the beginning and end of the book, getting through the middle was a miserable slog. Several times I considered not finishing the book. On top of that, I didn't really like the main character, Fiona. As one of the other characters in the book commented, ""she hasn't got the sense God gave a goose."" Fiona brings to life the phrase ""muddling through"" and, while I suppose some might find it charming, it mostly just annoyed me.I dithered between giving this book 3 and 4 stars. I settled on 4 stars because the parts that I liked, I liked very much, and I think that slog through the middle of the book could be fixed fairly easily by an editor who would ruthlessly trim excess material.

"This is a beautiful fan. The ""royal bronze"" finish is more of a rich, deep brown. The fan blades reverse from a walnut color (my choice) to a weathered black finish. This is the smoothest, quietest fan I've ever seen. It comes with a balancing kit, but it wasn't needed. And, even on the highest speed, it is practically silent.The fan can be mounted in three ways: on a slant for sloped ceilings and straight for flat ceilings, either close to the ceiling or dropped down slightly. Anyone who is reasonably handy can mount this fan without professional help, especially since there is no light kit. However, the last time I replaced a ceiling fan myself, I ran through my entire vocabulary of curse words and skinned my knuckles, so this time I opted to have an electrician come and install it. He confirmed that it was fairly simple to install, and I never heard him curse once.I turn my fan on and off using a wall switch, but the speed has to be changed using the pull chain. I added an extra piece of chain (not included) to make it long enough to reach without having to climb on a stool. I am very pleased with the quality, operation, and appearance of this fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DB1EGAW5DS1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGKF4BY#wasThisHelpful","R1DB1EGAW5DS1Z","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I selected this book to review based on the claims that it was reminiscent of The Three Musketeers. I love Dumas' books about the Musketeers. The comparison is sort of accurate, but I'd say Traitor's Blade is more like a David Lynch version of The Three Musketeers, complete with quirky humor and a touch of surrealism. And, since Twin Peaks is one of my all-time favorite TV shows, this is definitely a good thing.The history of the main character, Falcio Val Monde, and the Greatcoats is told in flashbacks as the main story line unfolds. I confess that after the first flashback, I groaned a bit because flashbacks do often interrupt the flow of the story. But, in Traitor's Blade the arrangement worked well for me. I liked this book from the beginning, but somewhere around the midpoint was where I really fell for story and got swept up in the action. Falcio and his two friends and partners, Brasti and Kest, were easy to root for and the villains were easy to hate. I suppose they, and especially the villains, could be accused of being 2-dimensional and there are certainly a few plot points that don't bear close scrutiny, but I liked the book enough to just let those things go by without too much thought.If you enjoy fantasy, swordplay, and epic quests, I highly recommend this book. If you've also got a quirky sense of humor and enjoy a little bit of weird, I recommend it even more. This book left me with a smile on my face and I look forward to reading future books by this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31YQVXZG7TJNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623658098#wasThisHelpful","R31YQVXZG7TJNE","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you haven't read the previous books in this series, I highly recommend that you do before reading this one. Indeed, on the title page, the author recommends that you read the series in order. Thus far, each book ends by setting up the next book and the story  flows directly from one book into the next.I have enjoyed all of the books in the series and Obsidian Curse is just as good as the rest. The stories are set mostly in a small town in the midwest populated by interesting and quirky characters. Like the other books in the series, Obsidian Curse blends genres - mystery, romance, fantasy - and is alternately funny, suspenseful, and dramatic. Overall, the tone is light and this book is a great airplane or beach read.I'm looking forward to the next book in the series. Obsidian Curse wraps up quite a few loose ends and, it seems to me, brings Stacy to a more stable and settled point. Of course, like the previous books in the series, this one ends with a teaser to lead you into the next book in the series and I can't wait to see what happens next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CR85NY3YDG8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477820124#wasThisHelpful","R1CR85NY3YDG8N","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lamp has many positives. It feels solid, produces a bright light, and is small enough to sit on the corner of your desk and not be in the way. It really will fit in a backpack or briefcase as the manufacturer's description says. I'd say that the small size is its number one selling feature. If small size is critical for you, this lamp would be an excellent choice.However, I own a larger natural spectrum lamp and missed some of the features offered by that lamp. In particular, I really like the timer and choice of light settings on my other lamp. For me, size is not critical, so I think I will stick with my larger lamp.

"The dog says that these deserve 5 stars because he loves them, even more than he loved the Milo's Kitchen Steak Grillers that we tried recently.I like the fact that these treats are small and soft enough to pull apart into even smaller pieces if I need to. And I love that my dog gets so excited about getting the treats.  Another plus is that the treats are made in the US, since so many people are concerned about feeding dog food and treats made in China. However, I don't like the smell. It isn't a bad smell, exactly. I think I've cooked spicy chicken dishes that had a similar scent. But, it's strong and overpowering when you open the package.I do like the Milo's Kitchen brand and some of their other dog treats, so while I will certainly buy Milo's Kitchen dog treats in the future, I probably won't buy these again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P6QX7OCISNRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INTTEV6#wasThisHelpful","R3P6QX7OCISNRT","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, if you haven't read the first two books in this trilogy, do not read this one - yet. You need to read Pines and Wayward before you read The Last Town. And, if you've already read and liked the first two books, you will definitely want to read this one. Pre-order it now, if you haven't already.Having already read and reviewed the first two books, I find myself at somewhat of a loss in attempting to review this one because I feel like I've already said it all. The characters are interesting and compelling, the action is non-stop, and the suspense will keep you turning the pages way past bedtime. And, once again, the author managed to surprise me with the end - I never saw it coming.Like the first two books, there are some plot holes, some things that don't quite add up, and some nagging little questions that occasionally tapped on the back of my head as I read The Last Town. But, the story whipped along so quickly and I enjoyed the ride so much that it was relatively easy to stuff all those things into a little box, close the lid, and toss it into a closet.I highly recommend this trilogy to anyone who ever watched and loved The Twilight Zone. That is what I was most often reminded of while reading Pines, Wayward, and The Last Town.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DEMTQTWH6MIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477822585#wasThisHelpful","R2DEMTQTWH6MIG","A1N6AY0XTAPBM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N6AY0XTAPBM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 6 piece bakeware set is probably the best I have seen at a great price. It has everything you need for basic baking needs and makes a great gift for a new home or bridal shower. I moved into a new place and was looking for a good 'starter' set of bakeware.The 6 pieces are high quality and are easy to clean becasue of the non-stick surface.

"Harry wanted a dog. Not just any dog, but a small dog. A cute little dog like the one he and his brother had when he was a boy. Her name was Queenie. Harry and his brother really loved Queenie, but they didn‚Äôt take very good care of her needs like feeding her and walking her, so their mom sent her away to live with another family.One day Harry came across a store that sold life-like mechanical dogs. Just out of curiosity, because Harry wanted a REAL dog, not some robot.. The salesman, Archibald Galdensen, seemed to be very well informed on how these robot-dogs worked. He told Harry that even though they looked and acted just like a REAL dog, they didn‚Äôt require any of the usual caretaking obligations like feeding and walking. They looked completely life-like, too. Nobody would tell Harry didn‚Äôt have a real dog.Mr Galdensen asked Harry what type of dog he prefered and what sex. Harry told him he wanted a cute little mixed breed and female. He basically was describing Queenie, the dog he had as a boy. Pretty soon, Harry was walking out with a new dog-a very expensive, mechanical, dog.Harry knew his wife Pam didn‚Äôt want any dogs. He knew he was going to have one hell of a time explaining to her why he came home with one. He also knew once his kids saw Queenie, as he name her, (after his boyhood dog), they would fall in love and Pam would not be able to say ‚Äúno‚Äù.As soon as Harry told her Queenie wouldn‚Äôt eat or poop like a real dog, she would accept Queenie into the family. Everything would work itself out.Harry was right. At first, Pam wasn‚Äôt happy that Harry brought home a dog without consulting her first, but after seeing how happy their two children, Ariel and her brother, Jackson were and how much they loved playing with Queenie, she agreed the dog could stay.For a while, things were great. Ariel and Jackson loved Queenie, and Harry finally had his dog. Then one day, something happened that shouldn‚Äôt have. After that things were a little off with Queenie. Things started to happen. Some things that just didn‚Äôt seem right.Was Queenie really just a computer run dog with a glitch? Or was something deeper and more sinister happening?Sal Conte writes horror that starts you off feeling confident you won‚Äôt be scared, but then builds a story that has you keeping the lights on at night. When I began Baad Dog, I felt like I was riding a roller coaster of reading, the story building, the tension getting greater. It keep me on edge, as most of his books do. It was clear to me Queenie wasn‚Äôt what Harry thought and that things would not end too well.Baad Dog is a novella that only took me about a day and a half to read. It had a pace that started off creeping along and then shot off into a nail biting suspense thriller. Beware the BAAD DOG!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N5YOP6GU6EZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016GX197C#wasThisHelpful","R1N5YOP6GU6EZZ","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All Of Me is the second book in the Covington Cove series by Kelly Moran, which began with book one: Return to Me.Though characters from book one are a big part of All Of Me, it centers on two new people not in Return To Me,  Alec, who is a best-selling writer of horror fiction stuck with a bad case of writer's block, and Faith, a young woman starting a new beginning for herself, away from her home.Alec is strong, but sensitive, a quality I very much appreciate seeing in a lead male.Faith is sweet, shy and a bit vulnerable.  I admit at first I was not sure I could see these two as a couple.Both Alec and Faith have come to Covington Cove in Wilmington, NC for their own reasons. Alec, for his brother's wedding and Faith to take on a position as a care giver for Mia Covington's younger sister.Mia was the heroine of Return to Me and it was nice to see her and Cole again and know their story continues to be a happy one.Now back to Alec and Faith. Both of these people have some heavy emotional baggage.Alec has been through a rough past which has caused him to withdraw from any real emotional connection with a woman. Faith has never felt loved by anyone, including her own parents.The connection between the two of them starts out slow, but builds as the story moves forward.I'm glad Kelly Moran knows how to write a realistic story and write it well, NO two people like Alec and Faith would come together in real life without some obstacles in their way and Ms Moran shows this in a way that is believable.I felt Faith's insecurities as if they were my own and I sympathized with Alec's plight.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this sweet story about letting go of the past, moving on and letting your heart be your guide.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R65QWSWIMR5OW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI0B6HU#wasThisHelpful","R65QWSWIMR5OW","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a Philips Sonicare Diamond clean rechargeable toothbrush and when I need replacement brush heads, I always just bought what came with the original brush kit. They worked well and I didn't think there was anything that would be better. After trying these adaptive clean heads, I know I'm not going back to the others.These are slightly larger than the original heads and not as soft, so if you prefer a smaller head with soft bristles, I would not recommend these. What I can definitely say is that they are quite powerful in deep cleaning. After the first use, I could feel a difference and my teeth felt cleaner than with the other brush heads.I have had some dental work done and I am always concerned that I'm not getting my teeth as clean after eating certain foods. The bristles really reach all the back areas of my mouth and I didn't feel I had to ""double brush"" as I sometimes felt with the others.The only thing I do not like (and it wasn't worth taking off a star for) is the brush cover. It fits on the front of the brush and not over the entire top, like the original diamond clean heads. Small sacrifice to make in exchange for a cleaning feeling mouth. I will be buying these from now on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z3EZU97HVE2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012QQEVM8#wasThisHelpful","R2Z3EZU97HVE2A","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My hair's natural state lies somewhere between straight and wavy. It's very thick and I usually spend a lot of time getting it to look good. Living in a place with high humidity makes it hard to control my frizz and sometimes I just want to wash my hair and go without a lot of fuss.There are several brands of sea salt sprays out there, and I admittedly have tried quite a few. When Tresemme came out with their version, I knew it would be worth trying, since I use many of their products already with great results.Since my hair is not super straight, I followed the directions for wavy hair. I towel dried my hair to get rid of excess water and then applied the spray liberally over my entire head, including underneath. Then I lightly combed it through before scrunching a bit. After that, I let it dry naturally. My end result was indeed lots of waves that looked better than the frizz I am used to if I air dry alone. I ended up with loose soft waves, with a just a bit of stickiness that I was able to get rid of by scrunching up my hair a bit more.My hair is not real long, but I imagine if it was , the results would have been even better.This is something I would definitely use when I want a carefree, messy look to my hair and I don't want to spend a lot of time flat ironing it straight.The product has a light sent that is not really ""beachy"" but not unpleasant, either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PYEVFUS5VV21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJU8Y#wasThisHelpful","R2PYEVFUS5VV21","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I already have a small air purifier that I keep in my bedroom because it seems to be the one room that always collects dust and I have allergies that cause me to wake up during the night congested. When I saw the AeroMax Air Purifier was created specifically for pet owners, I thought that might work better because I have a cat ,who sleeps on my bed with me. I was wrong. I'm not saying the AeroMax does not work at all, I just don't feel it is better than what I am using.First,it says on the box that it is quiet. Well, I can tell you that it's not THAT quiet. If you leave the fan set to low, it's not terribly loud, but my other purifier is quieter on the highest setting. I can actually hear this in my living room when I'm watching TV. I would never be able to set the fan to high, especially in my bedroom because it's keep me from falling asleep. I do NOT suggest it for bedrooms unless you aren't bothered by noise at night.Another thing that I am concerned with is the expense of buying TWO replacement filters. The HEPA and the carbon. I know having two filters probably makes it more effective, but these filters are not cheap. I am guessing my the amount of dust I already had to clean off them in little over a month, I would be buying them often.I don't really feel this product is worth the money it costs as well as for replacement filters, plus it doesn't seem to do that much better of a job than what I have , which is smaller in size and less noisy at the highest speed.What I did like is the fact it's black and less noticeable, but appearance is not as important as quality to me. Also, it did not come with any type of instruction manual. Just a fold out which didn't say much.This might work for someone with a larger house if you put it somewhere where the noise will not interfere , but it's not for me.

"I've been using clumping cat litter for years and been pretty satisfied with the quality. My only issue was always the weight of the package made it difficult to transport from store to car to house.When manufacturers started to make these lightweight versions, I bought one of my usual brand to try. I was pretty happy with it, but am always open to trying a different brand to see if there is anything better or different about it.The Cat's Pride Fresh and Light is much darker in color than any litter I have ever used. It seems to have a finer grain to it. The scent isn't that bad and it's not too strong that it can be smelled outside of the room I keep the liter box. I think it's just enough to mask odor, without blowing you away with too much scent.What I did not like was that it didn't seem to clump as well as other ones I have tried. When scooping out the hard pieces, the ones that were not already broken up ,broke when I scooped them. I'm a little OCD about my box being as clean as possible and I try to clean out any waste as soon as I am aware my cat used the box. I was changing the whole box about once every other week because the previous brand I used clumped so tight, there was rarely any extra left in the box. With this litter, I had to change it after one week of use. For me, that's not cost effective. Also, I had to used an entire bucket to fill my box. With other brands, I was still left with some to ""top off"" after I took out waste. I think it's because the grain is so fine. I don't find it to be much lighter, either. Overall, It's not bad, just not better than my current litter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4KNG4GZS4UMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6EXLDA#wasThisHelpful","R4KNG4GZS4UMF","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Give Up The Ghost is book 2 in The Phantoms Trilogy, which centers on a team of investigators featured on a popular ghosthunting tv show.I had previously read book one, Ghost of  A Promise, and really enjoyed it, but I have to say I enjoyed this book much more.  The story centers on Paul , a researcher for the team and Kerry, one of the investigators.Paul and Kerry have been the best of friends for 6 years and when Kerry is faced which a frightening paranormal experience of her own, he is the first person she calls for help.  Paul rushes to Kerry's side. His is concerned as her friend, but also because unbeknownst to Kerry, Paul has been in love with her from the moment they met.As the team sets off on their next investigation in a small desert ghosttown, Kerry's experiences continue and Paul is drawn even closer to her. When he can no longer fight his feeling, he lets loose with a kiss. Kerry is surprised, but begins to realize that deep down, she has also felt something for Paul that extends beyond friendship.In most cases, all of this word be good news for two friends to admit their growing love, but it is clearly stated in both of their contracts, as with all the Phantoms team members, that any type of romantic interaction is prohibited and grounds for termination.Afraid of losing their careers, Kerry and Paul try to keep their secret for the time being and concentrate on the investigation at hand. As many frightening situations come about, it becomes harder, though, and Paul begins to think maybe his feelings for Kerry are more important than the TV show he has been a part of for the past 6 years.The writing has a perfect blend of the paranormal storyline mixed with the blooming romance between Paul and Kerry. I enjoyed reading about the teams investigation and discoveries so much, it would still kept my interest if it didn't include the romance. However, Kelly Moran is an exceptional romance author and Paul and Kerry's story definitely as interesting as the paranormal storyline.I'm not willing to give too much away, as I believe in leaving it up to the readers to find out for themselves how it all turns out in the end and trust me, it is well worth it. This book was a page-turner for me and I am quite excited to read the 3rd book as well. I image it will be just as good, if not better! Kelly Moran continues to be one of my favorite authors and her books are always at the top of my ""to be read"" list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15QIIFOHFIDYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3HITLY#wasThisHelpful","R15QIIFOHFIDYG","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This shower curtain is much nicer then it looks in the picture.  Made from a very fine polyester material, in an elegant lattice  lace pattern. I was glad to see there is a clear plastic reinforcement under the top, because the holes for hooks are not lined with any type of metal grommets. The material itself is quite sheer, making it see through. I always use a liner with my shower curtains, but with this one, a clear one will look better then white. I'm using it in a guest bath, so there will not be a mess of shampoo and bath care products showing. If you are ordering this, do take the fact it us see through into consideration. I am very pleased with the grey and am sorry I did not get the purple when it was offered previously.

That was the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW6873YCN57EL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQYFQES#wasThisHelpful","RW6873YCN57EL","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can honestly say that this is close to being the best vacuum I have ever owned. It is very lightweight and easy to move around the house. I was able to get around corners and under my coffee table.  It picks up dust and dirt with ease, and then there are the attachments.The attachments all fit right on the vacuum, which makes keeping it easy to change off when needed. You switch from regular to attachment mode with the click of a switch. The pet hair attachment is great for cleaning my cat's bed of all the excess hair . This is designed specifically for pet owners, it seems to live up to that standard. Bagless, it's easy to open and empty, plus a washable filter saves money. I am very pleased with it overall and even like the fuschia color.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZB6RNU4GAFU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7C7M3M#wasThisHelpful","R1ZB6RNU4GAFU3","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used this hair color in the Rich Chocolate Brown on my mom's hair because it is very close to the color she has been having done in a salon. The color was easy to apply and was enough to cover all of her medium length hair completely. A nice aspect of this hair color is that it has a neutral smell and not too strong like some permanent colors. I was concerned that it would fade like some demi-permanent colors (which is an issue she has in the salon) but it has lasted almost a month now. Not a but of grey has come through and the color is quite pretty.Application, as I said , was easy and it felt very smooth going through her hair. I didn't have trouble getting all through and she even commented that her hair felt incredible soft after washing out. It looks fantastic ,too! I believe she is going to use this product from now on because it is a better color than she gets in the salon and having me apply it for her is much less expensive, too! I may try it in a red on myself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36CQHSPC220H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP236BY#wasThisHelpful","R36CQHSPC220H1","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I will say that this product is not to used solely as a ""slimming product"" and it does say so on the box. As a skin care professional, I am well aware that often products can REDUCE the appearance of cellulite over time, but really only diet and exercise can help reduce it. That being said, here is how I feel about the product .This is nothing more than a TEMPORARY self -tanning spray. I recommend applying it an area where it will not get on anything, or put old towels down, first. When I first applied the spray, it looked very dark orange and my first reaction was ""oh, no. I'm going to look like an Oompa Loompa."" The directions suggest rubbing in the product and after I did that, it was better, but still left me with a very fake looking color. I am very fair skinned and the few times I get any sun on my, it does not look like this. I just feel the color was too noticeably artificial.The basic fact is this product is what it is: an artificial tanner meant to give a ""glow"" to the skin. If you apply it carefully, it will not look too terrible,but you must make sure you are evenly applying it, or it will leave some areas noticeably pale. Use caution on parts of the body such as knees, feet and hands because that is where it will appear darker. Also, a good idea is to wear gloves when applying or wash hands IMMEDIATELY after to avoid staining of the palms. I didn't like the fact that the whole point of this was that it is an SPRAY and therefore you really shouldn't even have to use your hands to apply. It does dry quite fast and has a touch of shimmer, which I liked. Another good aspect is that it is not thick like an self tanning cream and it does NOT have an awful odor. It really didn't have much at all.What I really did not like was that after all my efforts, after one shower, the color was GONE. So now I had to apply it after every shower. I think I will save this product for special occasions when I want to appear to have a slight tan, such as my sister's wedding . Also, it would look better if  you already have a base tan because it will enhance it,Overall, not something I would buy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TM7JDVW8ZDQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QHX7NO0#wasThisHelpful","R3TM7JDVW8ZDQ8","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TheraBreath is a unique take on mouth rinses. It's made with natural ingredients like chamomile and aloe, so it's very soothing and gentle. It has a little cap on top for easy measuring the right amount. I have had dental work done and still get gum irritation after eating certain foods, so I was looking for a mouth rinse that would be less harsh than most on the market and this works pretty well for my needs.There is one thing I dislike, which is the flavor. While it has a touch of a minty taste, it has xylitol, which is a sugar alcohol used in many diabetic foods, and it leaves an aftertaste in my mouth. I just rinse with water afterwards and that usually helps.I like that it is alcohol free, taking away the burning  feeling I sometimes get from some mouth rinses.Overall, this is a good product for people with mouth sensitivity. Great for when I have my teeth cleaned because my mouth is always irritated and sore afterwards.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G6P5TL6TP54N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VN04SY0#wasThisHelpful","R3G6P5TL6TP54N","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I tried many options, but was still never completely satisfied.Bic Soleil Bella is the first disposable razor I have tried that gave me a truly close shave with no missed hairs and no nics or cuts! I was even able to go a few days without shaving my legs!This incredible find has 4 flexible blades and a pivoting head, which makes it easy to get close, even in hard to shave areas.

"This is an amazing little gadget! I have similar products advertised and in stores and was very interested in checking it out, so when I was offered an opportunity to review one for amazon vine at no cost, I jumped! I am on my feet all day at work and living in Florida, spend a lot of my free time barefoot. These are 2 very good reasons I wanted (and needed) this. Well, I was not disappointed! I want to say I was simply amazed at how FAST it worked. I saw instant results. Now,my fet were not really all that bad, but I did have some rough patches and very dry, cracked heels. Guess what? I DO  NOT ANYMORE!This comes with 2 heads. One for really rough, coarse skin (blue) and another for softening and polishing (purple). I used the blue first all over my heels and on the pads of my feet. Wow. I just can't say enough how fast this works. I do recommend 2 things. First, I would place down a towel or cloth to ""catch"" all the dry skin that will flake off. It's a bit messy. Second, I would suggest using a foot cream- one specifically for feet, not a regular hand or body lotion- and use it right after. It will help with the softening.Do not worry that this is something that will cause irritaion or any real discomfort with use. I know some of the advertised foot products look like they might be painful or make your feet sore after. Not The Silk'n.  It barely felt like I was doing anything and my feet were super soft and smooth after. Now I am ready for summer sandles and flip flops without worrying about my feet looking old and dry.Along with the 2 heads, it also comes with the 2 AA batteries needed and a cleaning brush. I do wish it came with a storage case, but I am using an old makeup case I have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S6GE4OAL6YKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0GBRL6#wasThisHelpful","R1S6GE4OAL6YKP","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a few things I like about this product. 1. The relaxing and soothing scentt of lavender has always had a calming effect on me. 2. It can be used hot or cold, which is nice because sometimes warming it up makes it even more effective because it intensifies the aroma . Unfortunately, there are also some things I DO NOT like about this. 1. I felt it was a bit ""heavy"" and that makes it a bit awkward. It tends to fall off my face and THAT doesn't help me relax at all. 2. I don't care for the material it's made of. A cotton type material would have been more comfortable in my opinion, but it's not too bad.If you do not like lavender or any strong scent, I urge you to pass on this. It can be very strong coming out of the package and even just laying on my coffee tabel after use, I could smell it across the room. I personally, am a fan of lavender, do I like it.As for using it for migraines, I didn't feel it helped that much. My migraines are pretty bad, so it might just be me.This comes from a well known brand and is also eco-friendly, which makes me feel good about using it.Overall, it's nice to place it over my eyes and relax or take a nap. It does work well, but it's just not something I would be raving to everyone about.  Hence, the 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YY1D5KS8SZE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDMZDHK#wasThisHelpful","R1YY1D5KS8SZE1","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Normally, when I make any kind of stir-fry dish, I make my own sauce, but when I had the opportunity to try this skillet sauce from McCormick, I decided it give it a shot.As the package suggests, I chose to make chicken . I used about a 1 lb. of chicken cut into cubes, mixed with peppers, onions, mushrooms, as well as water chestnuts and baby corn.I cooked the chicken and vegetables as directed, fully cooking the chicken and until the vegetables were tender, but still crisp, I added the sauce. It says to let it come to a boil, it I can't say it really did because the sauce coated the ingredients perfectly, so there wasn't a lot of ""extra"" to boil. I did let it cook until the veggies were just a bit more tender, but I don't like my stir-fry to be mushy, so it wasn't much longer. .As for the taste, it was delicious! I didn't have to add any additional spices to it. I served it over brown rice and there was enough for two, leaving me leftovers as well.I will definitely purchase more of this sesame chicken skillet sauce.

"These makeup ""papers"" are a great idea and definitely convenient. I really like the darker blush because it's more flattering on my skin than the lighter pinkish one. The highlighter is a bit too shimmery for everyday, but I used it on my lids for evening. They are very convenient to carry for touch-ups throughout the day and don't make a mess. I found them quite easy to use. Either by swiping across the cheek or blotting.

"Ava Trumble lives in a haunted house. At least that is what everyone in Kerrick, Maine think. Strange occurances happen, and most of the town is afraid to enter or stay there for very long. Ava isn't afraid, though. When her aunt leaves the mansion to Ava in her will, Ava plans to turn it into a bed and breakfast. Those dreams are put on hold as she learns before the home can truly become hers, she must solve the mystery of what happened Sarah Kerrick, who disappeared over 200 years ago from the manion and whose body was never found.Feeling determined, Sarah calls upon Phantoms, a group of paranormal researchers that have a popular TV series to come investigate and help her claim the home she has lived in for years.Jackson Granger is the lead investigator of Phantoms, and as it turns out, has ties of his own to Trumble Mansion. When Jackson and Ava meet, there is attraction, but tension. As Jackson and his crew investigate the mysteries surrounding Sarah's disappearance, he finds himself drawn the her and having feelings  he has never felt for any woman before. The feelings become mutual for Ava, but she knows Jackson's time with her is temporary. Still, she cannot help the feelings developing when he is near.Falling fast for each other, amidst ghostly activity, they both have to wonder if what they feel is real-or if they are pawns of some restless spirits haunting the mansion.I have read many books catagorized as paranormal romance, but this is one of the few to contain an actual romantic storyline. I instantly liked the lead characters of Ava (the feisty, headstrong redhead) and Jackson (the rugged, handsome Brit). The chemistry was so well written, I could feel the heat jumping out of my kindle.Kelly Moran obviously did a lot of research when it came to the field of ""ghost hunting"". She knew the proper terminology and names of equipment used, which to me was important since I have been a fan of the type of TV show depicted for years.I really enjoyed the mystery of Sarah's disappearance and found it a good storyline that kept my interest as much as the unfolding romanace between Ava and Jackson. This book wasn't scary, but suspenseful and had the right blend of mystery and romance. I found it played out very well.I also enjoyed learning about the secondary characters, some of which I am happy to know will have stories of their own in the next two books in this trilogy.Kelly Moran has been one of my favorite authors of romance for years and with Ghost Of A Promise , she continues to remain so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLLOR9YRWDNQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6AVJM0#wasThisHelpful","RLLOR9YRWDNQ9","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am always looking for cat food that is healthier for my cat, but worried that she will not like a change in her food. Purina Beyond seemed like a good choice to try because she typically likes their other varieties and Ocean Whitefish flavor is one of her favorites.The only concern I had was that she prefers ""meaty"" canned food, with chunks and gravy over pate' style.I gave her about half a can to try and at first she looked at it and sniffed it. Then she tasted it and surprised me by eating quite a bit of it. Though, she didn't finish it all, she didn't scoff at it and walk away , like she has done with other foods.I tried it out a second day and also gave some to my mother's cat, who loves pate'. They both ate a little bit this time, but neither ate as much as they do with their regular food.  Purina Beyond, Grain Free is definitely something I would be happy giving my cat on a regular basis, but I think she would prefer a variety that wasn't pate'.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WGMA5BAABOB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVHSJ3I#wasThisHelpful","R2WGMA5BAABOB6","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not much to say here except that this is so much better that just putting down shelf paper. It looks nicer, has a bit of a stretch to it and is easy to apply. You just cut to fit you cabinet floor and press down. It stays putr and I even had a bit extra that I used on a closet shelf. It certainly makes the area under my kitchen sink look nice and keeps it very clean. It's non adhesive, so It can be removed to clean, but I haven't needed to do that.

"I thought the Divine Duos cat food would be something my cat would really like. It's a good combination of a pate' topped with diced food and lots of gravy. Typically, my cat loves wet food with gravy, so I was sure it would be a hit with her. Unfortunately, that's about the only thing she liked. She licked up all the gravy and ate a little of the diced food, but left all the pate'.Of course, being able to ASK her, what she thought, that is about all I can say.For me, the appearance of the food looked good and it would be something I would buy if my cat liked it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29IL456J02UNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2TXNQW#wasThisHelpful","R29IL456J02UNC","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my first experience using a French Press Coffee maker, so I don't have anything to compare it to. That being said, this OXO Press makes a really good cup of coffee!I typically brew coffee with my Keurig coffee maker for several reasons. One of them is that living by myself, I don't need to make m ore than one cup at a time and another is that it makes good coffee.I have been told by others , including my brother, how great coffee is when made with a French Press Coffee maker, so having the opportunity to review one for amazon vine, I decided to take advantage and give it a try.First, for those who don't know (I didn't) you need to buy coarsely ground coffee for it to work properly. I went to a local gourmet food store and picked up some of an old favorite flavor.The French Press is pretty easy to use. A round tablespoon is needed for each 4 ounce cup of coffee. You add the coffee, then hot (not boiled) water and the filter press. The press down and voila'! You have delicious coffee. I have to say, I really did enjoy the coffee, though on my first try, I admit I did have a few grounds floating around. I blame this on my inexperience. After more attempts, I was able to not just get a good cup of coffee, but a GREAT cup of coffee.I like the sleek silver and black design of the press , itself, as it matches nicely in my kitchen.So this French Press Coffee maker will not replace my Keurig for everyday coffee, but I will be using it for special occasions, or when I am in the mood to treat myself to something special.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJZYTLDBF7DTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYL4MOA#wasThisHelpful","RJZYTLDBF7DTP","A5ZD6FBMZQGDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5ZD6FBMZQGDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great little (focus on little) storage for your coffee pods or k-cups. The drawers each hold 9 k-cups, which is good if you have a box of 18. The top has 3 very small compartments and one large one. This is great for holding individual sugar packs. Contrary to the picture, it does NOT have round circle slots in the drawers, which I found to be a good thing. This storage container is good to keep a small selection of coffee pods on the counter, but here's a tip- It also would make an excellent storage container for make-up or organizing hair accessories. Personally, I may use it for just that because I have way more than 18 kcups and it looks more suited for a bathroom counter than a kitchen one.

"Cody Wilde made a promise to his dying father‚Äîhe would always avoid trouble‚Äîa difficult promise to keep in a rural Texas town where he‚Äôs bullied by the sheriff‚Äôs son. Cassie Strong found it hard to understand why people always picked on Cody, who had only shown her sweetness and kindness. In fact, she was the only person to see the nice side of him. When tragedy strikes her life, Cody is there for her, and their friendship becomes something more.As they enter adulthood, Cody tries to avoid becoming too attached to Cassie, but can‚Äôt continue to deny his feelings. When his childhood enemy reenters their lives, he resolves to keep Cassie safe, but when Cassie is raped, Cody is faced with a problem‚Äîhe can protect Cassie only by violating the oath he made to his father.The three Strong & Wilde series by L. A. Castillo follows Cody and Cassie from their teen years until the crisis of adulthood that forces them to make some life-changing decisions. Strong action, stronger emotions, and a harsh, demanding setting makes this a blistering read that is part romance, part thriller, and all fascinating.

"M‚Äôrain is on the threshold of womanhood, but she is restless and longs to know more than just the desert world in which her village is located. One day, while out food gathering, she wanders far, and after taking shelter in a cave, is taken captive by a band of women who are under the thrall of a mad man who claims to have magic powers. With the help of the enigmatic lizard, Glick, M‚Äôrain escapes and makes her way through the labyrinth of tunnels and into a land like known she‚Äôs ever known. Glick informs her that she is the chosen one, a Traveler, who can transit the labyrinth and serve as the link between the two people.

Hertzberger can put a lot of meaning in a few words, and the images conjured up by her prose were fantastic.This is a story that begs for a sequel‚Äîperhaps the story of M‚Äôrain and P‚Äôpuck‚Äôs heirs.

"Those with strong religious beliefs will probably not like reading anything renowned scientist and atheist Richard Dawkins writes. But, the second offering of his memoirs, Brief Candle in the Dark: My Life in Science, is worth reading regardless of your religion. Dawkins goes into some detail in this book about his scientific and religious beliefs (or disbeliefs), but the key thing is his take on those who have in some way influenced him through the years. If there is a weakness in the theories Dawkins espouses, it‚Äôs that if evolution is as determinative as he believes, how can there still be so many people who refuse to believe in it. I say that tongue in cheek, because there have always been, and will always be, people who cannot accept any fact that contradicts cherished beliefs.Brief Candle in the Dark is a book about science written for laymen; it uses a thematic/literary style in order to maintain interest, rather than a straight chronological style, and esoteric/complicated scientific terms are used sparingly.I got the audiobook version of Instaread‚Äôs Brief Candle in the Dark: My Life in Science by Richard Dawkins/Summary & Review, and was as usual impressed. Being able to get an in depth summary of a book in a mere 15 minutes is a treat for those of us with busy schedules.

"While aerobic exercise is important, it's also important to do resistance and strength exercises. During my time in the army, one of the exercises that benefited me most was the pushup. But, pushups can be difficult and hard on the hands. These pushup bars can be quite useful in keeping the hands in the correct position, and in addition, because they have the hands off the floor they put more resistance on the shoulder and back muscles. The grips are great for maintaining position and the nonslip pads make them useful on any surface. Assembling them was a snap (pun intended) with the flanges holding them in place tightly. Luckily, putting them together was pretty intuitive, as there were no instructions included--which would be helpful for people who're not adept at assembling things. This, though, is a minor point.

"Mankind has been studying the universe‚Äîboth the macro universe of the galaxies and stars and the micro universe of subatomic particles‚Äîsince ancient times, and it is still a mystery. Stephen Hawking, one of the greatest minds of the 20th and 21st centuries, in his book A Brief History of Time attempts to shed some light on the nature of both universes. While the book is written in plain language, what seems to come through is there remain more questions than answers. But, Hawking at least points the way to further research into efforts to develop a unified theory, or an explanation of ‚Äòeverything.‚ÄôEven though it‚Äôs in nontechnical language, this is a book that‚Äôs likely to appeal mostly to those interested in science, which is a shame, because what Hawking has to say is important. If you don‚Äôt read the book itself, I would at least suggest reading A Brief History of Time: by Stephen Hawking/Key Takeaways, Analysis & Review by Instaread. This handy little book, that can be read in 15 minutes, will give you the essence of Hawking‚Äôs book, and it just might entice you to dive into the full work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O8E8839Q15S7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017WCKLES#wasThisHelpful","R3O8E8839Q15S7","A2OHRT539LLCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OHRT539LLCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Robert B. Reich‚Äôs Saving Capitalism is a comprehensive look at how economics and politics combine in the US to produce economic inequality. Reich debunks the myths that the uber-rich perpetuate about the free market, as well as many other misperceptions about economic issues. His main thesis is that it‚Äôs not about free market versus big government as a host of conservative politicians and their wealthy backers would have you believe, but about creating a market economy that further enriches the top 1% versus one that is designed to benefit the majority of citizens.Reich manages to remain mostly apolitical in his book, focusing on the things that people of all political persuasions can do to improve their lives and benefit the country at large‚Äîsomething all too many of our current crop of politicians fail to do.Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few by Robert B. Reich/Key Takeaways, Analysis & Review by Instaread is another great introduction to a book that many lay readers might be reluctant to purchase. The overview and analysis of the book‚Äôs key takeaways removes much of the mystique, and just might entice people to want to read it.

"As a young girl, Skye Cree was brutally assaulted by Ronny Wayne Whitfield. But, Skye is a survivor, and with her Nez Perce spirit guide, the wolf Kiya, she is, as a young women, determined to use her ability to protect others. Traumatized by the childhood incident, Skye avoids intimate contact with men until she saves Josh Anders, CEO of a game company, from muggers, and sparks fly between them. For the first time in her adult life, Skye is in love. But that love is threatened when she learns that Whitfield is out of jail, and young girls are going missing.The Bones of Others by Vickie McKeehan tells the story of Skye and Josh as they vow to track Whitfield down and bring him to justice. As they peer deeper into the missing person cases, though, they discover that it‚Äôs more than just a single predator attacking young women, they find an international trafficking operation involving dozens. McKeehan does a fantastic job of keeping a reader guessing until the end‚Äîwill Skye and Josh prevail, or will they too become victims? Though this story contains elements of the supernatural, it is told as a mystery thriller, complete with enough action to appeal to the most rabid fight junkie. At the same time, the author handles Skye‚Äôs awakening feelings for Josh with astonishing tenderness.Once you start reading this book, you won‚Äôt be able to put it down. I look forward to further adventures of these two extremely likeable characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROZXV3B8GCJ3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B73XV00#wasThisHelpful","ROZXV3B8GCJ3A","A2OHRT539LLCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OHRT539LLCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Dr. Richard Buckley returned to him home in Dunderrig after service in France in WWI, he was disillusioned with war and only wanted to be with his family. Returning with him was Solange Allingham, the widow of his best friend. Unfortunately, Buckley‚Äôs wife, Edith, bitter at him for serving in the British Army, sworn enemies of the nationalist Irish, becomes even more withdrawn after the birth of twins, James and Juliet, leaving them to Solange‚Äôs care. Eventually, Edith leaves him and goes to Dublin where she eventually marries a German national, despite never having officially divorcing.The twins grow up under Solange‚Äôs care, considering her more their mother than the woman who gave birth to them. As the world enters the horror unleashed by the rise of Hitler in Germany, the twins grow into adulthood and their lives take divergent paths‚Äîpaths that threaten the unity of the Buckley family.So Much Owed by Jean Grainger is a stirring tale of the horrors of war and its impact on one family during a time of cataclysmic change. It reveals the depths of human emotion; love, betrayal, loyalty, and bravery in a way that most novels only touch on sketchily. The author takes a reader into the hearts and minds of the characters in such a way you come away feeling as if you know them as well as your next door neighbor‚Äîor best friend. This is s book that will bring tears to your eyes while at the same time leave you with a warm feeling in your heart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAPTS5OJ999MX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H22IPBU#wasThisHelpful","RAPTS5OJ999MX","A2OHRT539LLCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OHRT539LLCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Almost everyone, even those with secrets they‚Äôd like to keep hidden, pitches in to honor Quinn, and on the night of the big event, when the curtain opens and the spotlight shines, Quinn is missing.The Disappearance by Olivia Newport is part one of a five part series. Character development is outstanding, and the author pulls the reader fully into the action. The series concept, though, where the book ends on a complete cliffhanger, is not my cup of tea. When I like a series, I‚Äôll read subsequent books without the ruse of leaving things hanging, forcing me to read the next book to find out what‚Äôs happening.This is a great book for TV series fans, people who tune in week after week to find out ‚ÄòWho shot JR?‚Äô.

"As an avid sci-fi fan for more than 50 years, I approach most new science fiction books with a healthy dose of skepticism. It‚Äôs difficult to find new works that truly break ground in the genre. The Beam: Season One by Sean Platt and Johnny B. Truant comes pretty darn close in my humble opinion.In a future when humanity is totally connected, he who controls the Web has control over everything. The world‚Äôs political borders have disappeared, leaving only two political parties in control‚Äîand control is what they‚Äôre all about. This is a cutting edge story of a group of people caught up in this soulless political machine, where every whim is catered to, but deviance is fatal.Well written, with enough explanation of the technology to make it just about believable. The important element here is the way the characters react to their environment and each other.

But Kyam will only reveal the name if Qui Tai promises to help him.The Devil‚Äôs Concubine by Jill Braden is a hard novel to categorize.

Braden has done an excellent job of creating a believable fantasy world, and her characters are easy to develop feelings for‚Äîlove or hate. The murky relationship between Qui Tai and Kyam is perhaps the best part of this story of a character who must deal with her internal demons while trying to save her people. There‚Äôs enough here to please fans of the fantasy genre, with enough action thrown in to keep adventure junkies reading.While it ends with almost all of the loose ends tied up, the question of Qui Tai‚Äôs feelings for Kyam, and what becomes of him was left hanging, which was a bit disappointing, but not enough that it kept me from thoroughly enjoying the story that unfolded.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H6EH6Q5A0MIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLS5PEU#wasThisHelpful","R3H6EH6Q5A0MIS","A2OHRT539LLCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OHRT539LLCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In order to survive in this barren environment, Aapelli has developed a series of iron-clad rules. His rules, however, come into question when he rescues an abandoned Liberty, who soon shakes up his extremely organized existence.In Finding Liberty by Regina Puckett, we get the story of how Liberty came to be. The author tells a compelling story of how two people come to know and love each other, and how Liberty learns to cope with great loss as she discovers that she can no longer be daddy‚Äôs little girl.Written with humor and compassion, this is a book that young adults will like, but has lessons for old greybeards as well.

"I received a free copy of The Christmas Cats Fear for the Deer, written by Constance Corcoran Wilson and illustrated by Gary McCluskey in exchange for my review.The Christmas cats worry about a herd of deer that are grazing in an area where they can do damage to crops and are in danger from hunters. Told in verse, with colorful paintings, the book shows how the cats find a unique way to help keep the deer safe, avoid damage to the crops, and come up with an alternative delivery vehicle for Christmas.Some of the verses, especially those that show hunting in a less than negative light, might be a bit intense for some children, and the rhyming is a bit rough in some verses, it will entertain many. Looking past the portrayal of hunters, though, it does show that problems can be solved if one thinks beyond the usual solutions, and the activity pages at the end are nice for helping younger readers learn problem solving.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NJ6KZ8DH9QO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143ZBLSM#wasThisHelpful","R1NJ6KZ8DH9QO2","A2OHRT539LLCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OHRT539LLCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"TV‚Äôs Dr. Phil McGraw‚Äôs book The 20/20 Diet is a guide to dieting for people who haven‚Äôt been successful taking weight off and keeping it off. It offers solutions to the seven most common reasons diets fail by combining longstanding strategies with the results of recent research. An easy-to-follow diet plan in three phases over a 30-day period, it offers no quick fixes; instead, it stresses that good weight management is based on developing proper habits and achieving balance in eating and exercise.  Though McGraw is not a diet specialist, and the book is written in layman‚Äôs terms, he uses his own experience with weight control problems to illustrate how to achieve success. For those who have seen ‚ÄòDr Phil‚Äô on TV, the tone of the book, humorous in places, scathing in others, will be familiar.A Review of Dr. Phil McGraw‚Äôs The 20/20 Diet by Eureka Books is an excellent summary of the book, and makes it sound like one that is well worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26MQD8YDFYA5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01744LNUA#wasThisHelpful","R26MQD8YDFYA5W","A2OHRT539LLCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OHRT539LLCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A 15-minute Summary & Analysis of Andy Weir‚Äôs The Martian by Instareads is an excellent review of the novel that tells the story of the abandonment and subsequent rescue of astronaut Mark Watney from the planet Mars.Watney, believed killed in a freak Martian dust storm, was left behind by the rest of his crew. Later, it is discovered that he survived and has found a way to communicate with NASA. The story is both a science fiction thriller and a profound tale of human perseverance in the face of adversity. The author tells the story by way of Watney‚Äôs log, which he keeps as a record in case he dies on Mars. It contrasts bureaucrats who assess risks and keep an eye on the bottom line with those who are willing to risk all in order to save a comrade.If you‚Äôve seen the movie you owe it to yourself to read the book that inspired it.

"I will never understand why Microsoft made the choice to eliminate the standard headphone jack in the xbox one controllers, in favor of a proprietary connector.  Granted they have since seen the error and released an adapter and a new controller that has a standard jack.  However, I already own four controllers and do not want to replace them in order to get one that has a jack.As for the alternatives, they have issues.  When in game/party chat you can tell if someone is using a headset connected to one of these other options as it will either produce echo or a ring within the party that everyone but the user producing it can hear.Finally, I could live with the proprietary connection, if the product provided was a quality product.  This product is poorly made with the thinnest possible wire, which breaks easily.  I am now on my third headset and have done nothing with them that was abnormal.  Infact I did purchase one of the adapters, which comes with a dongle to connect a standard 2.5mm headset, that dongle made with the same wire as the headset also failed.  leaving me without a headset again.  I suspect that dongle was responsible for much of the in party noise.Many would argue that I should get turtle beach headset.  Those users are not enjoying the true sound capabilities of games mastered in 5.1 and 7.1.  Even ""Surround"" headphones cannot compare with a true surround system.  A 2.5cm speaker cannot compete with a 15"" 1000watt subwoofer for producing base.  And even a few micro drivers baked into a head set cannot truly emmulate surround sound.  I use a 7.1 setup with Pioneer Elite Amp and Klipsch Reference speakers.  Why would I want to give that up to listen through a pair of headphones that mess with the audio balance in favor of amplifying footsteps instead of providing a well rounded audio experience?

"I have a family of 7 and most people in the home have more than one device.  This has greatly improved the situation where charging all those devices is concerned (the kids still find other reasons to fight).Previously I had a full power strip and was struggling to fit enough little bricks on it to charge all the devices.  Further most of the bricks provided 500ma charges resulting in longer charge times.  With this now we are able to charge all the devices at full speed.  Most of our devices are Apple based, so there is one port that is not as effective, but all the ports seem to charge apple devices with at least 1000mA, based on experience and other reviews.  I do not have the equipment to measure the current (not so lucky to be a Vine member).I also suspect that this device is much more efficient than individual power bricks.  When I get some time I am going to test that theory.In any case I am very happy with this charging station and whole-heartedly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REJKYKV3YBUPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHP6UVQ#wasThisHelpful","REJKYKV3YBUPU","A2GMZZ6TDYOHY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GMZZ6TDYOHY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently read several SOLR books, brushing up my skills making sure that I was current with the technology.  This was the best of the three in this go and the best SOLR resource I have found yet.  That said it falls short of the ""Mastering"" title, in favor of catering more to the beginning user.  If I find a better resource, I reserve the option to knock a star off for these reasons.The books that I read in order of preference were:Mastering Apache Solr: A practical guide to get to grips with Apache SolrScaling Big Data with Hadoop and Solr (Community Experience Distilled)Apache Solr High PerformanceWhile this book needed additional editing and was rife with problems that reflected a lack of editorial oversight, it was by far the best of these three books.The book provides a complete tutorial with step by step processes to implement everything discussed in the book.  There are complete code examples, and even a section providing Java examples, of each of the API commands, something lacking even on the Internet.Chapter 1 provides an excellent overview of the SOLR project and Lucene core.  By the end of chapter 1 you will have setup a SOLR instance and indexed some documents and be ready follow along with the remainder of the book.Chapter 2 is a deep dive into schema.  Using the MusicBrainz data as an example it illustrates how to create a schema for this data step by step.  There is detailed coverage of each parameter with examples of when and when not to use each option.  There is a good introduction to Analyzers and Tokenizers.Chapter 3 covers importing from various formats.  This includes the commandline options to use the provided importers for XML and CSV, which facilitates loading the sample data for the exercises.  There is coverage on using Apache Tika to index binary document formats such as PDF, DOC or even DLL or JAR files.  There is brief coverage of deleting, committing and optimize.Chapter 4 covers querying.  The focus here is more on the various query arguments and parameters than the actual details of finding data.  That said it is a helpful overview of the various parameters and does well to cover how they can be used.Chapter 5 Advanced Querying does more to cover the actual details of building powerful queries.  It provides an excellent analysis of using DisMax eDisMax.  There is also good coverage of faceting, functions, highlighting, and geographical search.Chapter 6 covers Boosting Performance.  This chapter covers tuning Java heap, deactivating unused features, near realtime search, SOLR caching and replication.  The coverage here is good, but not great.  It is thorough in that it covers the options well, but falls short of really providing good guidance on the tradeoffs, and complications that come about in the real world.Chapter 7 Deploying SOLR.  I found this chapter to be a waste.  It is little more than copies of online setup tutorials.  It reaches too far trying to cover deployment in too many different containers, provides insufficient detail, and falls short of coverage of what is globally important when deploying SOLR.  What it did cover is left best to online tutorials for the various Java containers.  I would have much preferred coverage of the pitfalls of SOLR deployment in the real world.Chapter 8 Integration.  This chapter provides a good overview of performing basic operations in Java, PHP(PHP-Solr) and Ruby(RSOLR), with light coverage of other options.  I would have preferred better coverage of the REST interfaces, here, there was none though most of the operations were covered elsewhere in the book.  While Java was useful to me, I prefer Perl and Python to Ruby or PHP so that was of little benefit to me, though there are wide users bases of those libraries, documentation of these various interfaces is generally better than what is contained in this chapter.Chapter 9 SolrCloud is a good addition and provides the best coverage of SolrCloud I have seen in print.  It provided some details I could not even find online.  In particular it had good coverage of splitting shards.  However, it fell short in that it didn't fully cover how to reallocate those shards within the cluster.  It seems there are as of yet no good resources when it comes to balancing shards within SolrCloud.In summary it was a very good read and helped immensely, but ultimate I think it falls short of the ""Mastering"" title.  I think that some of the primers could be omitted in favor of deeper detail on some subjects as noted above, in a ""Mastering"" book.  As it stands this is a good intro to intermediate title, but will have useful information for SOLR users at all but the mastery level.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAFK9ROMRWWZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K67YYLS#wasThisHelpful","RAFK9ROMRWWZW","A2GMZZ6TDYOHY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GMZZ6TDYOHY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently read several SOLR books, brushing up my skills making sure that I was current with the technology.  This fell short of the others and the promise of its title.The books that I read in order of preference were:Mastering Apache Solr: A practical guide to get to grips with Apache SolrScaling Big Data with Hadoop and Solr (Community Experience Distilled)Apache Solr High PerformanceThis book contains what I consider to be one of the most bizarre inclusions, Chapter 1 shows how to install SOLR as a service on windows.  Why you would ever want to do that is beyond me, I can only assume that the offer felt this inclusion would make the topic more accessible to those on the Windows platform.  I certainly hope nobody intends to run a serious SOLR installation on the Windows platform.  This is a recipe for frustration.  If however you are insistent in running on Windows, this is the book for you.Chapter 2 provides excellent coverage of scoring and the various ways to leverage and control scoring within SOLR.Chapter 3 is about performance optimization.  This chapter is good, but really just talks about the features that make SOLR performant. It provides detail on how to configure and use those features, but it does not address what I have found in my experience to be the crux of the problem of SOLR performance, system tuning.Chapter 4 is labelled Additional Performance Optimization, but has little to do with performance and more to do with advanced SOLR features.  In fact use of most of these features can severely impact performance.  This chapter covers similar document queries, sorting by function, homophones, stopwords and word filtering.Chapter 5 is Troubleshooting.  This chapter covers some very common scenarios that will inevitably happen in a production SOLR environment.  If nothing else the list of scenarios can be very useful in creating your disaster recovery plan.  That said, the list is not really complete, and the coverage is light.  For example one of the sections is basically just covering the use of optimize, as though that is a troubleshooting technique, and not a regular best practice.  The section on garbage collection is a good start, but really any book on SOLR should have a chapter dedicated to GC.Chapter 6 is poorly named, ""Performance Optimization with ZooKeeper"".  It should have just been named ""ZooKeeper"".  ZooKeeper does nothing to improve the performance of SOLR, though it is a requisite stepping stone to the world of SOLR Cloud.  This chapter also does not discuss in detail making ZooKeeper performant.  Rather this chapter is a ZooKeeper tutorial, and a pretty good one.And the book abruptly ends.  No further coverage of SOLR Cloud.  No coverage of high performance indexing or data ingestion.  No discussion of tuning SOLR for large installations, scaling search, balancing memory allocations, and so on.  There is a smattering of information throughout about performance optimized schemas, but it is not collected or concise.  I feel like the author hit his deadline and submitted what he had.This book was a good start, but falls short of being more than an introduction to SOLR and certainly does not live up to its name.  This book provided very little in the way of code samples.  Most of the topics were covered at a very high level without significant detail.  For these reasons I rate it 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ57TESSVM8KC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J9B1IQG#wasThisHelpful","RZ57TESSVM8KC","A2GMZZ6TDYOHY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GMZZ6TDYOHY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Most of the topics were covered at a very high level without significant detail.  For this reason I cannot rate it 5 stars.  The book does contain command line examples to accomplish various tasks, but little in the way of detail in the options of those command lines such that if the example is not precisely what you need the book provides no guidance on how you would customize the command.The book provides good coverage of the configuration options for solr, both in the server config and schema.

"So far I have enjoyed this book, however it falls short of what I would expect from a ""Mastering"" book.  As an ElasticSearch consultant I have some experience working with the platform and doing some advanced work.  While this book does a very good job of introducing ElasticSearch and providing a reasonably through platform to build on, there are many advanced topics that are not covered.  There were a few times where I went to this book to find further information and found major features not even existing in the index of the book.  Overall the information is good, but falls short.For instance, the term scan is not found in the index, indicating the book has no coverage of scan queries, a fairly important advanced topic which deserves coverage in a Mastering level book.  You cannot Master ElasticSearch without knowing scan queries.  Chapter 8 provides some coverage of the poorly documented Java API.  It contains code snippets, that are almost useful.  That is it shows how to get a result set for each of the API commands, but not how to use that result set.  While this is fine for say the delete index command, it is not so helpful with the get aliases command.  While often I would consider attempting to write about such in a book to be redundant, the current state of the ElasticSearch javadocs and the inconsistency of that API, demand that we need a more thorough source of information which users can reference when trying to do even simple tasks with the API.All in all however, if you were to ask which ElasticSearch book to buy, this is the one I would recommend today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KXSNXYO380FF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=178328143X#wasThisHelpful","R3KXSNXYO380FF","A2GMZZ6TDYOHY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GMZZ6TDYOHY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first started drip watering and bought a package of assorted parts, I saw the cute little elbows and laughed.  I thought surely there is no need for these, the hose is more than flexible enough, what could I possible need these for.  How wrong I was.I use drip watering in my garden where I have to remove it each year to till and amend the soil.  I then return the system and use it's flexibility to water each plant individually, automatically.  I have attached to my timed sprinkling system and have a 1"" rigid pipe that acts as a backbone to my garden system.  This rigid pipe has a spigot every 20 ft to which I attach a 1/2"" flexible tubing using barbs I attach 1/4"" driplines with mini sprinklers or drippers to each plant.  When I started I used straigh barbs to pierce the 1/2"" and attach the 1/4"" lines.  When I went to remove it from the garden the next year I had a problem, the barbs started snapping due to the strain.It dawned on me that if instead of using the straight barbs, I used the elbows they would be able to pivot on the main line and would have less strain.  I have not had a problem with breaking barbs since I moved to the elbows instead of the straight barbs.  At the same time I have replaced nearly every straight barb I used  as they have all broken.If you are going to do drip watering you need the elbows, they are not for making neat corners in your tubing, they are for attaching the smaller 1/4"" line to the larger 1/2"" flex tube.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKM1TVGTPQ15D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00081QCHQ#wasThisHelpful","RKM1TVGTPQ15D","A2GMZZ6TDYOHY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GMZZ6TDYOHY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always enjoyed my Dell flat-screens and felt they were a grade above the alternatives in build quality.  As an IT professional I get hands on with many others and have not seen or used one that I preferred to my Dell.However, my Dell monitors have always been purchased by my employer, at significant expense.So when I needed a monitor due to taking a new job I went to work trying to find one that I would be happy with.  When I came across this one I was very happy to see that there was an option to have another Dell that would meet my needs, that I could afford.  I was very tempted to step up and buy the more expensive model to get the claimed color accuracy but am satisfied that I did not.After using this monitor for a month, I am very satisfied with it.  The screen is definitely larger than the one I was using before, I thought it was a 24 as well but perhaps not.  I am very happy that it is 1920x1200.  It pairs perfectly with my Dell 2007FP which is 1600x1200.  The 1680x1050 I was using before always annoyed me that it was larger but with lower resolution, I never understood that trend in the industry.  This monitor is notably brighter and whiter than the Dell2007FP it sits next too.  Out of the box I had to reduce the brightness, it was just too much.In summary I will say unless you are a professional in need of perfect color matching, I cannot see a reason that you would be disappointed with this monitor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QKZIHLL4A7JA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JN9310#wasThisHelpful","R1QKZIHLL4A7JA","A2GMZZ6TDYOHY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GMZZ6TDYOHY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great value for the money, I usually buy 2 quart bottles and then transfer to an 8 oz bottle for easier use.  For my use, I mix this VG with the e juice that I purchase from other vendors in a 50/50 mix.  Usually my juice is 3mg and I prefer something with less nicotine but more than 0 nic level.  Currently, I have a lot of different juices that I mix this way, it not only drops the nicotine level, but it stretches my juices out until the next payday.

"I have a red Cool Fire IV which I bought from my buddy who owns a vape shop here locally.  I am definitely considering getting another one of these bad boys, as the size is right and with the iSub tank or the iSub G tank both of these are from Innokin are small enough yet amazingly hold 4 mls for the iSub and 4.5 mls for the iSub G tank. The cool Fire IV and an iSub tank you have a killer combo that will have you blowing some big time clouds.  When your done creating the cloud bank in your living room you can tuck the device with the tank into a pocket, then play dumb when some body asks who made this fog bank?  Seriously though, this is an all around great little device, you can turn the device off one of two ways; firstly you can tap the fire button 3 times and it will power down the device.  Secondly; you can turn the switch on the bottom of the device to the off position and this will power down the device as well.  Just don't make the same mistake I did when I first got mine;  I knew about the switch on the bottom,from youtube videos I watched.  However when I got mine, attached an atty, tapped the fire button 3 times...nothing..tried it again...nothing, took my atty off, tried again...nothing.  By now I'm gettin pissed cause this brand new device isn't working...WTF over!!  It was then I remembered the switch..that little switch on the bottom that was the root of my problem, after that, I have never turned it off, no reason to as it gets used daily and I figure if I really need to turn it off I will just use the 3 clicks of the fire button.  Guess that about wraps up my review of the Innokin Cool Fire IV 40 watt box mod, small on size..big on power.

"Bought this device about a month maybe 6 weeks ago from another online vendor, wanted a device that would be capable of at least 50 watts,60 watts is more preferable.  The MVP 3.0 Pro from Innokin is the cats ass, will fire down to a .2 ohm coil, up to around 3.0 ohms so this will work with the majority of tanks and clearomizers on the market today.  I have seen anything from a Protank, Aerotanks using a 1.8 ohm coil to a Stilare RDA, a Turbo RDA that has a small turbine fan in side.  The Turbo is probably my favorite RDA for the MVP 3.0, with my Stilare and Stilare V3 being my second choice.  I have also used a couple of my sub ohm tanks like my Atlantis, my Melo, or my STARRE sub tanks work well too.  With the MVP 3.o Pro being such a versatile device, nott only can you vape a day or two with the large 4500 mAh battery, you can with the integral micro USB cable can charge an Android phone, a digital camera, an Android tablet, any device that uses a micro USB end you can charge it up.  Heck..I've even used mine to charge up my Cool Fire IV also made by Innokin.  The battery on this lasts and lasts I can get 2-3 days in between charges with this device.  My only wish would be that they would have made the other end of the charge cable a lightening end so I can charge my iPhone 6+ or my iPad Air, not a big deal, as ther is a USB port on the bottom of the device and a switch so you can take your charge/data cable for your iPhone/iPad and charge it as well, s I have tried that as well.  Works well, and was able to charge my phone up enough to last me until I could get to my truck and plug in to a 12 volt system and charge my phone the rest of the way to full.  What else, I've covered the drippers, and clearos, the sub tanks, charging other devices while you vape.  Speaking of charging while you vape, once you have your MVP 3.0 Pro plugged in to charge, you can vape while charging or as it is more commonly called pass though...vape while you charge, makes it nice because if this is your only device..you would be s*** out of luck if you couldn't use this as a pass through device.  I any event, this in my humble opinion is probably Innokin's finest device.  I have been an Innokin fan from almost the time I started vaping, I have the iTaste v3 with the 800 mAh battery, had two, lost one, bought another, then my original iaste started acting up so I bought an iTaste v4 with the 1000 mAh battery, I've had the MVP 2.0, still have my original, plus another, I also have the 20 watt and now the MVP 3.0 Pro 60 watt device.  Innokin, always has been on the cutting edge and their products are second to none, the iSub tanks go well with this device, so there is another option  as well as a Kanger sub tank or any of the myriad sub tanks on the market today.  Thank you all for taking the time to read my review of the Innokin MVP 3.0 Pro 60 watt box mod. Get one for yourself, get one for a family member or your wife if she vapes, as this is the best that there is in this wattage range and for the price..you can't beat it.

"I only have one of these batteries, bought from a local vape shop who did recommend this battery highly.  I was lucky as the day I bought mine he did have a couple left in stock.  Seems as though these fly off the shelf quicker than eggs through a hen, that said; I don't know if these are rewraps or if they are Samsung, LG, Sony..whatever.  All I care about is..does it work, if so..how well, how long does it last, etc.  This is what I have discovered with this battery; Currently this battery is in myy iPV mini running a 1 ohm coil in my Atlantis V1 at 27.5-30 watts, it does an exceptional job in that capacity.  I get at least a full day out of this battery, no errors, no nothing, it just works and works well.  So what if it has been rewraped..it works doesn't it..as long as the buyer is aware that this may be a battery that has a different wrapper than what you may think it should.  As long as you practice safe vaping and don't get stupid and try and have a build that is wayy too low for this battery/batteries to be safe, as long as when you insert this battery into whatever device it is that you are using, you have the battery in correctly and not backwards, that your device powers on and the atty that you have on your device is compatible who cares what it looks like, I could give a s*** less weather or not it had any wrap on it at all. Put some brown paper from a paper bag and call it what ever you want, buy a truck load rewrap them yourself sell them for just over what you paid for em, you'll have enough to buy more , then more, pretty soon you'll be the brown paper bag battery king or queen lol. Any way, I get good life out of this battery, it works every time I turn my iPV on and take a toke..hey I'm a happy camper.PS:  I must apologize for any grammatical errors, repeating myself, etc.  As a 100% disabled vet along with leg and back issues I also have memory and other...um...issues within the brain pan.

"I've had my Melo tank for..gosh around 4-5 months and in all that time have had zero problems with it.  I get great flavor, great clouds,(depending upon the juice I use of course..I prefer max VG). The coils last forever it seems, I'm getting between 4-6 weeks on some coils, with no degradation of flavor.  However when the coil goes...it goes, you get that burnt nasty taste and you know its time to change the coil.  If I have one nit pick it would be that this tank is just a tad bigger, I think this holds around 2.8mls. maybe 3mls but no more.  If they made a tank that held 3.5-4.0mls that would at least put it on par with the Kanger sub tank mini, or even the Innokin iSub and iSub G tank series.  There is a fix for this, I found the Atlantis 5ml replacement tank will fit and work just fine on the Melo base, matter of fact the Atlantis coils are a great substitute for the Melo coils if you happen to run out.  Up until recently I had an Atlantis 5ml replacement and replaced that with the 7ml replacement tank.  Both worked superbly with no issues what so ever.  I wound up buying a couple of clone Atlantis bases and a 5ml glass tank, and now have 3 Atlantis V1 clone sub tanks, put the original tank back on the Melo base and have the Melo tank.  I also recently won a Kanger Tech Subox mini kit which is very nice indeed.  So I have a Kanger sub tank mini, and recently traded a Kayfun clone for a Kanger sub tank V1 the 6ml version, the sub tank plus the latest version holds 7mls, 6ml and 4.5ml is enough for my Kanger setup...for now.  Eventually maybe all the Kanger sub tanks, but for now..the Melo sub tank is a winner in my book.  You get great flavor, can create a fog bank in your living room...ask me how I know this!  My wife came in and said to me..you do know there is a fog bank in our living room, I looked up from my laptop..sure enough our fairly large living room had a cloud bank that was um...quite thick, especially in and around my couch.  Any way, I can brag on this tank all day, until you get one and see for yourself and see for yourself what a really nice tank this is, all my talking doesn't mean squat.  Get one, you'll thank me eventually.  Be well, be safe,VAPE ON!PS: In my photo I have my iStick Melo sub tank on an Elitel 50 watt box mod this device is produced by a company called Luxyoun in China..where else.  This device is a little wonky, its no Siegelei by any stretch, but it does OK for my needs.  I'm running a 0.5 ohm coil at 33 watts giving me around 4 volts, for me that good at this time, who is to say an day from now I won't have it up to 35-40 watts, but for now, its all good.

"WOW..what a kick ass little mod the Kanger Subox is!  I did not purchase mine from Amazon, I actually won mine from a contest on ecig.com.  I will say that the new version of the sub tank mini is a hell of a lot better than the original version.  I had the first gen sub ohm tank from Kanger, it was a decn't tank, and I could do a decent build on the RBA deck, but this latest version is killer!  Now I will add a caveat to my statement concerning this new and improved version of the subtank.  While it oes blow some great clouds using the standard coils that come with this tank.  I also have the original sub tank, not the plus, but the first gen sub tank from Kanger, consequently I also have coils for the first gen that can be used in any version.  However; what I am finding from my own personal experience and use is that the older stock OCC coils are decnt, they are no match for the new 2nd gen version of the OCC coils.  The new coils offer much better flavor and clouds than the 1st gen OCC coils.  My advice, find a local vape shop or shop on line get you some Kanger OCC coils V2.  They will work in all the Kanger sub ohm tanks and I belieeve they do the Kanger sub tanks much better justice.  Not that the original OCC coils are bad...they are not, ya just gotta drop your wattage down a bit to between 20-35 watts depending on the juice you are using.  I'm sucking on mine right now using a 1st gen OCC coil with Rocky Top Vapor Audio Fog Mabgo Melon max VG juice at about 25-27.5 watts and its doing just fine.  Much more than that and it starts tasting burnt..you might get to 30 watts with this juice but no more.  Id this was one of the new coils I could crank this up to around 35-37 watts with no problem using a 0.5 ohm coil.Now, as for the box mod itself...what a gem!  The nice thing about this is the fact you can just pop a fresh battery in whenever the one you are using is depleted.  Or, knowing that your battery is getting low, you can always take the the micro USB cor that comes with this package, plug one end into the mod, the other end into a wall adapter, or a free USB port on your computer.  I do prefer plugging in to the wall, or just replacing the battery with a fresh one.  Using your computer will take entirely too long and personally I feel an exercise in frustration. On a positive note though, if you are plugged into your computer you can vape while you are doing whatever it is you're doing on your computer.  At 50 watts..this box mod gives you plenty of power in a small package that is easily hid in a shirt pocket or for you ladies; in an outside pocket of your purse.  So; you get a 50 watt box mod a sub ohm tank that will hold 4.5mls of your favorite juice, an RBA deck so you can build your own coils.  You also receive a 0.5 and a 1.5 ohm coil V2 some small squares of organic Japanese cotton so you can build a coil or two.  A micro USB cable to charge your device.  Only other things ya gotta buy is a good high drain battery of at least 20 amps.  I have 2 of the Efest purple batteries that are 2100 mAh  30A IMR 18650 3.7 volt Li-Mn batteries, also have 4 VTC-4 batteries which I really like.  Pretty much any IMR high drain 18650 Li-Mn 20-35 amp battery will work.  Just make sure it is rated at 20 amps or better,and you'll be fine, these kits can be had far and wide on the internet for about $60-$100.  While this is a great kit, kicks ass every which way it can, I don't feel this is a $100 mod, just my humble opinion, I could see about $80-$90, which I think if I had to pay for mine was around $85.00.  Get yerself one this is a great bit of kit no reason now to not sub ohm vape.

"This item I've had for..roughly 2-3 weeks now, it is nice, made of delrin therefore will hold up to my use and some time abuse, whenever I screw up and my mod rolls off whatever its on and lands on the floor...that kind of abuse.  Unintentional abuse..how about that..works for me.  That said, I can really only give it 4 stars, because yes this will fit on my Plume Veil, but not my Stilare, nor will it ft on my Stilare ver 3.  Let me rephrase that last statement, or make things a bit clearer; it fits, just not well, very very loose on my Stilare bot the first gen and ver.3  the Plume Veil, fits on and works very well, really wanted one for my Stilare and the ver 3 Stilare.  I do have a couple other drippers that this will kinda work with as well.  I really wanted this for the Stilare, figured if it worked then I would order another so I could use it with my other Stilare.  well...ya win some and ya loose some.

"This is one small, flat, biggest readout multimeter that I've seen.  Get you one of these..if you are like me and space is a real concern..you could do worse than to get one of these VOM or by its better known name..a multimeter.  What I like about it is the compactness of it and the many features it carries other than reading voltage, ohms,etc. For me and the many uses I have for a multimeter this one I can throw i my pocket and go, not have to worry about am I gonna break it or not.The display readout is awesome, large numbers,large enough for my eyes to read it so that is sufficient for me.  I have a large multifunction multimeter, that has the ammeter or amp readings, so all ya gotta do is push the button it opens a set of hands or pinchers ya stick around the wire an it will show you what kind of load you are pulling, etc.  Its nice, but every time I build a coil for my E Cigarette, I don't want to have to dig that big ol honkin thing just to read what the ohm or what the sub ohm reading is.

My daughter like myself is a disabled vet, she is at 60%, I'm at 100%.  My daughter like this as it will hold her cigalike..no, its better than a cigalike but it the same size any way, it holds her little battery and she is a happy camper.For my use..I like the XL size, use it for my tube mech mods and it works...that's it..it just plain works.  Could used something like this a year ago, that was before I knew anything.  Been vaping 2 years now and this by far is the best little device for holding your mod in place and not havin it with your nice new Lemo tank and the whole mess rolls of the table and the little glass tube explodes!! It happened to me just about a month ago.SO, THE XL SIZE WORKS BEST FOR ME!!Thank y'all for making a product that is inexpensive, lightweight, ad works like a charm!  Will definitely look y'all up and check ut your website to see what other products y'all have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDBV06BLJIV37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1SXCIS#wasThisHelpful","RDBV06BLJIV37","AUWEVS6HSG33H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUWEVS6HSG33H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are 3.7 volt 1200mAh Li-ion type batteries.  For me I use them in my mini Lambo battery mod for vaping.  The 900mAh battery that came with my mini Lambo is decent enough , but I wanted something a little longer lasting.  Can't say one way or the other....yet.  These 2 and my 900mAh battery all last about the same length of time.  Although I can usually go all day with one of thes batteries and my 900mAh will give me most of a day.Bottom line; these would work extremely well in an l.e.d flashlight or a camera, but will do a yoemans job for pretty much any of your vaping needs.  These are relatively inexpensive enough so get 2 sets and you'll be good to go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DVYZTOPWLQ10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GRFZGM#wasThisHelpful","R1DVYZTOPWLQ10","AUWEVS6HSG33H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUWEVS6HSG33H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the heading states...WOW...what a sharpener!  This has exceeded my expectations, when I used this on an old...I mean really old hand ax I had lying around.  I figured just for giggles and grins I would attempt to sharpen this old hand ax, what turned out a half hour or so later was a nice sharp hatchet.  Now, I'm not sayin this was razor sharp, or anything like that, but it was sharp enough to trim some limbs of a tree that was in need of trimming.That said, the sharpener arrived as always quickly, well before the stated date of delivery.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quick ax,machete, hatchet quick sharpener.

"Well, how do I begin...as you can see by the stars above I love it!  This is a really, really nifty neat stylus/pen combo, I was a bit taken aback when I first saw this stylus out of the package.  I had expected something..I don't know..a bit longer perhaps.  I was expecting a full size pen, with the stylus making up the cap portion of the pen as I have seen others in the stores at 2 and 3 times the price of this pen/stylus.  So, I'm sitting here wondering if I had made a mistake in ordering this, so, with trembling hands I opened the package took the pen out and tried the stylus on my Galaxy SII smartphone.  WOW, this is really nice, smooth, can go up, down, left, right, any way in between without the stylus sticking to the screen for an instant like some of the styluses I've had in the past.  OK, so it works on my phone, what about, my Galaxy Tab, my 7"" first gen tablet..works well with this tablet, what about...my Asus TF-300T 10"" tablet?  How well with this dinky little stylus work with a full size tablet.  I figured there would be something, some kind of glitch that would cause a problem.  But no, it worked perfectly, no glitches, no sticking to the screen, just smooth operation from start to finish.  Y'all gotta realize, I did not test ALL my equipment in one day, In all, I guess it was about 3 days it took me to test the stylus on my equipment.  The pen on the other hand, didn't really get to the pen for a week, 10 days later.  I knew the pen would write, that wasn't the question, I scribbled on piece of paper so I knew the pen worked.I am a bit finicky about my pens, some I like to have fine point, others a medium point. This is somewhere in between I think, not real sure.  I like the pen, I know there isn't an ""in between"" point on pens, either fine, medium, or heavy I think is the term.The pen writes very nice..for me, others may or may not like it, but me personally, I like the way this pen writes, when it comes time for a refill, you can bet I'm gonna be lookin on Amazon.com.  Overall, its a small package that does a big job, very well. Each part compliments the other, if there has to be a dislike, I guess it would be that the stylus isn't part of the cap like I have seen others of this type.  For now, when you take the cap off its off, then it is small, almost too small.  Fortunately I don't have big hands, nor are they small either. I know sooner or later I will be using this somewhere or someplace and will forget it or forget where I put it, when..not if, when that happens, I will come right back to Amazon and purchase a new one, I probably should any way, just so I have an extra one..or two.The vendor for this device is easy to deal with, ships promptly.  This item, for whatever reason was on hold or back ordered,which just goes to show how popular this item really is.  Get another one..or two..or more....YOU BETCHA I will.  If you have a smartphone, or tablet or both, hell, even one of these new touch screen computers they have now, this will in all probability work on it as well.  Get one, try it out and let me know!  Great litlle device, I highly recommend this device.

"This is a pretty much self explanatory app.  You set it up per your user preferences, if you are originally from say......Kansas City, Kansas, and you're living in LA now, you can set this app up to get broadcasts from Kansas City PD, the fire dept, weather, even amateur radio repeaters from your home town.  This is one of those apps that has its place for all of us that wish we were part of the action, but glad we're not.  After 25+ years in law enforcement, and have owned several scanners in my time, and although I don't currently own the latest in a digital spread spectrum top of the line scanner.  I still have a digital scanner in my pocket thanks to scanner radioYa gotta love those guys and gals who of there own free will take the time to set up there own scanners and allow those of us that want to listen can listen.  I would hazard a guess that most of us have a favorite or two or three set frequencies if you will, well, with this app, you can set up your favorites list and you can just pick and chose which one you want to listen to for the first hour or two.  Or maybe one of your favorites is quiet tonight, you take a chance and see whats going on in the land down under, yep, we can listen to the brave men and women in uniform in Australia.  While its no hand held scanner that you can set up, program, have an antenna on the roof of your home and all, bt this isn't a bad substitute, try it, couldn't hurt, you may just be the next action junkie.  Have fun with this, don't become an ambulance chaser, you may wind up being the topic of discussion for that evening, not sayin, just sayin, be smart and be safe, enjoy the app for what it is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LSGEKV4TS102/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DLNC4I#wasThisHelpful","R2LSGEKV4TS102","AUWEVS6HSG33H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUWEVS6HSG33H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so thankful for the smartphones we have on the market today, for if there were no smartphones, there would be no Amazon Mobile app.  That said, I have this app on all 3 of my devices, my Samsung Galaxy SII  Epic Touch 4G/D710, my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7"" tablet, and my Asus TF300T Transformer 10"" tablet, its one of those apps that you never knew how you lived without it.

Lets face it, in todays day & age with so many hand held gadgets about, it only makes sense to have a car charger.  Most of you have a car charger for your smartphone or cell phone as the case may be don't cha, well, being out and about as much or as little as I am, it only made sense to get a car charger for my HT as well.  Originally I bought this for my TH-F6A, fortunately, when 6 weeks ago I bought my TH-D72A dual band HT, the 2 HT's shared the same house charger, so I wondered weather or not the two HT's would share the same car charger, fortunately they do, so that is one less expense for me.  I can honestly say, that any device I own that operates on rechargeable batteries, I have a car charger for it.  My 2 HT's, my smartphone, my 7"" Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet, and my Asus 10"" tablet, I have car chargers for each and every one of em, cheap insurance if you ask me.  Here in Fl. we are often in the way of hurricanes, we are fortunately rarely hit by one, however, past experience has taught me the benefit of having car chargers, so when power fails, I can still charge my HT's which will be of more use than my smartphone other than amusement which the smartphone can keep me amused for hours.That said, this charger is sold at a very decent price, less than what you can get it for at any of the amateur radio stores either in person or on line.

"This is a replacement, had one of these previously, when a couple of weeks ago my Galaxy SII developed a serious problem.  My phone would not charge, I couldn't charge my phone in any way shape or form, something in the charging circuit, or something with the phone itself prevented the phone from charging.  When I took the phone in, I was told the charging port was toast and I would need a new phone.  All I can say on that...thankfully I had insurance on my device, cause there is NO way I would have been able to buy a new phone.  So, for the next week I had to take my batteries in twice a day...not to get charged.  The very first day I took my batteries in, (I actually found the stock battery for my phone) to be charged, the guy at the Sprint Service store put my extended battery on charge, the charger kept beeping, and when they checked my extended battery was toast as well!  I said to the service tech, how can this be, I don't think I've had this battery a year yet, well between the two of us, we deduced that there was something going on inside the phone other than the charging port being bad, like maybe the entire charging circuit as I had said before, don't know, but these batteries are killer.  For 11-12 bucks vs the fifty something you pay at Best Buy for the extended battery, ya can't beat em, these batteries are rock solid last me all day, where as the standard battery will get me 3-6 hours depending upon usage, these extended battery will give me ALL day!  I can surf the web, check my email, play a game or two or 6, and watch a movie if I like, and this extended battery will see it through.

"Here I go again going off half aware of what is right in front of me.  Saw this app the other day, and said to my self...self, that looks like something you could use.  Truly says I, so, I spent the 99 cents to get this app, only to my horror after downloading I see in bold lettering I missed the first time,(Kindle Tablet Edition). Well, at first I'm thinking, great Mark, here you go, forking over your hard earned 99 cents to get an app that ain't gonna work.  Wait, wait a minute now say I to myself, just because it says Kindle Tablet Edition, doesn't mean it wont work now...will it?  Only one way to find out I said to myself, and that...is to try it!  Downloaded a couple of movies, 3 stooges being one of my all time favorites, it was a natural selection, and growing up when Gilligan's Island was on,(first run, yep, I'm dating myself).  It works says I, so it does says self, for once we are both in total agreement, it works.  Now, how well it works is still up for discussion, I will do some more field testing and will give another review in a month or so, that is if me, myself and I can all come to the same agreement:-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R179VR15X26SMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0093QQAEM#wasThisHelpful","R179VR15X26SMQ","AUWEVS6HSG33H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUWEVS6HSG33H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Greetings, as a ham radio operator I can and probably will put these items to good use here at home, and in the field.  That said, it was very late when I was perusing Amazon and thought I was ordering something else when I ordered these.  I will in all probably go ahead and look around and get an adapter for the ends of these and use it for another project that I am working on.  Other than that these are nifty and have a lot of uses.Order or rather delivery time was about 2 weeks, maybe a day or two less, but around 2 weeks.they weren't supposed to be due to be delivered until some time in May around the middle of the month I think, so the shortened delivery time wasn't so bad.  Yea, even knowing what I now know, I will probably use the same seller again if and when needed.

"I have been needing a car charger for my Asus TF300 T ""Transformer"" tablet for some time now.  When I happened upon this charger here on Amazon.  The price was right, about $20 I think it was, no more than $25 for sure, heck, even if it was rtwice the price I probably would have sprung for it.  This is cheap insurance folks, every thing I have, if I can, I have a car charger for it.  My cell phone, a Galaxy SII, my Asus tablet, my Samsung Galaxy 7"" tablet, my 2 ham radio hand held transceivers, I have car chargers for each and every one of these.  Why, cause here in Florida we have those nasty storms they call hurricanes, and besides, I am on the go, maybe not as often as I would like, but I still do get out and out of town with my wife its nice to not have to worry about weather or not my tablet is going to have juice or not when ever we get to where we are going.  Just cheap insurance is all. This works on my tablet fine business, no issues, just plug into your cars cigar lighter socket, plug the other end into you tablet, and you are charging...OH..it works to charge the keyboard as well, so that way when ever you're on a trip, you wont have to worry, your tablet and keyboard will be charged up and ready to go.The item arrived way faster than I would have thought given the first approximate date of arrival, which I think was 3 or 4 weeks hence, this charger arrived within a week, so can't complain at all on that end,  Yes, I will definitely when the time comes for me to purchase another odd or end for mt tablet or phone to purchase from this seller again, thank you all for taking the time to read my review, hopefully this will help those who can't decide weather or not to go ahead and get this nifty little charger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REW0VD75CCLUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QUHFGY#wasThisHelpful","REW0VD75CCLUR","AUWEVS6HSG33H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUWEVS6HSG33H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
